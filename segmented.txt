lingers
my
desires
like
to
a
step
dame
or
a
dowager
long
withering
out
a
young
mans
revenue
four
days
will
quickly
steep
themselves
in
night
four
nights
will
quickly
dream
away
the
time
and
then
the
moon
like
to
a
silver
bow
newbent
in
heaven
shall
behold
the
night
of
our
solemnities
go
philostrate
stir
up
the
athenian
youth
to
merriments
awake
the
pert
and
nimble
spirit
of
mirth
turn
melancholy
forth
to
funerals
the
pale
companion

not
for
our
pomp

my

heart
turnd

with
demetrius
i
beg
the
ancient
privilege
of
athens
as
she
is
mine
i
may
dispose
of
her
which
shall
be
either
to
this
gentleman
or
to
her
death
according
to
our
law
immediately
provided
in
that
case
what
say
you
hermia
be
advisd
fair
maid
to
you
your
father
should
be
as
a
god
one
that
composd
your
beauties
yea
and
one
to
whom
you
are
but
as
a
form
in
wax
by
him
imprinted
and
within
his
power
to
leave
the
figure
or
disfigure
it
demetrius
is
a
worthy
gentleman
so
is
lysander
in
himself
he
is
but
in
this
kind
wanting
your
fathers
voice
the
other
must
be
held
the
worthier
i
would
my
father
lookd
but
with
my
eyes
rather
your
eyes
must
with
his
judgment
look
i
do
entreat
your
grace
to
pardon
me
i
know
not
by
what
power
i
am
made
bold
nor
how
it
may
concern
my
modesty
in
such
a
presence
here
to
plead
my
thoughts
but
i
beseech
your
grace
that
i
may
know
the
worst
that
may
befall
me
in
this
case
if
i
refuse
to
wed
demetrius
either
to
die
the
death
or
to
abjure
for
ever
the
society
of
men
therefore
fair
hermia
question
your
desires
know
of
your
youth
examine
well
your
blood
wher
if
you
yield
not
to
your
fathers
choice
you
can
endure
the
livery
of
a
nun
for
aye
to
be
in
shady
cloister
mewd
to
live
a
barren
sister
all
your
life
chanting
faint
hymns
to
the
cold
fruitless
moon
thrice
blessed
they
that
master
so
their
blood
to
undergo
such
maiden
pilgrimage
but
earthlier
happy
is
the
rose
distilld
than
that
which
withering
on
the
virgin
thorn
grows
lives
and
dies
in
single
blessedness
so
will
i
grow
so
live
so
die
my
lord
ere
i
will
yield
my
virgin
patent
up
unto
his
lordship
whose
unwished
yoke
my
soul
consents
not
to
give
sovereignty
take
time
to
pause
and
by
the
next
new
moon
the
sealingday
betwixt
my
love
and
me
for
everlasting
bond
of
fellowship
upon
that
day
either
prepare
to
die
for
disobedience
to
your
fathers
will
or
else
to
wed
demetrius
as
he
would
or
on
dianas
altar
to
protest
for
aye
austerity
and
single
life
relent
sweet
hermia
and
lysander
yield
thy
crazed
title
to
my
certain
right
you
have
her
fathers
love
demetrius
let
me
have
hermias
do
you
marry
him
scornful
lysander
true
he
hath
my
love
and
what
is
mine
my
love
shall
render
him
and
she
is
mine
and
all
my
right
of
her
i
do
estate
unto
demetrius
i
am
my
lord
as
well
derivd
as
he
as
well
possessd
my
love
is
more
than
his
my
fortunes
every
way
as
fairly
rankd
if
not
with
vantage
as
demetrius
and
which
is
more
than
all
these
boasts
can
be
i
am
belovd
of
beauteous
hermia
why
should
not
i
then
prosecute
my
right
demetrius
ill
avouch
it
to
his
head
made
love
to
nedars
daughter
helena
and
won
her
soul
and
she
sweet
lady
dotes
devoutly
dotes
dotes
in
idolatry
upon
this
spotted
and
inconstant
man
i
must
confess
that
i
have
heard
so
much
and
with
demetrius
thought
to
have
spoke
thereof
but
being
overfull
of
selfaffairs
my
mind
did
lose
it
but
demetrius
come
and
come
egeus
you
shall
go
with
me
i
have
some
private
schooling
for
you
both
for
you
fair
hermia
look
you
arm
yourself
to
fit
your
fancies
to
your
fathers
will
or
else
the
law
of
athens
yields
you
up
which
by
no
means
we
may
extenuate
to
death
or
to
a
vow
of
single
life
come
my
hippolyta
what
cheer
my
love
demetrius
and
egeus
go
along
i
must
employ
you
in
some
business
against
our
nuptial
and
confer
with
you
of
something
nearly
that
concerns
yourselves
with
duty
and
desire
we
follow
you
how
now
my
love
why
is
your
cheek
so
pale
how
chance
the
roses
there
do
fade
so
fast
belike
for
want
of
rain
which
i
could
well
beteem
them
from
the
tempest
of
mine
eyes
ay
me
for
aught
that
ever
i
could
read
could
ever
hear
by
tale
or
history
the
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
but
either
it
was
different
in
blood
o
cross
too
high
to
be
enthralld
to
low
or
else
misgraffed
in
respect
of
years
o
spite
too
old
to
be
engagd
to
young
or
else
it
stood
upon
the
choice
of
friends
o
hell
to
choose
love
by
anothers
eye
or
if
there
were
a
sympathy
in
choice
war
death
or
sickness
did
lay
siege
to
it
making
it
momentany
as
a
sound
swift
as
a
shadow
short
as
any
dream
brief
as
the
lightning
in
the
collied
night
that
in
a
spleen
unfolds
both
heaven
and
earth
and
ere
a
man
hath
power
to
say
behold
the
jaws
of
darkness
do
devour
it
up
so
quick
bright
things
come
to
confusion
if
then
true
lovers
have
been
ever
crossd
it
stands
as
an
edict
in
destiny
then
let
us
teach
our
trial
patience
because
it
is
a
customary
cross
as
due
to
love
as
thoughts
and
dreams
and
sighs
wishes
and
tears
poor
fancys
followers
a
good
persuasion
therefore
hear
me
hermia
i
have
a
widow
aunt
a
dowager
of
great
revenue
and
she
hath
no
child
from
athens
is
her
house
remote
seven
leagues
and
she
respects
me
as
her
only
son
there
gentle
hermia
may
i
marry
thee
and
to
that
place
the
sharp
athenian
law
cannot
pursue
us
if
thou
lovst
me
then
steal
forth
thy
fathers
house
tomorrow
night
and
in
the
wood
a
league
without
the
town
where
i
did
meet
thee
once
with
helena
to
do
observance
to
a
morn
of
may
there
will
i
stay
for
thee
my
good
lysander
i
swear
to
thee
by
cupids
strongest
bow
by
his
best
arrow
with
the
golden
head
by
the
simplicity
of
venus
doves
by
that
which
knitteth
souls
and
prospers
loves
and
by
that
fire
which
burnd
the
carthage
queen
when
the
false
troyan
under
sail
was
seen
by
all
the
vows
that
ever
men
have
broke
in
number
more
than
ever
women
spoke
in
that
same
place
thou
hast
appointed
me
tomorrow
truly
will
i
meet
with
thee
keep
promise
love
look
here
comes
helena

you
me
fair

fair
again
unsay
demetrius
loves
your
fair
o
happy
fair
your
eyes
are
lodestars
and
your
tongues
sweet
air
more
tuneable
than
lark
to
shepherds
ear
when
wheat
is
green
when
hawthorn
buds
appear
sickness
is
catching
o
were

so
yours
would
i
catch
fair
hermia
ere
i
go
my
ear
should
catch
your
voice
my
eye
your
eye
my
tongue
should
catch
your
tongues
sweet
melody
were
the
world
mine
demetrius
being
bated
the
rest
id
give
to
be
to
you
translated
o
teach
me
how
you
look
and
with
what
art
you
sway
the
motion
of
demetrius
heart
i
frown
upon
him
yet
he
loves
me
still
o
that
your
frowns
would
teach
my
smiles
such
skill
i
give
him
curses
yet
he
gives
me
love
o
that
my
prayers
could
such
affection
move
the
more
i
hate
the
more
he
follows
me
the
more
i
love
the
more
he
hateth
me
his
folly
helena
is
no
fault
of
mine
none
but
your
beauty
would
that
fault
were
mine
take
comfort
he
no
more
shall
see
my
face
lysander
and
myself
will
fly
this
place
before
the
time
i
did
lysander
see
seemd
athens
as
a
paradise
to
me
o
then
what
graces
in
my
love
do
dwell
that
he
hath
turnd
a
heaven
unto
a
hell
helen
to
you
our
minds
we
will
unfold
tomorrow
night
when
ph
be
doth
behold
her
silver
visage
in
the
watry
glass
decking
with
liquid
pearl
the
bladed
grass
a
time
that
lovers
flights
doth
still
conceal
through
athens
gates
have
we
devisd
to
steal
and
in
the
wood
where
often
you
and
i
upon
faint
primrosebeds
were
wont
to
lie
emptying
our
bosoms
of
their
counsel
sweet
there
my
lysander
and
myself
shall
meet
and
thence
from
athens
turn
away
our
eyes
to
seek
new
friends
and
stranger
companies
farewell
sweet
playfellow
pray
thou
for
us
and
good
luck
grant
thee
thy
demetrius
keep
word
lysander
we
must
starve
our
sight
from
lovers
food
till
morrow
deep
midnight
i
will
my
hermia
helena
adieu
as
you
on
him
demetrius
dote
on
you
how
happy
some
oer
other
some
can
be
through
athens
i
am
thought
as
fair
as
she
but
what
of
that
demetrius
thinks
not
so
he
will
not
know
what
all
but
he
do
know
and
as
he
errs
doting
on
hermias
eyes
so
i
admiring
of
his
qualities
things
base
and
vile
holding
no
quantity
love
can
transpose
to
form
and
dignity
love
looks
not
with
the
eyes
but
with
the
mind
and
therefore
is
wingd
cupid
painted
blind
nor
hath
loves
mind
of
any
judgment
taste
wings
and
no
eyes
figure
unheedy
haste
and
therefore
is
love
said
to
be
a
child
because
in
choice
he
is
so
oft
beguild
as
waggish
boys
in
game
themselves
forswear
so
the
boy
love
is
perjurd
every
where
for
ere
demetrius
lookd
on
hermias
eyne
he
haild
down
oaths
that
he
was
only
mine
and
when
this
hail
some
heat
from
hermia
felt
so
he
dissolvd
and
showers
of
oaths
did
melt
i
will
go
tell
him
of
fair
hermias
flight
then
to
the
wood
will
he
tomorrow
night
pursue
her
and
for
this
intelligence
if
i
have
thanks
it
is
a
dear
expense
but
herein
mean
i
to
enrich
my
pain
to
have
his
sight
thither
and
back
again
is
all
our
company
here
you
were
best
to
call
them
generally
man
by
man
according
to
the
scrip
here
is
the
scroll
of
every
mans
name
which
is
thought

audience
look
to
their
eyes

devices
known
in
the
meantime
i
will
draw
a
bill
of
properties
such
as
our
play
wants
i
pray
you
fail
me
not
we
will
meet
and
there
we
may
rehearse
more
obscenely
and
courageously
take
pains
be
perfect
adieu
at
the
dukes
oak
we
meet
enough
hold
or
cut
bowstrings
how
now
spirit
whither
wander
you
over
hill
over
dale
thorough
bush
thorough
brier
over
park
over
pale
thorough
flood
thorough
fire
i
do
wander
every
where
swifter
than
the
moones
sphere
and
i
serve
the
fairy
queen
to
dew
her
orbs
upon
the
green
the
cowslips
tall
her
pensioners
be
in
their
gold
coats
spots
you
see
those
be
rubies
fairy
favours
in
their
freckles
live
their
savours
i
must
go
seek
some
dewdrops
here
and
hang
a
pearl
in
every
cowslips
ear
farewell
thou
lob
of
spirits
ill
be
gone
our
queen
and
all
her
elves
come
here
anon
the
king
doth
keep
his
revels
here
tonight
take
heed
the
queen
come
not
within
his
sight
for
oberon
is
passing
fell
and
wrath
because
that
she
as
her
attendant
hath
a
lovely
boy
stoln
from
an
indian
king
she
never
had
so
sweet
a
changeling
and
jealous
oberon
would
have
the
child
knight
of
his
train
to
trace
the
forests
wild
but
she
perforce
withholds
the
loved
boy
crowns
him
with
flowers
and
makes
him
all
her
joy
and
now
they
never
meet
in
grove
or
green
by
fountain
clear
or
spangled
starlight
sheen
but
they
do
square
that
all
their
elves
for
fear
creep
into
acorncups
and
hide
them
there
either
i
mistake
your
shape
and
making
quite
or
else
you
are
that
shrewd
and
knavish
sprite
calld
robin
goodfellow
are
you
not
he
that
frights
the
maidens
of
the
villagery
skim
milk
and
sometimes
labour
in
the
quern
and
bootless
make
the
breathless
housewife
churn
and
sometime
make
the
drink
to
bear
no
barm
mislead
nightwanderers
laughing
at
their
harm
those
that
hobgoblin
call
you
and
sweet
puck
you
do
their
work
and
they
shall
have
good
luck
are
you
not
he
fairy
thou
speakst
aright
i
am
that
merry
wanderer
of
the
night
i
jest
to
oberon
and
make
him
smile
when
i
a
fat
and
beanfed
horse
beguile
neighing
in
likeness
of
a
filly
foal
and
sometime
lurk
i
in
a
gossips
bowl
in
very
likeness
of
a
roasted
crab
and
when
she
drinks
against
her
lips
i
bob
and
on
her
witherd
dewlap
pour
the
ale
the
wisest
aunt
telling
the
saddest
tale
sometime
for
threefoot
stool
mistaketh
me
then
slip
i
from
her
bum
down
topples
she
and
tailor
cries
and
falls
into
a
cough
and
then
the
whole
quire
hold
their
hips
and
loff
and
waxen
in
their
mirth
and
neeze
and
swear
a
merrier
hour
was
never
wasted
there
but
room
fairy
here
comes
oberon
and
here
my
mistress
would
that
he
were
gone
ill
met
by
moonlight
proud
titania
what
jealous
oberon
fairies
skip
hence
i
have
forsworn
his
bed
and
company
tarry
rash
wanton
am
not
i
thy
lord
then
i
must
be
thy
lady
but
i
know
when
thou
hast
stoln
away
from
fairy
land
and
in
the
shape
of
corin
sat
all
day
playing
on
pipes
of
corn
and
versing
love
to
amorous
phillida
why
art
thou
here
come
from
the
furthest
steppe
of
india
but
that
forsooth
the
bouncing
amazon
your
buskind
mistress
and
your
warrior
love
to
theseus
must
be
wedded
and
you
come
to
give
their
bed
joy
and
prosperity
how
canst
thou
thus
for
shame
titania
glance
at
my
credit
with
hippolyta
knowing
i
know
thy
love
to
theseus
didst
thou
not
lead
him
through
the
glimmering
night
from
perigouna
whom
he
ravished
and
make
him
with
fair
gle
break
his
faith
with
ariadne
and
antiopa
these
are
the
forgeries
of
jealousy
and
never
since
the
middle
summers
spring
met
we
on
hill
in
dale
forest
or
mead
by
paved
fountain
or
by
rushy
brook
or
in
the
beached
margent
of
the
sea
to
dance
our
ringlets
to
the
whistling
wind
but
with
thy
brawls
thou
hast
disturbd
our
sport
therefore
the
winds
piping
to
us
in
vain
as
in
revenge
have
suckd
up
from
the
sea
contagious
fogs
which
falling
in
the
land
have
every
pelting
river
made
so
proud
that
they
have
overborne
their
continents
the
ox
hath
therefore
stretchd
his
yoke
in
vain
the
ploughman
lost
his
sweat
and
the
green
corn
hath
rotted
ere
his
youth
attaind
a
beard
the
fold
stands
empty
in
the
drowned
field
and
crows
are
fatted
with
the
murrion
flock
the
nine
mens
morris
is
filld
up
with
mud
and
the
quaint
mazes
in
the
wanton
green
for
lack
of
tread
are
undistinguishable
the
human
mortals
want
their
winter
here
no
night
is
now
with
hymn
or
carol
blest
therefore
the
moon
the
governess
of
floods
pale
in
her
anger
washes
all
the
air
that
rheumatic
diseases
do
abound
and
thorough
this
distemperature
we
see
the
seasons
alter
hoaryheaded
frosts
fall
in
the
fresh
lap
of
the
crimson
rose
and
on
old
hiems
thin
and
icy
crown
an
odorous
chaplet
of
sweet
summer
buds
is
as
in
mockery
set
the
spring
the
summer
the
childing
autumn
angry
winter
change
their
wonted
liveries
and
the
mazed
world
by
their
increase
now
knows
not
which
is
which
and
this
same
progeny
of
evil
comes
from
our
debate
from
our
dissension
we
are
their
parents
and
original
do
you
amend
it
then
it
lies
in
you
why
should
titania
cross
her
oberon
i
do
but
beg
a
little
changeling
boy
to
be
my
henchman
set
your
heart
at
rest
the
fairy
land
buys
not
the
child
of
me
his
mother
was
a
votaress
of
my
order
and
in
the
spiced
indian
air
by
night
full
often
hath
she
gossipd
by
my
side
and
sat
with
me
on
neptunes
yellow
sands
marking
the
embarked
traders
on
the
flood
when
we
have
laughd
to
see
the
sails
conceive
and
grow
bigbellied
with
the
wanton
wind
which
she
with
pretty
and
with
swimming
gait
following
her
womb
then
rich
with
my
young
squire
would
imitate
and
sail
upon
the
land
to
fetch
me
trifles
and
return
again
as
from
a
voyage
rich
with
merchandise
but
she
being
mortal
of
that
boy
did
die
and
for
her
sake
i
do
rear
up
her
boy
and
for
her
sake
i
will
not
part
with
him
how
long
within
this
wood
intend
you
stay
perchance
till
after
theseus
weddingday
if
you
will
patiently
dance
in
our
round
and
see
our
moonlight
revels
go
with
us
if
not
shun
me
and
i
will
spare
your
haunts
give
me
that
boy
and
i
will
go
with
thee
not
for
thy
fairy
kingdom
fairies
away
we
shall
chide
downright
if
i
longer
stay
well
go
thy
way
thou
shalt
not
from
this
grove
till
i
torment
thee
for
this
injury
my
gentle
puck
come
hither
thou
rememberst
since
once
i
sat
upon
a
promontory
and
heard
a
mermaid
on
a
dolphins
back
uttering
such
dulcet
and
harmonious
breath
that
the
rude
sea
grew
civil
at
her
song
and
certain
stars
shot
madly
from
their
spheres
to
hear
the
seamaids
music
i
remember
that
very
time
i
saw
but
thou
couldst
not
flying
between
the
cold
moon
and
the
earth

all
armd
a
certain
aim
he
took
at
a
fair
vestal
throned
by
the
west
and
loosd
his
loveshaft
smartly
from
his
bow
as
it
should
pierce
a
hundred
thousand
hearts
but
i
might
see
young
cupids
fiery
shaft
quenchd
in
the
chaste
beams
of
the
watry
moon
and
the
imperial
votaress
passed
on
in
maiden
meditation
fancyfree
yet
markd
i
where
the
bolt
of
cupid
fell
it
fell
upon
a
little
western
flower

purple
with
loves

and
maidens

me
that
flower

upon
the
next
live
creature

herb

the
earth
in
forty
minutes
having
once
this
juice
ill
watch
titania
when
she
is
asleep
and
drop
the
liquor
of
it
in
her
eyes

next
thing

looks
upon
be
it
on
lion
bear
or
wolf
or
bull
on
meddling
monkey
or
on
busy
ape
she
shall
pursue
it
with
the
soul
of
love
and
ere

take
this
charm
off
from
her
sight
as
i
can
take
it
with
another
herb
ill
make
her
render
up
her
page
to
me
but
who
comes
here
i
am
invisible
and
i
will
overhear
their
conference
i
love
thee
not
therefore
pursue
me
not
where

and
fair
hermia
the

thou
toldst
me
they

stoln
into
this
wood
and

this
wood
because
i
cannot
meet
my
hermia
hence
get
thee
gone
and
follow
me
no
more
you
draw
me
you
hardhearted
adamant
but
yet
you
draw
not
iron
for
my
heart
is
true
as
steel
leave
you
your
power
to
draw
and
i
shall
have
no
power
to
follow
you
do
i
entice
you
do
i
speak
you
fair
or
rather
do
i
not
in
plainest
truth
tell
you
i
do
not
nor
i
cannot
love
you
and
even
for
that
do
i
love
you
the
more
i
am
your
spaniel
and
demetrius
the
more
you

me
i
will
fawn
on
you
use
me
but
as
your
spaniel
spurn
me
strike
me
neglect
me
lose
me
only
give
me
leave
unworthy
as
i
am
to
follow
you
what
worser
place
can
i
beg
in
your
love
and
yet
a
place
of
high
respect
with
me
than
to
be
used
as
you
use
your
dog
tempt
not
too
much
the
hatred
of
my
spirit
for
i
am
sick
when
i
do
look
on
you
and
i
am
sick
when
i
look
not
on
you
you
do
impeach
your
modesty
too
much
to
leave
the
city
and
commit
yourself
into
the
hands
of
one
that
loves
you
not
to
trust
the
opportunity
of
night
and
the
ill
counsel
of
a
desert
place
with
the
rich
worth
of
your
virginity
your
virtue
is
my
privilege
for
that
it
is
not
night
when
i
do
see
your
face
therefore
i
think
i
am
not
in
the
night
nor
doth
this
wood
lack
worlds
of
company
for
you
in
my
respect
are
all
the
world
then
how
can
it
be
said
i
am
alone
when
all
the
world
is
here
to
look
on
me
ill
run
from
thee
and
hide
me
in
the
brakes
and
leave
thee
to
the
mercy
of
wild
beasts
the
wildest
hath
not
such
a
heart
as
you
run
when
you
will
the
story
shall
be
changd
apollo
flies
and
daphne
holds
the
chase
the
dove
pursues
the
griffin
the
mild
hind
makes
speed
to
catch
the
tiger
bootless
speed
when
cowardice
pursues
and
valour
flies
i
will
not
stay
thy
questions
let
me
go
or
if
thou
follow
me
do
not
believe
but
i
shall
do
thee
mischief
in
the
wood
ay
in
the
temple
in
the
town
the

mischief
fie
demetrius
your
wrongs

may
do
we
should
be

and
were
not
made
to

the
flower
there
welcome
wanderer
ay
there
it
is
i
pray
thee
give
it
me
i
know
a
bank
whereon
the
wild
thyme
blows
where
oxlips
and
the
nodding
violet
grows
quite
overcanopied
with
luscious
woodbine
with
sweet
muskroses
and
with
eglantine
there
sleeps
titania
some
time
of
the
night
lulld
in
these
flowers
with
dances
and
delight
and
there
the
snake
throws
her
enamelld
skin
weed
wide
enough
to
wrap
a
fairy
in
and
with
the
juice
of
this
ill
streak
her
eyes
and
make
her
full
of
hateful
fantasies
take
thou
some
of
it
and
seek
through
this
grove
a
sweet
athenian
lady
is
in
love
with
a
disdainful
youth
anoint
his
eyes
but
do
it
when
the
next
thing
he
espies
may
be
the
lady
thou
shalt
know
the
man
by
the
athenian
garments
he
hath
on
effect
it
with
some
care
that
he
may
prove
more
fond
on
her
than
she
upon
her
love
and
look

meet
me
ere
the
first
cock
crow
fear
not
my
lord
your
servant
shall
do
so

and
a
fairy
song
then
for
the
third
of
a
minute
hence

to
kill
cankers
in
the
muskrose
buds
some
war
with
reremice
for
their
leathern
wings
to
make
my
small
elves
coats
and
some
keep
back
the
clamorous
owl
that
nightly
hoots
and
wonders
at
our
quaint
spirits

is
knit
so
that
but
one
heart
we
can
make
of

two
bosoms
interchained
with

this
is
he
my
master
said
despised
the
athenian
maid
and
here
the
maiden
sleeping
sound
on
the
dank
and
dirty
ground
pretty
soul
she
durst
not
lie
near
this
lacklove
this
killcourtesy
churl
upon
thy
eyes
i
throw
all
the
power
this
charm
doth
owe
when
thou
wakst
let
love
forbid
sleep
his
seat
on
thy
eyelid
so
awake
when
i
am
gone
for
i
must
now
to
oberon
stay
though
thou
kill
me
sweet
demetrius
i
charge
thee
hence
and
do
not
haunt
me
thus
o
wilt
thou
darkling
leave
me
do
not
so
stay
on
thy
peril
i
alone
will
go
o
i
am
out
of
breath
in
this
fond
chase
the
more
my
prayer
the
lesser
is
my
grace
happy
is
hermia
wheresoeer
she
lies
for
she
hath
blessed
and
attractive
eyes
how
came
her
eyes
so
bright
not
with
salt
tears
if
so
my
eyes
are
oftener
washd
than
hers
no
no
i
am
as
ugly
as
a
bear
for
beasts
that
meet
me
run
away
for
fear
therefore
no
marvel
though
demetrius
do
as
a
monster
fly
my
presence
thus
what
wicked
and
dissembling
glass
of
mine
made
me
compare
with
hermias
sphery
eyne
but
who
is
here
lysander
on
the
ground
dead
or
asleep
i
see
no
blood
no
wound
lysander
if
you
live
good
sir
awake
and
run
through
fire
i
will
for
thy
sweet
sake
transparent
helena
nature
shows
art
that
through
thy
bosom
makes
me
see
thy
heart
where
is
demetrius
o
how
fit
a
word
is
that
vile
name
to
perish
on
my
sword
do
not
say
so
lysander
say
not
so
what
though
he
love
your
hermia
lord
what
though
yet
hermia
still
loves
you
then
be
content
content
with
hermia
no
i
do
repent
the
tedious
minutes
i
with
her
have
spent
not
hermia
but
helena
i
love
who
will
not
change
a
raven
for
a
dove
the
will
of
man
is
by
his
reason
swayd
and
reason
says
you
are
the
worthier
maid
things
growing
are
not
ripe
until
their
season
so
i
being
young
till
now
ripe
not
to
reason
and
touching
now
the
point
of
human
skill
reason
becomes
the
marshal
to
my
will
and
leads
me
to
your
eyes
where
i
oerlook
loves
stories
written
in
loves
richest
book
wherefore
was
i
to
this
keen
mockery
born
when
at
your
hands
did
i
deserve
this
scorn
ist
not
enough
ist
not
enough
young
man
that
i
did
never
no
nor
never
can
deserve
a
sweet
look
from
demetrius
eye
but
you
must
flout
my
insufficiency
good
troth
you
do
me
wrong
good
sooth
you
do
in
such
disdainful
manner
me
to
woo
but
fare
you
well
perforce
i
must
confess
i
thought
you
lord
of
more
true
gentleness
o
that
a
lady
of
one
man
refusd
should
of
another
therefore
be
abusd
she
sees
not
hermia
hermia
sleep
thou
there
and
never
mayst
thou
come
lysander
near
for
as
a
surfeit
of
the
sweetest
things
the
deepest
loathing
to
the
stomach
brings
or
as
the
heresies
that
men
do
leave
are
hated
most
of
those
they
did
deceive
so
thou
my
surfeit
and
my
heresy
of
all
be
hated
but
the
most
of
me
and
all
my
powers
address
your
love
and
might
to
honour
helen
and
to
be
her
knight
help
me
lysander
help
me
do
thy
best
to
pluck
this
crawling
serpent
from
my
breast
ay
me
for
pity
what
a
dream
was
here
lysander
look
how
i
do
quake
with
fear
methought
a
serpent
eat
my
heart
away
and
you
sat
smiling
at
his
cruel
prey
lysander
what
removd
lysander
lord
what
out
of
hearing
gone
no
sound
no
word
alack
where
are
you
speak
an
if
you
hear
speak
of
all
loves
i
swound
almost
with
fear
no
then
i
well
perceive
you
are
not
nigh
either
death
or
you
ill
find
immediately
are
we
all
met
pat
pat
and
heres
a
marvellous
convenient
place
for
our
rehearsal
this
green
plot
shall
be
our
stage
this
hawthornbrake
our
tiringhouse
and
we
will
do
it
in
action
as
we
will
do
it
before
the
duke
peter
quince
what
sayst
thou
bully
bottom
there
are
things
in
this
comedy
of
pyramus
and
thisby
that
will
never
please
first
pyramus
must
draw
a
sword
to
kill
himself
which
the
ladies
cannot
abide
how
answer
you
that
byr
lakin
a
parlous
fear
i
believe
we
must
leave
the
killing
out
when
all
is
done
not
a
whit
i
have
a
device
to
make
all
well
write
me
a
prologue
and
let
the
prologue
seem
to
say
we
will
do
no
harm
with
our
swords
and
that
pyramus
is
not
killed
indeed
and
for
the
more
better
assurance
tell
them
that
i
pyramus
am
not
pyramus
but
bottom
the
weaver
this
will
put
them
out
of
fear
well
we
will
have
such
a
prologue
and
it
shall
be
written
in
eight
and
six
no
make
it
two
more
let
it
be
written
in
eight
and
eight
will
not
the
ladies
be
afeard
of
the
lion
i
fear
it
i
promise
you
masters
you
ought
to
consider
with
yourselves
to
bring
in
god
shield
us
a
lion
among
ladies
is
a
most
dreadful
thing
for
there
is
not
a
more
fearful
wildfowl
than
your
lion
living
and
we
ought
to
look
to
it
therefore
another
prologue
must
tell
he
is
not
a
lion
nay
you
must
name
his
name
and
half
his
face
must
be
seen
through
the
lions
neck
and
he
himself
must
speak
through
saying
thus
or
to
the
same
defect
ladies
or
fair
ladies
i
would
wish
you
or
i
would
request
you
or
i
would
entreat
you
not
to
fear
not
to
tremble
my
life
for
yours
if
you
think
i
come
hither
as
a
lion
it
were
pity
of
my
life
no
i
am
no
such
thing
i
am
a
man
as
other
men
are
and
there
indeed
let
him
name
his
name
and
tell
them
plainly
he
is
snug
the
joiner
well
it
shall
be
so
but
there
is
two
hard
things
that
is
to
bring
the
moonlight
into
a
chamber
for
you
know
pyramus
and
thisby
meet
by
moonlight
doth
the
moon
shine
that
night
we
play
our
play
a
calendar
a
calendar
look
in
the
almanack
find
out
moonshine
find
out
moonshine
yes
it
doth
shine
that
night
why
then
may
you
leave
a
casement
of
the
great
chamberwindow
where
we
play
open
and
the
moon
may
shine
in
at
the
casement
ay
or
else
one
must
come
in
with
a
bush
of
thorns
and
a
lanthorn
and
say
he
comes
to
disfigure
or
to
present
the
person
of
moonshine
then
there
is
another
thing
we
must
have
a
wall
in
the
great
chamber
for
pyramus
and
thisby
says
the
story
did
talk
through
the
chink
of
a
wall
you
can
never
bring
in
a
wall
what
say
you
bottom
some
man
or
other
must
present
wall
and
let
him
have
some
plaster
or
some
loam
or
some
roughcast
about
him
to
signify
wall
and
let
him
hold
his
fingers
thus
and
through
that
cranny
shall
pyramus
and
thisby
whisper
if
that
may
be
than
all
is
well
come
sit
down
every
mothers
son
and
rehearse
your
parts

from
my
flowery

the
sparrow
and
the
lark
the
plainsong
cuckoo
gray
whose
note
full
many
a

doth
mark

answer
nay
for
indeed
who

virtues
force
perforce
doth
move
me
on
the
first
view
to

to
swear
i
love
thee
methinks

you
should
have
little
reason
for
that
and

to
say

truth

can
gleek
upon
occasion
thou
art

wise
as
thou

watery
eye
and
when

every
little
flower
lamenting
some
enforced
chastity
tie
up
my
loves
tongue
bring
him
silently
i
wonder
if
titania
be
awakd
then
what
it
was
that
next
came
in
her
eye
which
she
must
dote
on
in
extremity
here
comes
my
messenger
how
now
mad
spirit
what
nightrule
now
about
this
haunted
grove
my
mistress
with
a
monster
is
in
love
near
to
her
close
and
consecrated
bower
while
she
was
in
her
dull
and
sleeping
hour
a
crew
of
patches
rude
mechanicals
that
work
for
bread
upon
athenian
stalls
were
met
together
to
rehearse
a
play
intended
for
great
theseus
nuptial
day
the
shallowest
thickskin
of
that
barren
sort
who
pyramus
presented
in
their
sport
forsook
his
scene
and
enterd
in
a
brake
when
i
did
him
at
this
advantage
take
an
asss
nowl
i
fixed
on
his
head
anon
his
thisbe
must
be
answered
and
forth
my
mimick
comes
when
they
him
spy
as
wild
geese
that
the
creeping
fowler
eye
or
russetpated
choughs
many
in
sort
rising
and
cawing
at
the
guns
report
sever
themselves
and
madly
sweep
the
sky
so
at
his
sight
away
his
fellows
fly
and
at
our
stamp
here
oer
and
oer
one
falls
he
murder
cries
and
help
from
athens
calls
their
sense
thus
weak
lost
with
their
fears
thus
strong
made
senseless
things
begin
to
do
them
wrong
for
briers
and
thorns
at
their
apparel
snatch
some
sleeves
some
hats
from
yielders
all
things
catch
i
led
them
on
in
this
distracted
fear
and
left
sweet
pyramus
translated
there
when
in
that
moment
so
it
came
to
pass
titania
wakd
and
straightway
lovd
an
ass
this
falls
out
better
than
i
could
devise
but
hast
thou
yet
latchd
the
athenians
eyes
with
the
lovejuice
as
i
did
bid
thee
do
i
took
him
sleeping
that
is
finishd
too
and
the
athenian
woman
by
his
side
that
when
he
wakd
of
force
she
must
be
eyd
stand
close
this
is
the
same
athenian
this
is
the
woman
but
not
this
the
man
o
why
rebuke
you
him
that
loves
you
so
lay
breath
so
bitter
on
your
bitter
foe
now
i
but
chide
but
i
should
use
thee
worse
for
thou
i
fear
hast
given
me
cause
to
curse
if
thou
hast
slain
lysander
in
his
sleep
being
oer
shoes
in
blood
plunge
in
knee
deep
and
kill
me
too
the
sun
was
not
so
true
unto
the
day
as
he
to
me
would
he
have
stoln
away
from
sleeping
hermia
ill
believe
as
soon
this
whole
earth
may
be
bord
and
that
the
moon
may
through
the
centre
creep
and
so
displease
her
brothers
noontide
with
the
antipodes
it
cannot
be
but
thou
hast
murderd
him
so
should
a
murderer
look
so
dead
so
grim
so
should
the
murderd
look
and
so
should
i
piercd
through
the
heart
with
your
stern
cruelty
yet
you
the
murderer
look
as
bright
as
clear
as
yonder
venus
in
her
glimmering
sphere
whats
this
to
my
lysander
where
is
he
ah
good
demetrius
wilt
thou
give
him
me
i
had
rather
give
his
carcass
to
my
hounds
out

captain

pleading
for
a
lovers

shall
we
their
fond
pageant
see
lord
what
fools
these
mortals
be
stand
aside
the
noise
they
make
will
cause
demetrius
to
awake
then
will
two
at
once
woo
one
that
must
needs
be
sport
alone
and
those
things
do
best
please
me
that
befall
preposterously
why
should
you
think
that
i
should
woo
in
scorn
scorn
and
derision
never
come
in
tears
look
when
i
vow
i
weep
and
vows
so
born
in
their
nativity
all
truth
appears
how
can
these
things
in
me
seem
scorn
to
you
bearing
the
badge
of
faith
to
prove
them
true
you
do
advance
your
cunning
more
and
more
when
truth
kills
truth
o
devilishholy
fray
these
vows
are
hermias
will
you
give
her
oer
weigh
oath
with
oath
and
you
will
nothing
weigh
your
vows
to
her
and
me
put
in
two
scales
will
even
weigh
and
both
as
light
as
tales
i
had
no
judgment
when
to
her
i
swore
nor
none
in
my
mind
now
you
give
her
oer
demetrius
loves
her
and
he
loves
not
you
o
helen
goddess
nymph
perfect
divine
to
what
my
love
shall
i
compare
thine
eyne
crystal
is
muddy
o
how
ripe
in
show
thy
lips
those
kissing
cherries
tempting
grow
this
pure
congealed
white
high
taurus
snow
fannd
with
the
eastern
wind
turns
to
a
crow
when
thou
holdst
up
thy
hand
o
let
me
kiss
that
princess
of
pure
white
this
seal
of
bliss
o
spite
o
hell
i
see
you
all
are
bent
to
set
against
me
for
your
merriment
if
you
were
civil
and
knew
courtesy
you
would
not
do
me
thus
much
injury
can
you
not
hate
me
as
i
know
you
do
but
you
must
join
in
souls
to
mock
me
too
if
you
were
men
as
men
you
are
in
show
you
would
not
use
a
gentle
lady
so
to
vow
and
swear
and
superpraise
my
parts
when
i
am
sure
you
hate
me
with
your
hearts
you
both
are
rivals
and
love
hermia
and
now
both
rivals
to
mock
helena
a
trim
exploit
a
manly
enterprise
to
conjure
tears
up
in
a
poor
maids
eyes
with
your
derision
none
of
noble
sort
would
so
offend
a
virgin
and
extort
a
poor
souls
patience
all
to
make
you
sport
you
are
unkind
demetrius
be
not
so
for
you
love
hermia
this
you
know
i
know
and
here
with
all
good
will
with
all
my
heart
in
hermias
love
i
yield
you
up
my
part
and
yours
of
helena
to
me
bequeath
whom
i
do
love
and
will
do
to
my
death
never
did
mockers
waste
more
idle
breath
lysander
keep
thy
hermia
i
will
none
if
eer
i
lovd
her
all
that
love
is
gone
my
heart
with
her
but
as
guest
wise
sojournd
and
now
to
helen
it
is
home
returnd
there
to
remain
helen
it
is
not
so
disparage
not
the
faith
thou
dost
not
know
lest
to
thy
peril
thou
aby
it
dear
look
where
thy
love
comes
yonder
is
thy
dear
dark
night
that
from
the
eye
his
function
takes
the
ear
more
quick
of
apprehension
makes
wherein
it
doth
impair
the
seeing
sense
it
pays
the
hearing
double
recompense
thou
art
not
by
mine
eye
lysander
found
mine
ear
i
thank
it
brought
me
to
thy
sound
but
why
unkindly
didst
thou
leave
me
so
why
should
he
stay
whom
love
doth
press
to
go
what
love
could
press
lysander
from
my
side
lysanders
love
that
would
not
let
him
bide
fair
helena
who
more
engilds
the
night
than
all
yon
fiery
oes
and
eyes
of
light
why
seekst
thou
me
could
not
this
make
thee
know
the
hate
i
bear
thee
made
me
leave
thee
so
you
speak
not
as
you
think
it
cannot
be
lo
she
is
one
of
this
confederacy
now
i
perceive
they
have
conjoind
all
three
to
fashion
this
false
sport
in
spite
of
me
injurious
hermia
most
ungrateful
maid
have
you
conspird
have
you
with
these
contrivd
to
bait
me
with
this
foul
derision
is
all
the
counsel
that
we
two
have
shard
the
sistervows
the
hours
that
we
have
spent
when
we
have
chid
the
hastyfooted
time
for
parting
us
o
is
it
all
forgot
all
schooldays
friendship
childhood
innocence
we
hermia
like
two
artificial
gods
have
with
our
neelds
created
both
one
flower
both
on
one
sampler
sitting
on
one
cushion
both
warbling
of
one
song
both
in
one
key
as
if
our
hands
our
sides
voices
and
minds
had
been
incorporate
so
we
grew
together
like
to
a
double
cherry
seeming
parted
but
yet
an
union
in
partition
two
lovely
berries
moulded
on
one
stem
so
with
two
seeming
bodies
but
one
heart
two
of
the
first
like
coats
in
heraldry
due
but
to
one
and
crowned
with
one
crest
and
will
you
rent
our
ancient
love
asunder
to
join
with
men
in
scorning
your
poor
friend
it
is
not
friendly
tis
not
maidenly
our
sex
as
well
as
i
may
chide
you
for
it
though
i
alone
do
feel
the
injury
i
am
amazed
at
your
passionate
words
i
scorn
you
not
it
seems
that
you
scorn
me
have
you
not
set
lysander
as
in
scorn
to
follow
me
and
praise
my
eyes
and
face
and
made
your
other
love
demetrius
who
even
but
now
did
spurn
me
with
his
foot
to
call
me
goddess
nymph
divine
and
rare
precious
celestial
wherefore
speaks
he
this
to
her
he
hates
and
wherefore
doth
lysander
deny
your
love
so
rich
within
his
soul
and
tender
me
forsooth
affection
but
by
your
setting
on
by
your
consent
what
though
i
be
not
so
in
grace
as
you
so
hung
upon
with
love
so
fortunate
but
miserable
most
to
love
unlovd
this
you
should
pity
rather
than
despise
i
understand
not
what
you
mean
by
this
ay
do
persever
counterfeit
sad
looks
make
mouths
upon
me
when
i
turn
my
back
wink
each
at
other
hold
the
sweet
jest
up
this
sport
well
carried
shall
be
chronicled
if
you
have
any
pity
grace
or
manners
you
would
not
make
me
such
an
argument
but
fare
ye
well
tis
partly
mine
own
fault
which
death
or
absence
soon
shall
remedy
stay
gentle
helena
hear
my
excuse
my
love
my
life
my
soul
fair
helena
o
excellent
sweet
do
not
scorn
her
so
if
she
cannot
entreat
i
can
compel
thou
canst
compel
no
more
than
she
entreat
thy
threats
have
no
more
strength
than
her
weak
prayers
helen
i
love
thee
by
my
life
i
do
i
swear
by
that
which
i
will
lose
for
thee
to
prove
him
false
that
says
i
love
thee
not
i
say
i
love
thee
more
than
he
can
do
if
thou
say
so
withdraw
and
prove
it
too
quick
come
lysander
whereto
tends
all
this
away
you
ethiop
no
no
hell
seem
to
break
loose
take
on
as
you
would
follow
but
yet
come
not
you
are
a
tame
man
go
hang
off
thou
cat
thou
burr
vile
thing
let
loose
or
i
will
shake
thee
from
me
like
a
serpent
why
are
you
grown
so
rude
what
change
is
this
sweet
love
thy
love
out
tawny
tartar
out
out
loathed
medicine
hated
poison
hence
do
you
not
jest
yes
sooth
and
so
do
you
demetrius
i
will
keep
my
word
with
thee
i
would
i
had
your
bond
for
i
perceive
a
weak
bond
holds
you
ill
not
trust
your
word
what
should
i
hurt
her
strike
her
kill
her
dead
although
i
hate
her
ill
not
harm
her
so
what
can
you
do
me
greater
harm
than
hate
hate
me
wherefore
o
me
what
news
my
love
am
not
i
hermia
are
not
you
lysander
i
am
as
fair
now
as
i
was
erewhile
since
night
you
lovd
me
yet
since
night
you
left
me
why
then
you
left
me
o
the
gods
forbid
in
earnest
shall
i
say
ay
by
my
life
and
never
did
desire
to
see
thee
more
therefore
be
out
of
hope
of
question
doubt
be
certain
nothing
truer
tis
no
jest
that
i
do
hate
thee
and
love
helena
o
me
you
juggler
you
cankerblossom
you
thief
of
love
what
have
you
come
by
night
and
stoln
my
loves
heart
from
him
fine
i
faith
have
you
no
modesty
no
maiden
shame
no
touch
of
bashfulness
what
will
you
tear
impatient
answers
from
my
gentle
tongue
fie
fie
you
counterfeit
you
puppet
you
puppet
why
so
ay
that
way
goes
the
game
now
i
perceive
that
she
hath
made
compare
between
our
statures
she
hath
urgd
her
height
and
with
her
personage
her
tall
personage
her
height
forsooth
she
hath
prevaild
with
him
and
are
you
grown
so
high
in
his
esteem
because
i
am
so
dwarfish
and
so
low
how
low
am
i
thou
painted
maypole
speak
how
low
am
i
i
am
not
yet
so
low
but
that
my
nails
can
reach
unto
thine
eyes
i
pray
you
though
you
mock
me
gentlemen
let
her
not
hurt
me
i
was
never
curst
i
have
no
gift
at
all
in
shrewishness
i
am
a
right
maid
for
my
cowardice
let
her
not
strike
me
you
perhaps
may
think
because
she
is
something
lower
than
myself
that
i
can
match
her
lower
hark
again
good
hermia
do
not
be
so
bitter
with
me
i
evermore
did
love
you
hermia
did
ever
keep
your
counsels
never
wrongd
you
save
that
in
love
unto
demetrius
i
told
him
of
your
stealth
unto
this
wood
he
followd
you
for
love
i
followd
him
but
he
hath
chid
me
hence
and
threatend
me
to
strike
me
spurn
me
nay
to
kill
me
too
and
now
so
you
will
let
me
quiet
go
to
athens
will
i
bear
my
folly
back
and
follow
you
no
further
let
me
go
you
see
how
simple
and
how
fond
i
am
why
get
you
gone
who
ist
that
hinders
you
a
foolish
heart
that
i
leave
here
behind
what
with
lysander
with
demetrius
be
not
afraid
she
shall
not
harm
thee
helena
no
sir
she
shall
not
though
you
take
her
part
o
when
shes
angry
she
is
keen
and
shrewd
she
was
a
vixen
when
she
went
to
school
and
though
she
be
but
little
she
is
fierce
little
again
nothing
but
low
and
little
why
will
you
suffer
her
to
flout
me
thus
let
me
come
to
her
get
you
gone
you
dwarf
you
minimus
of
hindering
knotgrass
made
you
bead
you
acorn
you
are
too
officious
in
her
behalf
that
scorns
your
services
let
her
alone
speak
not
of
helena
take
not
her
part
for
if
thou
dost
intend
never
so
little
show
of
love
to
her
thou
shalt
aby
it
now
she
holds
me
not
now
follow
if
thou
darst
to
try
whose
right
or
thine
or
mine
is
most
in
helena
follow
nay
ill
go
with
thee
cheek
by
jole
you
mistress
all
this
coil
is
long
of
you
nay
go
not
back
i
will
not
trust
you
i
nor
longer
stay
in
your
curst
company
your
hands
than
mine
are
quicker
for
a
fray
my
legs
are
longer
though
to
run
away
i
am
amazd
and
know
not
what
to
say
this
is
thy
negligence
still
thou
mistakst
or
else
commitst
thy
knaveries
wilfully
believe
me
king
of
shadows
i
mistook
did
not
you
tell
me
i
should
know
the
man
by
the
athenian
garments
he
had
on
and
so
far
blameless
proves
my
enterprise
that
i
have
nointed
an
athenians
eyes
and
so
far
am
i
glad
it
so
did
sort
as
this
their
jangling
i
esteem
a
sport
thou
seest
these
lovers
seek
a
place
to
fight
hie
therefore
robin
overcast
the
night
the
starry
welking
cover
thou
anon
with
drooping
fog
as
black
as
acheron
and
lead
these
testy
rivals
so
astray
as
one
come
not
within
anothers
way
like
to
lysander
sometime
frame
thy
tongue
then
stir
demetrius
up
with
bitter
wrong
and
sometime
rail
thou
like
demetrius
and
from
each
other
look
thou
lead
them
thus
till
oer
their
brows
deathcounterfeiting
sleep
with
leaden
legs
and
batty
wings
doth
creep
then
crush
this
herb
into
lysanders
eye
whose
liquor
hath
this
virtuous
property
to
take
from
thence
all
error
with
his
might
and
make
his
eyeballs
roll
with
wonted
sight
when
they
next
wake
all
this
derision
shall
seem
a
dream
and
fruitless
vision
and
back
to
athens
shall
the
lovers
wend
with
league
whose
date
till
death
shall
never
end
whiles
i
in
this
affair
do
thee
employ
ill
to
my
queen
and
beg
her
indian
boy
and
then
i
will
her
charmed
eye
release
from
monsters
view
and
all
things
shall
be
peace
my
fairy
lord
this
must
be
done
with
haste
for
nights
swift
dragons
cut
the
clouds
full
fast
and
yonder
shines
auroras
harbinger
at
whose
approach
ghosts
wandering
here
and
there
troop
home
to
churchyards
damned
spirits
all
that
in
crossways
and
floods
have
burial
already
to
their
wormy
beds
are
gone
for
fear
lest
day
should
look
their
shames
upon
they
wilfully
themselves
exile
from
light
and
must
for
aye
consort
with
blackbrowd
night
but
we
are
spirits
of
another
sort
i
with
the
mornings
love
have
oft
made
sport
and
like
a
forester
the
groves
may
tread
even
till
the
eastern
gate
all
fieryred
opening
on
neptune
with
fair
blessed
beams
turns
into
yellow
gold
his
salt
greenstreams
but
notwithstanding
haste
make
no
delay
we
may
effect
this
business
yet
ere
day
up
and
down
up
and
down
i
will
lead
them
up
and
down
i
am
feard
in
field
and

goblin
lead

i
do
begin
to
pity
for
meeting
her
of
late
behind
the
wood
seeking
sweet
favours
for
this
hateful
fool
i
did
upbraid
her
and
fall
out
with
her
for
she
his
hairy
temples
then
had
rounded
with
coronet
of
fresh
and
fragrant
flowers
and
that
same
dew
which
sometime
on
the
buds
was
wont
to
swell
like
round
and
orient
pearls
stood
now
within
the
pretty
flowerets
eyes
like
tears
that
did
their
own
disgrace
bewail
when
i
had
at
my
pleasure
taunted
her
and
she
in
mild
terms
beggd
my
patience
i
then
did
ask
of
her
her
changeling
child
which
straight
she
gave
me
and
her
fairy
sent
to
bear
him
to
my
bower
in
fairy
land
and
now
i
have
the
boy
i
will
undo
this
hateful
imperfection
of
her
eyes
and
gentle
puck
take
this
transformed
scalp
from
off
the
head
of
this
athenian
swain
that
he
awaking
when
the
other
do
may
all
to
athens
back
again
repair
and
think
no
more

swifter
than

wandering
moon
come
my
lord
and
in
our
flight
tell
me
how
it
came
this
night
that
i
sleeping
here
was
found
with
these
mortals
on
the
ground
go
one
of
you
find
out
the
forester
for
now
our
observation
is
performd
and
since
we
have
the
vaward
of
the
day
my
love
shall
hear
the
music
of
my
hounds
uncouple
in
the
western
valley
let
them
go
dispatch
i
say
and
find
the
forester
we
will
fair
queen
up
to
the
mountains
top
and
mark
the
musical
confusion
of
hounds
and
echo
in
conjunction
i
was
with
hercules
and
cadmus
once
when
in
a
wood
of
crete
they
bayd
the
bear
with
hounds
of
sparta
never
did
i
hear
such
gallant
chiding
for
besides
the
groves
the
skies
the
fountains
every
region
near
seemd
all
one
mutual
cry
i
never
heard
so
musical
a
discord
such
sweet
thunder
my
hounds
are
bred
out
of
the
spartan
kind
so
flewd
so
sanded
and
their
heads
are
hung
with
ears
that
sweep
away
the
morning
dew
crookkneed
and
dewlappd
like
thessalian
bulls
slow
in
pursuit
but
matchd
in
mouth
like
bells
each
under
each
a
cry
more
tuneable
was
never
hollad
to
nor
cheerd
with
horn
in
crete
in
sparta
nor
in
thessaly
judge
when
you
hear
but
soft
what
nymphs
are
these
my
lord
this
is
my
daughter
here
asleep
and
this
lysander
this
demetrius
is
this
helena
old
nedars
helena
i
wonder
of
their
being
here
together
no
doubt
they
rose
up
early
to
observe
the
rite
of
may
and
hearing
our
intent
came
here
in
grace
of
our
solemnity
but
speak
egeus
is
not
this
the
day
that
hermia
should
give
answer
of
her
choice
it
is
my
lord
go
bid
the
huntsmen
wake
them
with
their
horns
good
morrow
friends
saint
valentine
is
past
begin
these
woodbirds
but
to
couple
now
pardon
my
lord
i
pray
you
all
stand
up
i
know
you
two
are
rival
enemies
how
comes
this
gentle
concord
in
the
world
that
hatred
is
so
far
from
jealousy
to
sleep
by
hate
and
fear
no
enmity
my
lord
i
shall
reply
amazedly
half
sleep
half
waking
but
as
yet
i
swear
i
cannot
truly
say
how
i
came
here
but
as
i
think
for
truly
would
i
speak
and
now
i
do
bethink
me
so
it
is
i
came
with
hermia
hither
our
intent
was
to
be
gone
from
athens
where
we
might
without
the
peril
of
the
athenian
law
enough
enough
my
lord
you
have
enough
i
beg
the
law
the
law
upon
his
head
they
would
have
stoln
away
they
would
demetrius
thereby
to
have
defeated
you
and
me
you
of
your
wife
and
me
of
my
consent
of
my
consent
that
she
should
be
your
wife
my
lord
fair
helen
told
me
of
their
stealth
of
this
their
purpose
hither
to
this
wood
and
i
in
fury
hither
followd
them
fair
helena
in
fancy
following
me
but
my
good
lord
i
wot
not
by
what
power
but
by
some
power
it
is
my
love
to
hermia
melted
as
doth
the
snow
seems
to
me
now
as
the
remembrance
of
an
idle
gaud
which
in
my
childhood
i
did
dote
upon
and
all
the
faith
the
virtue
of
my
heart
the
object
and
the
pleasure
of
mine
eye
is
only
helena
to
her
my
lord
was
i
betrothd
ere
i
saw
hermia
but
like
in
sickness
did
i
loathe
this
food
but
as
in
health
come
to
my
natural
taste
now
do
i
wish
it
love
it
long
for
it
and
will
for
evermore
be
true
to
it
fair
lovers

athens

a
feast
in
great
solemnity
come
hippolyta
these
things
seem
small
and
undistinguishable
like
faroff
mountains
turned
into
clouds
methinks
i
see
these
things
with
parted
eye
when
everything
seems
double
so
methinks
and
i
have
found
demetrius
like
a
jewel
mine
own
and
not
mine
own
are
you
sure
that
we
are
awake
it
seems
to
me
that

we
sleep

dream

you
not
think
the
duke
was
here
and
bid
us
follow
him

did
bid
us
follow
to
the
temple

life
stolen
hence
and
left
me
asleep
i
have
had
a
most
rare
vision
i
have
had
a
dream
past
the
wit
of
man
to
say
what
dream
it
was
man
is
but
an
ass
if
he
go
about
to
expound
this
dream
methought
i
was
there
is
no
man
can
tell
what
methought
i
was
and
methought
i
had
but
man
is
but
a
patched
fool
if
he
will
offer
to
say
what
methought
i
had
the
eye
of
man
hath
not
heard
the
ear
of
man

not
able
to
taste
his
tongue
to
conceive
nor
his
heart
to
report
what
my
dream
was
i
will
get
peter
quince
to
write
a
ballad
of
this
dream
it
shall
be
called
bottoms

because
it
hath
no
bottom
and
i
will
sing
it
in
the
latter
end
of
a
play
before

to
make
it
the
more
gracious
i
shall
sing
it
at
her
death

house
is
he
come
home
yet
he
cannot
be
heard
of
out
of
doubt

is
transported
if
he
come
not
then
the
play
is
marred
it
goes
not
forward
doth
it
it
is
not
possible
you
have
not
a
man
in
all
athens
able
to
discharge
pyramus
but
he
no
he
hath
simply
the
best
wit
of
any
handicraft
man
in
athens
yea
and
the
best
person
too
and
he
is
a
very
paramour
for
a
sweet
voice
you
must
say
paragon
a
paramour
is
god
bless
us
a
thing
of
naught
masters
the
duke
is
coming
from
the
temple
and
there
is
two
or
three
lords
and
ladies
more
married
if
our
sport
had
gone
forward
we
had
all
been
made
men
o
sweet
bully
bottom
thus
hath
he
lost
sixpence
a
day
during
his
life
he
could
not
have
scaped
sixpence
a
day
an
the
duke
had
not
given
him
sixpence
a
day
for
playing
pyramus
ill
be
hanged
he
would
have
deserved
it
sixpence
a
day
in
pyramus
or
nothing
where
are
these
lads
where
are
these
hearts
bottom
o
most
courageous
day
o
most
happy
hour
masters
i
am
to
discourse
wonders
but
ask
me
not
what
for
if
i
tell
you
i
am
no
true
athenian
i
will
tell
you
everything
right
as
it
fell
out
let
us
hear
sweet
bottom
not
a
word
of
me
all
that
i
will
tell
you
is
that
the
duke
hath
dined
get
your
apparel
together
good
strings
to
your
beards
new
ribbons
to
your
pumps
meet
presently
at
the
palace
every
man
look
oer
his
part
for
the
short
and
the
long
is
our
play
is
preferred
in
any
case
let
thisby
have
clean
linen
and
let
not
him
that
plays
the
lion
pare
his
nails
for
they
shall
hang
out
for
the
lions
claws
and
most
dear
actors
eat
no
onions
nor
garlic
for
we
are
to
utter
sweet
breath
and
i
do
not
doubt
but
to
hear
them
say
it
is
a
sweet
comedy
no
more
words
away
go
away
tis
strange
my
theseus
that
these
lovers
speak
of
more
strange
than
true
i
never
may
believe
these
antique
fables
nor
these
fairy
toys
lovers
and
madmen
have
such
seething
brains
such
shaping
fantasies
that
apprehend
more
than
cool
reason
ever
comprehends
the
lunatic
the
lover
and
the
poet
are
of
imagination
all
compact
one
sees
more
devils
than
vast
hell
can
hold
that
is
the
madman
the
lover
all
as
frantic
sees
helens
beauty
in
a
brow
of
egypt
the
poets
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
doth
glance
from
heaven
to
earth
from
earth
to
heaven
and
as
imagination
bodies
forth
the
forms
of
things
unknown
the
poets
pen
turns
them
to
shapes
and
gives
to
airy
nothing
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
such
tricks
hath
strong
imagination
that
if
it
would
but
apprehend
some
joy
it
comprehends
some
bringer
of
that
joy
or
in
the
night
imagining
some
fear
how
easy
is
a
bush
supposd
a
bear
but
all
the
story
of
the
night
told
over
and
all
their
minds
transfigurd
so
together
more
witnesseth
than
fancys
images
and
grows
to
something
of
great
constancy
but
howsoever
strange
and
admirable
here
come
the
lovers
full
of
joy
and
mirth
joy
gentle
friends
joy
and
fresh
days
of
love
accompany
your
hearts
more
than
to
us
wait
in
your
royal
walks
your
board
your
bed
come
now
what
masques
what
dances
shall
we
have
to
wear
away
this
long
age
of
three
hours
between
our
aftersupper
and
bedtime
where
is
our
usual
manager
of
mirth
what
revels
are
in
hand
is
there
no
play
to
ease
the
anguish
of
a
torturing
hour
call
philostrate
here
mighty
theseus
say
what
abridgment
have
you
for
this
evening
what
masque
what
music
how
shall
we
beguile
the
lazy
time
if
not
with
some
delight
there
is
a
brief
how
many
sports
are
ripe
make
choice
of
which
your
highness
will
see
first
the
battle
with
the
centaurs
to
be
sung
by
an
athenian
eunuch
to
the
harp
well
none
of
that
that
have
i
told
my
love
in
glory
of
my
kinsman
hercules
the
riot
of
the
tipsy
bacchanals
tearing
the
thracian
singer
in
their
rage
that
is
an
old
device
and
it
was
playd
when
i
from
thebes
came
last
a
conqueror
the
thrice
three
muses
mourning
for
the
death
of
learning
late
deceasd
in
beggary
that
is
some
satire
keen
and
critical
not
sorting
with
a
nuptial
ceremony
a
tedious
brief
scene
of
young
pyramus
and
his
love
thisbe
very
tragical
mirth
merry
and
tragical
tedious
and
brief
that
is
hot
ice
and
wonderous
strange
snow
how
shall
we
find
the
concord
of
this
discord
a
play
there
is
my
lord
some
ten
words
long
which
is
as
brief
as
i
have
known
a
play
but
by
ten
words
my
lord
it
is
too
long
which
makes
it
tedious
for
in
all
the
play
there
is
not
one
word
apt
one
player
fitted
and
tragical
my
noble
lord
it
is
for
pyramus
therein
doth
kill
himself
which
when
i
saw
rehearsd
i
must
confess
made
mine
eyes
water
but
more
merry
tears
the
passion
of
loud
laughter
never
shed
what
are
they
that
do
play
it
hardhanded
men
that
work
in
athens
here
which
never
labourd
in
their
minds
till
now
and
now
have
toild
their
unbreathd
memories
with
this
same
play
against
your
nuptial
and
we
will
hear
it
no
my
noble
lord
it
is
not
for
you
i
have
heard
it
over
and
it
is
nothing
nothing
in
the
world
unless
you
can
find
sport
in
their
intents
extremely
stretchd
and
connd
with
cruel
pain
to
do
you
service
i
will
hear
that
play
for
never
anything
can
be
amiss
when
simpleness
and
duty
tender
it
go
bring
them
in
and
take
your
places
ladies
i
love
not
to
see
wretchedness
oerchargd
and
duty
in
his
service
perishing
why
gentle
sweet
you
shall
see
no
such
thing
he
says
they
can
do
nothing
in
this
kind
the
kinder
we
to
give
them
thanks
for
nothing
our
sport
shall
be
to
take
what
they
mistake
and
what
poor
duty
cannot
do
noble
respect
takes
it
in
might
not
merit
where
i
have
come
great
clerks
have
purposed
to
greet
me
with
premeditated
welcomes
where
i
have
seen
them
shiver
and
look
pale
make
periods
in
the
midst
of
sentences
throttle
their
practisd
accent
in
their
fears
and
in
conclusion
dumbly
have
broke
off
not
paying
me
a
welcome
trust
me
sweet
out
of
this
silence
yet
i
pickd
a
welcome
and
in
the
modesty
of
fearful
duty
i
read
as
much
as
from
the
rattling
tongue
of
saucy
and
audacious
eloquence
love
therefore
and
tonguetied
simplicity
in
least
speak
most
to
my
capacity
so
please
your
grace
the
prologue
is
addressd
let
him
approach
if
we
offend
it
is
with
our
good
will
that
you
should
think
we
come
not
to
offend
but
with
good
will
to
show
our
simple
skill
that
is
the
true
beginning
of
our
end
consider
then
we
come
but
in
despite
we
do
not
come
as
minding
to
content
you
our
true
intent
is
all
for
your
delight
we
are
not
here
that
you
should
here
repent
you
the
actors
are
at
hand
and
by
their
show
you
shall
know
all
that
you
are
like
to
know
this
fellow
doth
not
stand
upon
points
he
hath
rid
his
prologue
like
a
rough
colt
he
knows
not
the
stop
a
good
moral
my
lord
it
is
not
enough
to
speak
but
to
speak
true
indeed
he
hath
played
on
his
prologue
like
a
child
on
a
recorder
a
sound
but
not
in
government
his
speech
was
like
a
tangled
chain
nothing
impaired
but
all
disordered
who
is
next
gentles
perchance
you
wonder
at
this
show
but
wonder
on
till
truth
make
all
things
plain
this
man
is
pyramus
if
you
would
know
this
beauteous
lady
thisby
is
certain
this
man
with
lime
and
roughcast
doth
present
wall
that
vile
wall
which
did
these
lovers
sunder
and
through
walls
chink
poor
souls
they
are
content
to
whisper
at
the
which
let
no
man
wonder
this
man
with
lanthorn
dog
and
bush
of
thorn
presenteth
moonshine
for
if
you
will
know
by
moonshine
did
these
lovers
think
no
scorn
to
meet
at
ninus
tomb
there
there
to
woo
this
grisly
beast
which
lion
hight
by
name
the
trusty
thisby
coming
first
by
night
did
scare
away
or
rather
did
affright
and
as
she
fied
her
mantle
she
did
fall
which
lion
vile
with
bloody
mouth
did
stain
anon
comes
pyramus
sweet
youth
and
tall
and
finds
his
trusty
thisbys
mantle
slain
whereat
with
blade
with
bloody
blameful
blade
he
bravely
broachd
his
boiling
bloody
breast
and
thisby
tarrying
in
mulberry
shade
his
dagger
drew
and
died
for
all
the
rest
let
lion
moonshine
wall
and
lovers
twain
at
large
discourse
while
here
they
do
remain
i
wonder
if
the
lion
be
to
speak
no
wonder
my
lord
one
lion
may
when
many
asses
do
wall
in
this
same
interlude
it
doth
befall
that
i
one
snout
by
name
present
a
wall
and
such
a
wall
as
i
would
have
you
think
that
had
in
it
a
crannied
hole
or
chink
through
which
the
lovers
pyramus
and
thisby
did
whisper
often
very
secretly
this
loam
this
roughcast
and
this
stone
doth
show
that
i
am
that
same
wall
the
truth
is
so
and
this
the
cranny
is
right
and
sinister
through
which
the
fearful
lovers
are
to
whisper
would
you
desire
lime
and
hair
to
speak
better
it
is
the
wittiest
partition
that
ever
i
heard
discourse
my
lord
pyramus
draws
near
the
wall
silence
o
grimlookd
night
o
night
with
hue
so
black
o
night
which
ever
art
when
day
is
not
o
night
o
night
alack
alack
alack
i
fear
my
thisbys
promise
is
forgot
and
thou
o
wall
o
sweet
o
lovely
wall
that
standst
between
her
fathers
ground
and
mine
thou
wall
o
wall
o
sweet
and
lovely
wall
show
me
thy
chink
to
blink
through
with
mine
eyne
thanks
courteous
wall
jove

thee
well
for
this
but
what

i
see
o
wicked
wall
through
whom
i
see
no
bliss
cursd
be
thy
stones
for
thus
deceiving
me
the
wall
methinks
being
sensible
should
curse
again
no
in
truth
sir
he
should
not
deceiving
me
is
thisbys
cue
she
is
to
enter
now
and
i
am
to
spy
her
through
the
wall
you
shall
see
it
will
fall
pat
as
i
told
you
yonder
she
comes
o
wall
full
often
hast
thou
heard
my
moans
for
parting
my
fair
pyramus
and
me
my
cherry
lips
have
often
kissd
thy
stones
thy
stones
with
lime
and
hair
knit
up
in
thee
i
see
a
voice
now
will
i
to
the
chink
to
spy
an
i
can
hear
my
thisbys
face
thisby
my
love
thou
art
my
love
i
think

what
thou
wilt
i
am
thy
lovers
grace
and
like
limander
am
i
trusty
still
and
i
like
helen
till
the
fates
me
kill
not
shafalus
to
procrus
was
so
true
as
shafalus
to
procrus
i
to
you
o
kiss
me
through
the
hole
of
this
vile
wall
i
kiss
the
walls
hole
not
your
lips
at
all
wilt
thou
at
ninnys
tomb
meet
me
straightway
tide
life
tide
death
i
come
without
delay
thus
have
i
wall
my
part
discharged
so
and
being
done
thus
wall
away
doth
go
now
is
the
mural
down
between
the
two
neighbours
no
remedy
my
lord
when
walls
are
so
wilful
to
hear
without
warning
this
is
the
silliest
stuff
that
ever
i
heard
the
best
in
this
kind
are
but
shadows
and
the
worst
are
no
worse
if
imagination
amend
them
it
must
be
your
imagination
then
and
not
theirs
if
we
imagine
no
worse
of
them
than
they
of
themselves
they
may
pass
for
excellent
men
here
come
two
noble
beasts
in
a
man
and
a
lion
you
ladies
you
whose
gentle
hearts
do
fear
the
smallest
monstrous
mouse
that
creeps
on
floor
may
now
perchance
both
quake
and
tremble
here
when
lion
rough
in
wildest
rage
doth
roar
then
know
that
i
one
snug
the
joiner
am
a
lionfell
nor
else
no
lions
dam
for
if
i
should
as
lion
come
in
strife
into
this
place
twere
pity
on
my
life
a
very
gentle
beast
and
of
a
good
conscience
the
very
best
at
a
beast
my
lord
that
eer
i
saw
this
lion
is
a
very
fox
for
his
valour
true
and
a
goose
for
his
discretion
not
so
my
lord
for
his
valour
cannot
carry
his
discretion
and
the
fox
carries
the
goose
his
discretion
i
am
sure
cannot
carry
his
valour
for
the
goose
carries
not
the
fox
it
is
well
leave
it
to
his
discretion
and
let
us
listen
to
the
moon
this
lanthorn
doth
the
horned
moon
present
he
should
have
worn
the
horns
on
his
head
he
is
no
crescent
and
his
horns
are
invisible
within
the
circumference
this
lanthorn
doth
the
horned
moon
present
myself
the
man
i
the
moon
do
seem
to
be
this
is
the
greatest
error
of
all
the
rest
the
man
should
be
put
into
the
lanthorn
how
is
it
else
the
man
i
the
moon
he
dares
not
come
there
for
the
candle
for
you
see
it
is
already
in
snuff
i
am
aweary
of
this
moon
would
he
would
change
it
appears
by
his
small
light
of
discretion
that
he
is
in
the
wane
but
yet
in
courtesy
in
all
reason
we
must
stay
the
time
proceed
moon
all
that
i
have
to
say
is
to
tell
you
that
the
lanthorn
is
the
moon
i
the
man
in
the
moon
this
thornbush
my
thornbush
and
this
dog
my
dog
why
all
these
should
be
in
the
lanthorn
for
all
these
are
in
the
moon
but
silence
here
comes
thisbe
this
is
old
ninnys
tomb
where
is
my
love
oh
well
roared
lion
well
run
thisbe
well
shone

truly
the
moon
shines
with
a
good
grace
well
moused
lion
and
then
came
pyramus
and
so
the
lion
vanished
sweet
moon
i
thank
thee
for
thy
sunny
beams
i
thank
thee
moon
for
shining
now
so
bright
for
by
thy
gracious
golden
glittering
streams
i
trust
to
taste
of
truest
thisbys
sight
but
stay
o
spite
but
mark
poor
knight
what
dreadful
dole
is
here
eyes
do
you
see
how
can
it
be
o
dainty
duck
o
dear
thy

what
staind
with

ye
furies

o

come
come

and
quell
this
passion
and
the
death
of
a
dear
friend
would
go
near
to
make
a
man
look
sad
beshrew
my
heart
but
i
pity
the
man
o
wherefore
nature
didst
thou
lions
frame
since
lion
vile
hath
here
deflowerd
my
dear
which
is
no
no
which
was
the
fairest

now
die
die
die

no
die
but
an
ace
for
him
for
he
is
but
one
less
than
an
ace

for
he
is
dead
he
is
nothing
with
the
help
of
a
surgeon
he
might
yet
recover
and
prove
an
ass
how
chance
moonshine
is
gone
before
thisbe
comes
back
and
finds
her
lover
she
will
find
him
by
starlight
here
she
comes
and
her
passion
ends
the
play
methinks
she
should
not
use
a
long
one
for
such
a
pyramus
i
hope
she
will
be
brief
a
mote
will
turn
the
balance
which
pyramus

for
a

she
for
a

us
she
hath
spied
him
already
with
those

moans
videlicet
asleep
my
love
what

o
pyramus
arise

quite
dumb

a
tomb
must
cover
thy

are
left
to
bury
the
dead
ay
and
wall
too
no
i
assure
you
the
wall
is
down
that
parted
their
fathers
will
it
please
you
to
see
the
epilogue
or
to
hear
a
bergomask
dance
between
two
of
our
company
no
epilogue
i
pray
you
for
your
play
needs
no
excuse
never
excuse
for
when
the
players
are
all
dead
there
need
none
to
be
blamed
marry
if
he
that
writ
it
had
played
pyramus
and
hanged
himself
in
thisbes
garter
it
would
have
been
a
fine
tragedy
and
so
it
is
truly
and
very
notably
discharged
but
come
your
bergomask
let
your
epilogue
alone
the
iron
tongue
of
midnight
hath
told
twelve
lovers
to
bed
tis
almost
fairy
time
i
fear
we
shall
outsleep
the
coming
morn
as
much
as
we
this
night
have
overwatchd
this
palpablegross
play
hath
well
beguild
the
heavy
gait
of
night
sweet
friends
to
bed
a
fortnight
hold
we
this
solemnity
in
nightly
revels
and
new
jollity
now
the
hungry
lion
roars
and
the
wolf
behowls
the
moon
whilst
the
heavy
ploughman
snores
all
with
weary
task
fordone
now
the
wasted
brands
do
glow
whilst
the
screechowl
screeching
loud
puts
the
wretch
that
lies
in
woe
in
remembrance
of
a
shroud
now
it
is
the
time
of
night
that
the
graves
all
gaping
wide
every
one
lets
forth
his
sprite
in
the
churchway
paths
to
glide
and
we
fairies
that
do
run
by
the
triple
hecates
team
from
the
presence
of
the
sun
following
darkness
like
a
dream
now
are
frolic
not
a
mouse
shall
disturb
this
hallowd
house
i
am
sent
with
broom
before
to
sweep
the
dust
behind
the
door
through
the
house
give
glimmering
light
by
the
dead
and
drowsy
fire
every
elf
and
fairy
sprite
hop
as
light
as
bird
from
brier
and
this
ditty
after
me
sing
and
dance
it
trippingly
first
rehearse
your
song
by
rote
to
each
word
a
warbling
note
hand
in
hand
with
fairy
grace
will
we
sing
and
bless
this
place
now
until
the
break
of
day
through
this
house
each
fairy
stray
to
the
best
bridebed
will

ever

of
it
blest

away
make
no

meet
me
all
by
break
of
day
if
we
shadows
have
offended
think
but
this
and
all
is
mended
that
you
have
but
slumberd
here
while
these
visions
did
appear
and
this
weak
and
idle
theme
no
more
yielding
but
a
dream
gentles
do
not
reprehend
if
you
pardon
we
will
mend
and
as
im
an
honest
puck
if
we
have
unearned
luck
now
to
scape
the
serpents
tongue
we
will
make
amends
ere
long
else
the
puck
a
liar
call
so
good
night
unto
you
all
give
me
your
hands
if
we
be
friends
and
robin
shall
restore
amends
alls
well
that
ends
well
in
delivering
my
son
from
me
i
bury
a
second
husband
and
i
in
going
madam
weep
oer
my
fathers
death
anew
but
i
must
attend
his
majestys
command
to
whom
i
am
now
in
ward
evermore
in
subjection
you
shall
find
of
the
king
a
husband
madam
you
sir
a
father
he
that
so
generally
is
at
all
times
good
must
of
necessity
hold
his
virtue
to
you
whose
worthiness
would
stir
it
up
where
it
wanted
rather
than
lack
it
where
there
is
such
abundance
what
hope
is
there
of
his
majestys
amendment
he
hath
abandoned
his
physicians
madam
under
whose
practices
he
hath
persecuted
time
with
hope
and
finds
no
other
advantage
in
the
process
but
only
the
losing
of
hope
by
time
this
young
gentlewoman
had
a
father
o
that
had
how
sad
a
passage
tis
whose
skill
was
almost
as
great
as
his
honesty
had
it
stretched
so
far
would
have
made
nature
immortal
and
death
should
have
play
for
lack
of
work
would
for
the
kings
sake
he
were
living
i
think
it
would
be
the
death
of
the
kings
disease
how
called
you
the
man
you
speak
of
madam
he
was
famous
sir
in
his
profession
and
it
was
his
great
right
to
be
so
gerard
de
narbon
he
was
excellent
indeed
madam
the
king
very
lately
spoke
of
him
admiringly
and
mourningly
he
was
skilful
enough
to
have
lived
still
if
knowledge
could
be
set
up
against
mortality
what
is
it
my
good
lord
the
king
languishes
of
a
fistula
my
lord
i
heard
not
of
it
before
i
would
it
were
not
notorious
was
this
gentlewoman
the
daughter
of
gerard
de
narbon
his
sole
child
my
lord
and
bequeathed
to
my
overlooking
i
have
those
hopes
of
her
good
that
her
education
promises
her
dispositions
she
inherits
which
makes
fair
gifts
fairer
for
where
an
unclean
mind
carries
virtuous
qualities
there
commendations
go
with
pity
they
are
virtues
and
traitors
too
in
her
they
are
the
better
for
their
simpleness
she
derives
her
honesty
and
achieves
her
goodness
your
commendations
madam
get
from
her
tears
tis
the
best
brine
a
maiden
can
season
her
praise
in
the
remembrance
of
her
father
never
approaches
her
heart
but
the
tyranny
of
her
sorrows
takes
all
livelihood
from
her
cheek
no
more
of
this
helena
go
to
no
more
lest
it
be
rather
thought
you
affect
a
sorrow
than
have
it
i
do
affect
a
sorrow
indeed
but
i
have
it
too
moderate
lamentation
is
the
right
of
the
dead
excessive
grief
the
enemy
to
the
living
if
the
living
be
enemy
to
the
grief
the
excess
makes
it
soon
mortal
madam
i
desire
your
holy
wishes
how
understand
we
that
be
thou
blest
bertram
and
succeed
thy
father
in
manners
as
in
shape
thy
blood
and
virtue
contend
for
empire
in
thee
and
thy
goodness
share
with
thy
birthright
love
all
trust
a
few
do
wrong
to
none
be
able
for
thine
enemy
rather
in
power
than
use
and
keep
thy
friend
under
thy
own
lifes
key
be
checkd
for
silence
but
never
taxd
for
speech
what
heaven
more
will
that
thee
may
furnish
and
my
prayers
pluck
down
fall
on
thy
head
farewell
my
lord
tis
an
unseasond
courtier
good
my
lord
advise
him
he
cannot
want
the
best
that
shall
attend
his
love
heaven
bless
him
farewell
bertram
the
best
wishes
that
can
be
forged
in
your
thoughts
be
servants
to
you
be
comfortable
to
my
mother
your
mistress
and
make
much
of
her
farewell
pretty
lady
you
must
hold
the
credit
of
your
father
o
were
that
all
i
think
not
on
my
father
and
these
great
tears
grace
his
remembrance
more
than
those
i
shed
for
him
what
was
he
like
i
have
forgot
him
my
imagination
carries
no
favour
int
but
bertrams
i
am
undone
there
is
no
living
none
if
bertram
be
away
it
were
all
one
that
i
should
love
a
bright
particular
star
and
think
to
wed
it
he
is
so
above
me
in
his
bright
radiance
and
collateral
light
must
i
be
comforted
not
in
his
sphere
the
ambition
in
my
love
thus
plagues
itself
the
hind
that
would
be
mated
by
the
lion
must
die
for
love
twas
pretty
though
a
plague
to
see
him
every
hour
to
sit
and
draw
his
arched
brows
his
hawking
eye
his
curls
in
our
hearts
table
heart
too
capable
of
every
line
and
trick
of
his
sweet
favour
but
now
hes
gone
and
my
idolatrous
fancy
must
sanctify
his
reliques
who
comes
here
one
that
goes
with
him
i
love
him
for
his
sake
and
yet
i
know
him
a
notorious
liar
think
him
a
great
way
fool
solely
a
coward
yet
these
fixd
evils
sit
so
fit
in
him
that
they
take
place
when
virtues
steely
bones
look
bleak
in
the
cold
wind
withal
full
oft
we
see
cold
wisdom
waiting
on
superfluous
folly
save
you
fair
queen
and
you
monarch
no
and
no
are
you
meditating
on
virginity
ay
you
have
some
stain
of
soldier
in
you
let
me
ask
you
a
question
man
is
enemy
to
virginity
how
may
we
barricado
it
against
him
keep
him
out
but
he
assails
and
our
virginity
though
valiant
in
the
defence
yet
is
weak
unfold
to
us
some
warlike
resistance
there
is
none
man
sitting
down
before
you
will
undermine
you
and
blow
you
up
bless
our
poor
virginity
from
underminers
and
blowers
up
is
there
no
military
policy
how
virgins
might
blow
up
men
virginity
being
blown
down
man
will
quicklier
be
blown
up
marry
in
blowing
him
down
again
with
the
breach
yourselves
made
you
lose
your
city
it
is
not
politic
in
the
commonwealth
of
nature
to
preserve
virginity
loss
of
virginity
is
rational
increase
and
there
was
never
virgin
got
till
virginity
was
first
lost
that
you
were
made
of
is
metal
to
make
virgins
virginity
by
being
once
lost
may
be
ten
times
found
by
being
ever
kept
it
is
ever
lost
tis
too
cold
a
companion
away
witht
i
will
stand
fort
a
little
though
therefore
i
die
a
virgin
theres
little
can
be
said
int
tis
against
the
rule
of
nature
to
speak
on
the
part
of
virginity
is
to
accuse
your
mothers
which
is
most
infallible
disobedience
he
that
hangs
himself
is
a
virgin
virginity
murders
itself
and
should
be
buried
in
highways
out
of
all
sanctified
limit
as
a
desperate
offendress
against
nature
virginity
breeds
mites
much
like
a
cheese
consumes
itself
to
the
very
paring
and
so
dies
with
feeding
his
own
stomach
besides
virginity
is
peevish
proud
idle
made
of
selflove
which
is
the
most
inhibited
sin
in
the
canon
keep
it
not
you
cannot
choose
but
lose
byt
out
witht
within
the
year
it
will
make
itself
two
which
is
a
goodly
increase
and
the
principal
itself
not
much
the
worse
away
witht
how
might
one
do
sir
to
lose
it
to
her
own
liking
let
me
see
marry
ill
to
like
him
that
neer
it
likes
tis
a
commodity
that
will
lose
the
gloss
with
lying
the
longer
kept
the
less
worth
off
witht
while
tis
vendible
answer
the
time
of
request
virginity
like
an
old
courtier
wears
her
cap
out
of
fashion
richly
suited
but
unsuitable
just
like
the
brooch
and
the
toothpick
which
wear
not
now
your
date
is
better
in
your
pie
and
your
porridge
than
in
your
cheek
and
your
virginity
your
old
virginity
is
like
one
of
our
french
withered
pears
it
looks
ill
it
eats
drily
marry
tis
a
withered
pear
it
was
formerly
better
marry
yet
tis
a
withered
pear
will
you
anything
with
it
not
my
virginity
yet
there
shall
your
master
have
a
thousand
loves
a
mother
and
a
mistress
and
a
friend
a
ph
nix
captain
and
an
enemy
a
guide
a
goddess
and
a
sovereign
a
counsellor
a
traitress
and
a
dear
his
humble
ambition
proud
humility
his
jarring
concord
and
his
discord
dulcet
his
faith
his
sweet
disaster
with
a
world
of
pretty
fond
adoptious
christendoms
that
blinking
cupid
gossips
now
shall
he
i
know
not
what
he
shall
god
send
him
well
the
courts
a
learningplace
and
he
is
one
what
one
i
faith
that
i
wish
well
tis
pity
whats
pity
that
wishing
well
had
not
a
body
int
which
might
be
felt
that
we
the
poorer
born
whose
baser
stars
do
shut
us
up
in
wishes
might
with
effects
of
them
follow
our
friends
and
show
what
we
alone
must
think
which
never
returns
us
thanks
monsieur
parolles
my
lord
calls
for
you
little
helen
farewell
if
i
can
remember
thee
i
will
think
of
thee
at
court
monsieur
parolles
you
were
born
under
a
charitable
star
under
mars
i
i
especially
think
under
mars
why
under
mars
the
wars
have
so
kept
you
under
that
you
must
needs
be
born
under
mars
when
he
was
predominant
when
he
was
retrograde
i
think
rather
why
think
you
so
you
go
so
much
backward
when
you
fight
thats
for
advantage
so
is
running
away
when
fear
proposes
the
safety
but
the
composition
that
your
valour
and
fear
makes
in
you
is
a
virtue
of
a
good
wing
and
i
like
the
wear
well
i
am
so
full
of
businesses
i
cannot
answer
thee
acutely
i
will
return
perfect
courtier
in
the
which
my
instruction
shall
serve
to
naturalize
thee
so
thou
wilt
be
capable
of
a
courtiers
counsel
and
understand
what
advice
shall
thrust
upon
thee
else
thou
diest
in
thine
unthankfulness
and
thine
ignorance
makes
thee
away
farewell
when
thou
hast
leisure
say
thy
prayers
when
thou
hast
none
remember
thy
friends
get
thee
a
good
husband
and
use
him
as
he
uses
thee
so
farewell
our
remedies
oft
in
ourselves
do
lie
which
we
ascribe
to
heaven
the
fated
sky
gives
us
free
scope
only
doth
backward
pull
our
slow
designs
when
we
ourselves
are
dull
what
power
is
it
which
mounts
my
love
so
high
that
makes
me
see
and
cannot
feed
mine
eye
the
mightiest
space
in
fortune
nature
brings
to
join
like
likes
and
kiss
like
native
things
impossible
be
strange
attempts
to
those
that
weigh
their
pains
in
sense
and
do
suppose
what
hath
been
cannot
be
who
ever
strove
to
show
her
merit
that
did
miss
her
love
the
kings
disease
my
project
may
deceive
me
but
my
intents
are
fixd
and
will
not
leave
me
the
florentines
and
senoys
are
by
the
ears
have
fought
with
equal
fortune
and
continue
a
braving
war
so
tis
reported
sir
nay
tis
most
credible
we
here
receive
it
a
certainty
vouchd
from
our
cousin
austria
with
caution
that
the
florentine
will
move
us
for
speedy
aid
wherein
our
dearest
friend
prejudicates
the
business
and
would
seem
to
have
us
make
denial
his
love
and
wisdom
approvd
so
to
your
majesty
may
plead
for
amplest
credence
he
hath
armd
our
answer
and
florence
is
denied
before
he
comes
yet
for
our
gentlemen
that
mean
to
see
the
tuscan
service
freely
have
they
leave
to
stand
on
either
part
it
well
may
serve
a
nursery
to
our
gentry
who
are
sick
for
breathing
and
exploit
whats
he
comes
here
it
is
the
count
rousillon
my
good
lord
young
betram
youth
thou
bearst
thy
fathers
face
frank
nature
rather
curious
than
in
haste
hath
well
composd
thee
thy
fathers
moral
parts
mayst
thou
inherit
too
welcome
to
paris
my
thanks
and
duty
are
your
majestys
i
would
i
had
that
corporal
soundness
now
as
when
thy
father
and
myself
in
friendship
first
tried
our
soldiership
he
did
look
far
into
the
service
of
the
time
and
was
discipled
of
the
bravest
he
lasted
long
but
on
us
both
did
haggish
age
steal
on
and
wore
us
out
of
act
it
much
repairs
me
to
talk
of
your
good
father
in
his
youth
he
had
the
wit
which
i
can
well
observe
today
in
our
young
lords
but
they
may
jest
till
their
own
scorn
return
to
them
unnoted
ere
they
can
hide
their
levity
in
honour
so
like
a
courtier
contempt
nor
bitterness
were
in
his
pride
or
sharpness
if
they
were
his
equal
had
awakd
them
and
his
honour
clock
to
itself
knew
the
true
minute
when
exception
bid
him
speak
and
at
this
time
his
tongue
obeyd
his
hand
who
were
below
him
he
usd
as
creatures
of
another
place
and
bowd
his
eminent
top
to
their
low
ranks
making
them
proud
of
his
humility
in
their
poor
praise
he
humbled
such
a
man
might
be
a
copy
to
these
younger
times
which
followd
well
would
demonstrate
them
now
but
goers
backward
his
good
remembrance
sir
lies
richer
in
your
thoughts
than
on
his
tomb
so
in
approof
lives
not
his
epitaph
as
in
your
royal
speech
would
i
were
with
him
he
would
always
say
methinks
i
hear
him
now
his
plausive
words
he
scatterd
not
in
ears
but
grafted
them
to
grow
there
and
to
bear
let
me
not
live
thus
his
good
melancholy
oft
began
on
the
catastrophe
and
heel
of
pastime
when
it
was
out
let
me
not
live
quoth
he
after
my
flame
lacks
oil
to
be
the
snuff
of
younger
spirits
whose
apprehensive
senses
all
but
new
things
disdain
whose
judgments
are
mere
fathers
of
their
garments
whose
constancies
expire
before
their
fashions
this
he
wishd
i
after
him
do
after
him
wish
too
since
i
nor
wax
nor
honey
can
bring
home
i
quickly
were
dissolved
from
my
hive
to
give
some
labourers
room
you
are
lovd
sir
they
that
least
lend
it
you
shall
lack
you
first
i
fill
a
place
i
knowt
how
long
ist
count
since
the
physician
at
your
fathers
died
he
was
much
famd
some
six
months
since
my
lord
if
he
were
living
i
would
try
him
yet
lend
me
an
arm
the
rest
have
worn
me
out
with
several
applications
nature
and
sickness
debate
it
at
their
leisure
welcome
count
my
sons
no
dearer
thank
your
majesty

will
now
hear
what
say
you
of
this
gentlewoman
madam
the
care
i
have
had
to
even
your
content
i
wish
might
be
found
in
the
calendar
of
my
past
endeavours
for
then
we
wound
our
modesty
and
make
foul
the
clearness
of
our
deservings
when
of
ourselves
we
publish
them
what
does
this
knave
here
get
you
gone
sirrah
the
complaints
i
have
heard
of
you
i
do
not
all
believe
tis
my
slowness
that
i
do
not
for
i
know
you
lack
not
folly
to
commit
them
and
have
ability
enough
to
make
such
knaveries
yours
tis
not
unknown
to
you
madam
i
am
a
poor
fellow
well
sir
no
madam

not
so
well
that
i
am
poor
though
many
of
the
rich
are
damned
but
if
i
may

yet
in
this
captious
and
intenible
sieve
i
still
pour
in
the
waters
of
my

and
lack
not

still
thus
indianlike
religious
in

error
i
adore
the

no

my
dearest
madam
let
not
your
hate
encounter
with
my
love
for
loving
where
you
do
but
if
yourself
whose
aged
honour
cites
a
virtuous
youth
did
ever
in
so
true
a
flame
of
liking
wish
chastely
and
love
dearly
that
your
dian
was
both
herself
and
love
o
then
give
pity
to
her
whose
state
is
such
that
cannot
choose
but
lend
and
give
where
she
is
sure
to
lose
that
seeks
not
to
find
that
her
search
implies
but
riddlelike
lives
sweetly
where
she
dies
had
you
not
lately
an
intent
speak
truly
to
go
to
paris
madam
i
had
wherefore
tell
true
i
will
tell
truth
by
grace
itself
i
swear
you
know
my
father
left
me
some
prescriptions
of
rare
and
provd
effects
such
as
his
reading
and
manifest
experience
had
collected
for
general
sovereignty
and
that
he
willd
me
in
heedfullst
reservation
to
bestow
them
as
notes
whose
faculties
inclusive
were
more
than
they
were
in
note
amongst
the
rest
there
is
a
remedy
approvd
set
down
to
cure
the
desperate
languishings
whereof
the
king
is
renderd
lost
this
was
your
motive
for
paris
was
it
speak
my
lord
your
son
made
me
to
think
of
this
else
paris
and
the
medicine
and
the
king
had
from
the
conversation
of
my
thoughts
haply
been
absent
then
but
think
you
helen
if
you
should
tender
your
supposed
aid
he
would
receive
it
he
and
his
physicians
are
of
a
mind
he
that
they
cannot
help
him
they
that
they
cannot
help
how
shall
they
credit
a
poor
unlearned
virgin
when
the
schools
embowelld
of
their
doctrine
have
left
off
the
danger
to
itself
theres
something
int
more
than
my
fathers
skill
which
was
the
greatst
of
his
profession
that
his
good
receipt
shall
for
my
legacy
be
sanctified
by
the
luckiest
stars
in
heaven
and
would
your
honour
but
give
me
leave
to
try
success
id
venture
the
welllost

such
a
day

you
well
now
fair
one
does
your
business
follow
us
ay
my
good
lord
gerard
de
narbon
was
my
father
in
what
he
did
profess
well
found
i
knew
him
the
rather
will
i
spare
my
praises
towards
him
knowing
him
is
enough
ons
bed
of
death
many
receipts
he
gave
me
chiefly
one
which
as
the
dearest
issue
of
his
practice
and
of
his
old
experience
the
only
darling
he
bade
me
store
up
as
a
triple
eye
safer
than
mine
own
two
more
dear
i
have
so
and
hearing
your
high
majesty
is
touchd
with
that
malignant
cause
wherein
the
honour
of
my
dear
fathers
gift
stands
chief
in
power
i
come
to
tender
it
and
my
appliance
with
all
bound
humbleness
we
thank
you
maiden
but
may
not
be
so
credulous
of
cure
when
our
most
learned
doctors
leave
us
and
the
congregated
college
have
concluded
that
labouring
art
can
never
ransom
nature
from
her
inaidable
estate
i
say
we
must
not
so
stain
our
judgment
or
corrupt
our
hope
to
prostitute
our
pastcure
malady
to
empirics
or
to
dissever
so
our
great
self
and
our
credit
to
esteem
a
senseless
help
when
help
past
sense
we
deem
my
duty
then
shall
pay
me
for
my
pains
i
will
no
more
enforce
mine
office
on
you
humbly
entreating
from
your
royal
thoughts
a
modest
one
to
bear
me
back
again
i
cannot
give
thee
less
to
be
calld
grateful
thou
thoughtst
to
help
me
and
such
thanks
i
give
as
one
near
death
to
those
that
wish
him
live
but
what
at
full
i
know
thou
knowst
no
part
i
knowing
all
my
peril
thou
no
art
what
i
can
do
can
do
no
hurt
to
try
since
you
set
up
your
rest
gainst
remedy
he
that
of
greatest
works
is
finisher
oft
does
them
by
the
weakest
minister
so
holy
writ
in
babes
hath
judgment
shown
when
judges
have
been
babes
great
floods
have
flown
from
simple
sources
and
great
seas
have
dried
when
miracles
have
by
the
greatest
been
denied
oft
expectation
fails
and
most
oft
there
where
most
it
promises
and
oft
it
hits
where
hope
is
coldest
and
despair
most
fits
i
must
not
hear
thee
fare
thee
well
kind
maid
thy
pains
not
usd
must
by
thyself
be
paid
proffers
not
took
reap
thanks
for
their
reward
inspired
merit
so
by
breath
is
barrd
it
is
not
so
with
him
that
all
things
knows
as
tis
with
us
that
square
our
guess
by
shows
but
most
it
is
presumption
in
us
when
the
help
of
heaven
we
count
the
act
of
men
dear
sir
to
my
endeavours
give
consent
of
heaven
not
me
make
an
experiment
i
am
not
an
impostor
that
proclaim
myself
against
the
level
of
mine
aim
but
know
i
think
and
think
i
know
most
sure
my
art
is
not
past
power
nor
you
past

art
thou

he
that

nothing
has
neither

lip
nor

and
indeed
such
a
fellow
to
say
precisely
were
not
for
the
court
but
for
me
i
have
an
answer
will
serve
all
men
marry
thats
a
bountiful
answer
that
fits
all
questions
it
is
like
a
barbers
chair
that
fits
all
buttocks
the
pinbuttock
the
quatchbuttock
the
brawnbuttock
or
any
buttock
will
your
answer
serve
fit
to
all
questions
as
fit
as
ten

is
for
the
hand
of
an
attorney
as
your
french
crown
for
your
taffeta

as

for

as
the

the
cuckold
to

as
a

quean
to
a
wrangling
knave
as
the
nuns
lip
to
the
friars
mouth
nay
as
the
pudding
to
his
skin
have
you
i
say
an
answer
of
such
fitness
for
all
questions
from
below
your
duke
to
beneath
your
constable
it
will
fit
any
question
it
must
be
an
answer
of
most
monstrous
size
that
must
fit
all
demands
but
a
trifle
neither
in
good
faith
if
the
learned
should
speak
truth
of
it
here
it
is
and
all
that
belongs
tot
ask
me
if
i
am
a
courtier
it
shall
do
you
no
harm
to
learn
to
be
young
again
if
we
could
i
will
be
a
fool
in
question
hoping
to
be
the
wiser
by
your
answer
i
pray
you
sir
are
you
a
courtier
o
lord
sir
theres
a
simple
putting
off
more
more
a
hundred
of
them
sir
i
am
a
poor
friend
of
yours
that
loves
you
o
lord
sir
thick
thick
spare
not
me
i
think
sir
you
can
eat
none
of
this
homely
meat
o
lord
sir
nay
put
me
tot
i
warrant
you
you
were
lately
whipped
sir
as
i
think
o
lord
sir
spare
not
me
do
you
cry
o
lord
sir
at
your
whipping
and
spare
not
me
indeed
your
o
lord
sir
is
very
sequent
to
your
whipping
you
would
answer
very
well
to
a
whipping
if
you
were
but
bound
tot
i
neer
had
worse
luck
in
my
life
in
my
o
lord
sir
i
see
things
may
serve
long
but
not
serve
ever
i
play
the
noble
housewife
with
the
time
to
entertaint
so
merrily
with
a
fool
o
lord
sir
why
theret
serves
well
again
an
end
sir
to
your
business
give
helen
this
and
urge
her
to
a
present
answer
back
commend
me
to
my
kinsmen
and
my
son
this
is
not
much
not
much
commendation
to
them
not
much
employment
for
you
you
understand
me
most
fruitfully
i
am
there
before
my
legs
haste
you
again
they
say
miracles
are
past
and
we
have
our
philosophical
persons
to
make
modern
and
familiar
things
supernatural
and
causeless
hence
is
it
that
we
make
trifles
of
terrors
ensconcing
ourselves
into
seeming
knowledge
when
we
should
submit
ourselves
to
an
unknown
fear
why
tis
the
rarest
argument
of
wonder
that
hath
shot
out
in
our
latter
times
and
so
tis
to
be
relinquished
of
the
artists
so
i
say
both
of
galen
and
paracelsus
so
i
say
of
all
the
learned
and
authentic
fellows
right
so
i
say
that
gave
him
out
incurable
why
there
tis
so
say
i
too
not
to
be
helped
right
as
twere
a
man
assured
of
a
uncertain
life
and
sure
death
just
you
say
well
so
would
i
have
said
i
may
truly
say
it
is
a
novelty
to
the
world
it
is
indeed
if
you
will
have
it
in
showing
you
shall
read
it
in
what
do
you
call
there
a
showing
of
a
heavenly
effect
in
an
earthly
actor
thats
it
i
would
have
said
the
very
same
why
your
dolphin
is
not
lustier
fore
me
i
speak
in
respect
nay
tis
strange
tis
very
strange
that
is
the
brief
and
the
tedious
of
it
and
he
is
of
a
most
facinorous
spirit
that
will
not
acknowledge
it
to
be
the
very
hand
of
heaven
ay
so
i
say
in
a
most
weak
and
debile
minister
great
power
great
transcendence
which
should
indeed
give
us
a
further
use
to
be
made
than
alone
the
recovery
of
the
king
as
to
be
generally
thankful
i
would
have
said
it
you
say
well
here
comes
the
king
lustig
as
the
dutchman
says
ill
like
a
maid
the
better
whilst
i
have
a
tooth
in
my
head
why
hes
able
to
lead
her
a
coranto
mort
du
vinaigre
is
not
this
helen
fore
god
i
think
so
go
call
before
me
all
the
lords
in
court
sit
my
preserver
by
thy
patients
side
and
with
this
healthful
hand

banishd
sense

hast
repeald

second

the
confirmation
of
my
promised
gift

the
blushes

white
death

cheek
for
ever

neer
come
there
again

choice
and
see
who
shuns
thy
love

all
his
love
in

grant

thanks
sir
all
the
rest

amesace
for
my
life
the
honour
sir
that
flames
in
your
fair
eyes
before
i
speak
too
threateningly
replies

fortunes
twenty
times
above

that
so
wishes
and
her
humble
love
no
better
if
you
please
my
wish

which
great
love

and
so
i
take
my
leave
do
all
they
deny
her
an
they
were
sons
of
mine
id
have
them
whippd
or
i
would
send

turk
to
make
eunuchs
of
be
not
afraid
that
i
your
hand
should
take
ill
never
do

sake
blessing
upon

vows
and
in
your
bed
find
fairer
fortune
if
you
ever
wed
these
boys
are
boys
of
ice
theyll
none
have
her
sure
they
are
bastards
to
the
english
the
french
neer
got
em
you
are
too
young
too
happy
and
too
good
to
make
yourself
a
son
out
of
my
blood
fair
one
i
think
not
so
theres
one
grape
yet
i
am
sure
thy
father
drunk
wine
but
if
thou
best
not
an
ass
i
am
a
youth
of
fourteen
i
have
known
thee
already
i
dare
not
say
i
take
you
but
i
give
me
and
my
service
ever
whilst
i
live
into
your
guiding
power
this
is
the
man
why
then
young
bertram
take
her
shes
thy
wife
my
wife
my
liege
i
shall
beseech
your
highness
in
such
a
business
give
me
leave
to
use
the
help
of
mine
own
eyes
knowst
thou
not
bertram
what
she
has
done
for
me
yes
my
good
lord
but
never
hope
to
know
why
i
should
marry
her
thou
knowst
she
has
raisd
me
from
my
sickly
bed
but
follows
it
my
lord
to
bring
me
down
must
answer
for
your
raising
i
know
her
well
she
had
her
breeding
at
my
fathers
charge
a
poor
physicians
daughter
my
wife
disdain
rather
corrupt
me
ever
tis
only
title
thou
disdainst
in
her
the
which
i
can
build
up
strange
is
it
that
our
bloods
of
colour
weight
and
heat
pourd
all
together
would
quite
confound
distinction
yet
stand
off
in
differences
so
mighty
if
she
be
all
that
is
virtuous
save
what
thou
dislikst
a
poor
physicians
daughter
thou
dislikst
of
virtue
for
the
name
but
do
not
so
from
lowest
place
when
virtuous
things
proceed
the
place
is
dignified
by
the
doers
deed
where
great
additions
swells
and
virtue
none
it
is
a
dropsied
honour
good
alone
is
good
without
a
name
vileness
is
so
the
property
by
what
it
is
should
go
not
by
the
title
she
is
young
wise
fair
in
these
to
nature
shes
immediate
heir
and
these
breed
honour
that
is
honours
scorn
which
challenges
itself
as
honours
born
and
is
not
like
the
sire
honours
thrive
when
rather
from
our
acts
we
them
derive
than
our
foregoers
the
mere
words
a
slave
deboshd
on
every
tomb
on
every
grave
a
lying
trophy
and
as
oft
is
dumb
where
dust
and
damnd
oblivion
is
the
tomb
of
honourd
bones
indeed
what
should
be
said
if
thou
canst
like
this
creature
as
a
maid
i
can
create
the
rest
virtue
and
she
is
her
own
dower
honour
and
wealth
from
me
i
cannot
love
her
nor
will
strive
to
dot
thou
wrongst
thyself
if
thou
shouldst
strive
to
choose
that
you
are
well
restord
my
lord
im
glad
let
the
rest
go
my
honours
at
the
stake
which
to
defeat
i
must
produce
my
power
here
take
her
hand
proud
scornful
boy
unworthy
this
good
gift
that
dost
in
vile
misprision
shackle
up
my
love
and
her
desert
thou
canst
not
dream
we
poising
us
in
her
defective
scale
shall
weigh
thee
to
the
beam
that
wilt
not
know
it
is
in
us
to
plant
thine
honour
where
we
please
to
have
it
grow
check
thy
contempt
obey
our
will
which
travails
in
thy
good
believe
not
thy
disdain
but
presently
do
thine
own
fortunes
that
obedient
right
which
both
thy
duty
owes
and
our
power
claims
or
i
will
throw
thee
from
my
care
for
ever
into
the
staggers
and
the
careless
lapse
of
youth
and
ignorance
both
my
revenge
and
hate
loosing
upon
thee
in
the
name
of
justice
without
all
terms
of
pity
speak
thine
answer
pardon
my
gracious
lord
for
i
submit
my
fancy
to
your
eyes
when
i
consider
what
great
creation
and
what
dole
of
honour
flies
where
you
bid
it
i
find
that
she
which
late
was
in
my
nobler
thoughts
most
base
is
now
the
praised
of
the
king
who
so
ennobled
is
as
twere
born
so
take
her
by
the
hand
and
tell
her
she
is
thine
to
whom
i
promise
a
counterpoise
if
not
to
thy
estate
a
balance
more
replete
i
take
her
hand
good
fortune
and
the
favour
of
the
king
smile
upon
this
contract
whose
ceremony
shall
seem
expedient
on
the
nowborn
brief
and
be
performd
tonight
the
solemn
feast
shall
more
attend
upon
the
coming
space
expecting
absent
friends
as
thou
lovst
her
thy
loves
to
me
religious
else
does
err

most
harsh
one

i
did
think
thee
for
two
ordinaries
to
be
a
pretty
wise
fellow
thou
didst
make
tolerable
vent
of
thy
travel
it
might
pass
yet
the
scarfs
and
the
bannerets
about
thee
did
manifoldly
dissuade
me
from
believing
thee
a
vessel
of
too
great
a
burden
i
have
now
found
thee
when
i
lose
thee
again
i
care
not
yet
art
thou
good

nothing
but
taking
up

worth
hadst
thou
not
the
privilege
of
antiquity
upon

plunge
thyself
too
far
in
anger
lest

a
hen

dram
of
it
and
i
will
not
bate
thee
a
scruple
well
i
shall
be
wiser

as
soon
as
thou
canst
for
thou
hast
to
pull
at
a
smack
o
the
contrary
if
ever
thou
best
bound
in
thy
scarf
and
beaten
thou
shalt
find
what
it
is
to
be
proud
of
thy
bondage
i
have
a
desire
to
hold
my
acquaintance
with
thee
or
rather
my
knowledge
that

may
say
in
the
default
he
is
a
man
i
know
my
lord
you
do
me
most
insupportable
vexation
i
would
it
were
hellpains
for
thy
sake
and
my
poor
doing
eternal
for
doing
i
am
past
as
i
will
by
thee
in
what
motion

give
me
leave
well
thou
hast
a
son
shall
take
this
disgrace
off
me
scurvy
old
filthy
scurvy
lord
well
i
must
be
patient
there
is
no
fettering
of
authority
ill
beat
him
by
my
life
if
i
can
meet
him
with
any
convenience
an
he
were
double
and
double
a
lord

have
no
more
pity
of
his
age
than

your
lord

news

unfeignedly
beseech
your

make
some
reservation
of
your
wrongs

my
good
lord

my
master

by
mine
honour
if

two
hours
younger

thou
art
a
general
offence
and
every
man

beat
thee

breathe
themselves
upon
thee

is
hard
and
undeserved
measure

beaten
in
italy
for
picking
a
kernel
out
of
a
pomegranate
you
are
a
vagabond
and
no
true
traveller
you
are
more
saucy
with
lords
and
honourable
personages
than
the
heraldry
of
your
birth
and
virtue
gives
you
commission
you
are
not
worth
another
word
else
id
call
you
knave

hugs
his
kickywicky

his
manly
marrow
in
her
arms
which

sustain
the
bound
and

curvet
of

steed
to
other
regions
france

knave

my
old
lady
so
that
you
had
her
wrinkles
and
i
her
money
i
would
she
did
as
you
say
why
i
say
nothing
marry
you
are
the
wiser
man
for
many
a
mans
tongue
shakes
out
his
masters
undoing
to
say
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
know
nothing
and
to
have
nothing
is
to
be
a
great
part
of
your
title
which
is
within
a
very
little
of
nothing
away
thourt
a
knave
you
should
have
said
sir
before
a
knave
thourt
a
knave
that
is
before
me
thourt
a
knave
this
had
been
truth
sir
go

thou
art
a
witty
fool
i
have
found
thee
did
you
find
me
in
yourself
sir
or
were
you
taught
to
find
me
the
search
sir
was
profitable
and
much
fool
may
you
find
in
you
even
to
the
worlds
pleasure
and
the
increase
of
laughter
a
good
knave
i
faith
and
well
fed
madam
my
lord
will
go
away
tonight
a
very
serious
business
calls
on
him
the
great
prerogative
and
rite
of
love
which
as
your
due
time
claims
he
does
acknowledge
but
puts
it
off
to
a
compelld
restraint
whose
want
and
whose
delay
is
strewd
with
sweets
which
they
distil
now
in
the
curbed
time
to
make
the
coming
hour
oerflow
with
joy
and
pleasure
drown
the
brim
whats
his
will
else
that
you
will
take
your
instant
leave
o
the
king
and
make
this
haste
as
your
own
good
proceeding
strengthend
with
what
apology
you
think
may
make
it
probable
need
what
more
commands
he
that
having
this
obtaind
you
presently
attend
his
further
pleasure
in
everything
i
wait
upon
his
will
i
shall
report
it
so
i
pray

i
hope
your
lordship
thinks
not
him

soldier

very
valiant
approof

it
from
his
own
deliverance
and
by
other
warranted
testimony

dial
goes
not
true
i
took
this
lark
for
a
bunting
i
do
assure
you
my
lord
he
is
very
great
in
knowledge
and
accordingly
valiant
i
have
then
sinned
against
his
experience
and
transgressed
against
his
valour
and
my
state
that
way
is
dangerous
since
i
cannot
yet
find
in
my
heart
to
repent
here
he
comes
i
pray
you
make
us
friends
i
will
pursue
the
amity

things

treasure

orders
for
our
horses
and
tonight
when
i
should
take
possession
of
the
bride
end
ere
i
do
begin
a
good
traveller
is
something
at
the
latter
end
of
a
dinner
but
one
that
lies
three
thirds
and
uses
a
known
truth
to
pass
a
thousand
nothings
with
should
be
once
heard
and
thrice
beaten
god
save
you
captain
is
there
any
unkindness
between
my
lord
and
you
monsieur
i
know
not
how
i
have
deserved
to
run
into
my
lords
displeasure
you
have
made
shift
to
run
intot
boots
and
spurs
and
all
like
him
that
leaped
into
the
custard
and
out
of
it
youll
run
again
rather
than
suffer
question
for
your
residence
it
may
be
you
have
mistaken
him
my
lord
and
shall
do
so
ever
though
i
took
him
at
his
prayers
fare
you
well
my
lord
and
believe
this
of
me
there
can
be
no
kernel
in
this
light
nut
the
soul
of
this
man
is
his
clothes
trust
him
not
in
matter
of
heavy
consequence
i
have
kept
of
them
tame
and
know
their
natures
farewell
monsieur
i
have
spoken
better
of
you
than
you
have
or
will
to
deserve
at
my
hand
but
we
must
do
good
against
evil
an
idle
lord
i
swear
i
think
not
so
why
do
you
not
know
him
yes
i
do
know
him
well
and
common
speech
gives
him
a
worthy
pass
here
comes
my
clog
i
have
sir
as
i
was
commanded
from
you
spoke
with
the
king
and
have
procurd
his
leave
for
present
parting
only
he
desires
some
private
speech
with
you
i
shall
obey
his
will
you
must
not
marvel
helen
at
my
course
which
holds
not
colour
with
the
time
nor
does
the
ministration
and
required
office
on
my
particular
prepard
i
was
not
for
such
a
business
therefore
am
i
found
so
much
unsettled
this
drives
me
to
entreat
you
that
presently
you
take
your
way
for
home
and
rather
muse
than
ask
why
i
entreat
you
for
my
respects
are
better
than
they
seem
and
my
appointments
have
in
them
a
need
greater
than
shows
itself
at
the
first
view
to
you
that
know
them
not
this
to
my
mother
twill
be
two
days
ere
i
shall
see
you
so
i
leave
you
to
your
wisdom
sir
i
can
nothing
say
but
that
i
am
your
most
obedient
servant
come
come
no
more
of
that
and
ever
shall
with
true
observance
seek
to
eke
out
that
wherein
toward
me
my
homely
stars
have
faild
to
equal
my
great
fortune
let
that
go
my
haste
is
very
great
farewell
hie
home
pray
sir
your
pardon
well
what
would
you
say
i
am
not
worthy
of
the
wealth
i
owe
nor
dare
i
say
tis
mine
and
yet
it
is
but
like
a
timorous
thief
most
fain
would
steal
what
law
does
vouch
mine
own
what
would
you
have
something
and
scarce
so
much
nothing
indeed
i
would
not
tell
you
what
i
would
my
lord
faith
yes
strangers
and
foes
do
sunder
and
not
kiss
i
pray
you
stay
not
but
in
haste
to
horse
i
shall
not
break
your
bidding
good
my
lord
farewell
go
thou
toward
home
where
i
will
never
come
whilst
i
can
shake
my
sword
or
hear
the
drum
away
and
for
our
flight
bravely
coragio
so
that
from
point
to
point
now
have
you
heard
the
fundamental
reasons
of
this
war
whose
great
decision
hath
much
blood
let
forth
and
more
thirsts
after
holy
seems
the
quarrel
upon
your
graces
part
black
and
fearful
on
the
opposer
therefore
we
marvel
much
our
cousin
france
would
in
so
just
a
business
shut
his
bosom
against
our
borrowing
prayers
good
my
lord
the
reasons
of
our
state
i
cannot
yield
but
like
a
common
and
an
outward
man
that
the
great
figure
of
a
council
frames
by
selfunable
motion
therefore
dare
not
say
what
i
think
of
it
since
i
have
found
myself
in
my
incertain
grounds
to
fail
as
often
as
i
guessd
be
it
his
pleasure
but
i
am
sure
the
younger
of
our
nature
that
surfeit
on
their
ease
will
day
by
day
come
here
for
physic
welcome
shall
they
be
and
all
the
honours
that
can
fly
from
us
shall
on
them
settle
you
know
your
places
well
when
better
fall
for
your
avails
they
fell
tomorrow
to
the
field
it
hath
happened
all
as
i
would
have
had
it
save
that
he
comes
not
along
with
her
by
my
troth
i
take
my
young
lord
to
be
a
very
melancholy
man
by
what
observance
i
pray
you
why
he
will
look
upon
his
boot
and
sing
mend
the
ruff
and
sing
ask
questions
and
sing
pick
his
teeth
and
sing
i
know
a
man
that
had
this
trick
of
melancholy
sold
a
goodly
manor
for
a
song
let
me
see
what
he
writes
and
when
he
means
to
come
i
have
no
mind
to
isbel
since
i
was
at
court
our
old
ling
and
our
isbels
o
the
country
are
nothing
like
your
old
ling
and
your
isbels
o
the
court
the
brains
of
my
cupids
knocked
out
and
i
begin
to
love
as
an
old
man
loves
money
with
no
stomach
what
have
we
here
een
that
you
have
there
i
have
sent
you
a
daughterinlaw
she
hath
recovered
the
king
and
undone
me
i
have
wedded
her
not
bedded
her
and
sworn
to
make
the
not
eternal
you
shall
hear
i
am
ran
away
know
it
before
the
report
come
if
there
be
breadth
enough
in
the
world
i
will
hold
a
long
distance
my
duty
to
you
your
unfortunate
son
this
is
not
well
rash
and
unbridled
boy
to
fly
the
favours
of
so
good
a
king
to
pluck
his
indignation
on
thy
head
by
the
misprising
of
a
maid
too
virtuous
for
the
contempt
of
empire
o
madam
yonder
is
heavy
news
within
between
two
soldiers

the

not
consenting
to
nothing
in
france
until
he
have
no
wife
theres
nothing
here
that
is
too
good
for
him

which

to
have

alas
and
would
you
take
the
letter
of
her
might
you
not
know
she
would
do
as
she
has
done
by
sending
me
a
letter
read
it
again
i
am
saint
jaques
pilgrim
thither
gone
ambitious
love
hath
so
in
me
offended
that
barefoot
plod
i
the
cold
ground
upon
with
sainted
vow
my
faults
to
have
amended
write
write
that
from
the
bloody
course
of
war
my
dearest
master
your
dear
son
may
hie
bless
him
at
home
in
peace
whilst
i
from
far
his
name
with
zealous
fervour
sanctify
his
taken
labours
bid
him
me
forgive
i
his
despiteful
juno
sent
him
forth
from
courtly
friends
with
camping
foes
to
live
where
death
and
danger
dog
the
heels
of
worth
he
is
too
good
and
fair
for
death
and
me
whom
i
myself
embrace
to
set
him
free
ah
what
sharp
stings
are
in
her
mildest
words
rinaldo
you
did
never
lack
advice
so
much
as
letting
her
pass
so
had
i
spoke
with
her
i
could
have
well
diverted
her
intents
which
thus
she
hath
prevented
pardon
me
madam
if
i
had
given
you
this
at
overnight
she
might
have
been
oertaen
and
yet
she
writes
pursuit
would
be
but
vain
what
angel
shall
bless
this
unworthy
husband
he
cannot
thrive
unless
her
prayers
whom
heaven
delights
to
hear
and
loves
to
grant
reprieve
him
from
the
wrath
of
greatest
justice
write
write
rinaldo
to
this
unworthy
husband
of
his
wife
let
every
word
weigh
heavy
of
her
worth
that
he
does
weigh
too
light
my
greatest
grief
though
little
he
do
feel
it
set
down
sharply
dispatch
the
most
convenient
messenger
when
haply
he
shall
hear
that
she
is
gone
he
will
return
and
hope
i
may
that
she
hearing
so
much
will
speed
her
foot
again
led
hither
by
pure
love
which
of
them
both
is
dearest
to
me
i
have
no
skill
in
sense
to
make
distinction
provide
this
messenger
my
heart
is
heavy
and
mine
age
is
weak
grief
would
have
tears
and
sorrow
bids
me
speak
nay
come
for
if
they
do
approach
the
city
we
shall
lose
all
the
sight
they
say
the
french
count
has
done
most
honourable
service
it
is
reported
that
he
has
taken
their
greatest
commander
and
that
with
his
own
hand
he
slew
the
dukes
brother
we
have
lost
our
labour
they
are
gone
a
contrary
way
hark
you
may
know
by
their
trumpets
come
lets
return
again
and
suffice
ourselves
with
the
report
of
it
well
diana
take
heed
of
this
french
earl
the
honour
of
a
maid
is
her
name
and
no
legacy
is
so
rich
as
honesty
i
have
told
my
neighbour
how
you
have
been
solicited
by
a
gentleman
his
companion
i
know
that
knave
hang
him
one
parolles
a
filthy
officer
he
is
in
those
suggestions
for
the
young
earl
beware
of
them
diana
their
promises
enticements
oaths
tokens
and
all
these
engines
of
lust
are
not
the
things
they
go
under
many
a
maid
hath
been
seduced
by
them
and
the
misery
is
example
that
so
terrible
shows
in
the
wrack
of
maidenhood
cannot
for
all
that
dissuade
succession
but
that
they
are
limed
with
the
twigs
that
threaten
them
i
hope
i
need
not
to
advise
you
further
but
i
hope
your
own
grace
will
keep
you
where
you
are
though
there
were
no
further
danger
known
but
the
modesty
which
is
so
lost
you
shall
not
need
to
fear
me
i
hope
so
look
here
comes
a
pilgrim
i
know
she
will
lie
at
my
house
thither
they
send
one
another
ill
question
her
god
save
you
pilgrim
whither
are
you
bound
to
saint
jaques
le
grand
where
do
the
palmers
lodge
i
do
beseech
you
at
the
saint
francis
here
beside
the
port
is
this
the
way
ay
marry
ist
hark
you
they
come
this
way
if
you
will
tarry
holy
pilgrim
but
till
the
troops
come
by
i
will
conduct
you
where
you
shall
be
lodgd
the
rather
for
i
think
i
know
your
hostess
as
ample
as
myself
is
it
yourself
if
you
shall
please
so
pilgrim
i
thank
you
and
will
stay
upon
your
leisure
you
came
i
think
from
france
i
did
so
here
you
shall
see
a
countryman
of
yours
that
has
done
worthy
service
his
name
i
pray
you
the
count
rousillon
know
you
such
a
one
but
by
the
ear
that
hears
most
nobly
of
him
his
face
i
know
not
whatsoeer
he
is
hes
bravely
taken
here
he
stole
from
france
as
tis
reported
for
the
king
had
married
him
against
his
liking
think
you
it
is
so
ay
surely
mere
the
truth
i
know
his
lady
there
is
a
gentleman
that
serves
the
count
reports
but
coarsely
of
her
whats
his
name
monsieur
parolles
o
i
believe
with
him
in
argument
of
praise
or
to
the
worth
of
the
great
count
himself
she
is
too
mean
to
have
her
name
repeated
all
her
deserving
is
a
reserved
honesty
and
that
i
have
not
heard
examind
alas
poor
lady
tis
a
hard
bondage
to
become
the
wife
of
a
detesting
lord
ay
right
good
creature
wheresoeer
she
is
her
heart
weighs
sadly
this
young
maid
might
do
her
a
shrewd
turn
if
she
pleasd
how
do
you
mean
may
be
the
amorous
count
solicits
her
in
the
unlawful
purpose
he
does
indeed
and
brokes
with
all
that
can
in
such
a
suit
corrupt
the
tender
honour
of
a
maid
but
she
is
armd
for
him
and
keeps
her
guard
in
honestest
defence
the
gods
forbid
else
so
now
they
come
that
is
antonio
the
dukes
eldest
son

much
goodlier

more
in
your
respect
on
my
life
my
lord
a
bubble
do
you
think
i
am
so
far
deceived
in
him
believe
it
my
lord
in
mine
own
direct
knowledge
without
any
malice
but
to
speak
of
him
as
my
kinsman
hes
a
most
notable
coward
an
infinite
and
endless
liar
an
hourly
promisebreaker
the
owner
of
no
one
good
quality
worthy
your
lordships
entertainment
it
were
fit
you
knew
him
lest
reposing
too
far
in
his
virtue
which
he
hath
not
he
might
at
some
great
and
trusty
business
in
a
main
danger
fail
you
i
would
i
knew
in
what
particular
action
to
try
him
none
better
than
to
let
him
fetch
off
his
drum
which
you
hear
him
so
confidently
undertake
to
do
i
with
a
troop
of
florentines
will
suddenly
surprise
him
such
i
will
have
whom
i
am
sure
he
knows
not
from
the
enemy
we
will
bind
and
hood
wink
him
so
that
he
shall
suppose
no
other
but
that
he
is
carried
into
the
leaguer
of
the
adversaries
when
we
bring
him
to
our
own
tents
be
but
your
lordship
present
at
his
examination
if
he
do
not
for
the
promise
of
his
life
and
in
the
highest
compulsion
of
base
fear
offer
to
betray
you
and
deliver
all
the
intelligence
in
his
power
against
you
and
that
with
the
divine
forfeit
of
his
soul
upon
oath
never
trust
my
judgment
in
anything
o
for
the
love
of
laughter
let
him
fetch
his
drum
he
says
he
has
a
stratagem
fort
when
your
lordship
sees
the
bottom
of
his
success
int
and
to
what
metal
this
counterfeit
lump
of
ore
will
be
melted
if
you
give
him
not
john
drums
entertainment
your
inclining
cannot
be
removed
here
he
comes
o
for
the
love
of
laughter
hinder
not
the
honour
of
his
design
let
him
fetch
off
his
drum
in
any
hand
how
now
monsieur
this
drum
sticks
sorely
in
your
disposition
a
pox
ont
let
it
go
tis
but
a
drum
but
a
drum
ist
but
a
drum
a
drum
so
lost
there
was
excellent
command
to
charge
in
with
our
horse
upon
our
own
wings
and
to
rend
our
own
soldiers
that
was
not
to
be
blamed
in
the
command
of
the
service
it
was
a
disaster
of
war
that
c
sar
himself
could
not
have
prevented
if
he
had
been
there
to
command
well
we
cannot
greatly
condemn
our
success
some
dishonour
we
had
in
the
loss
of
that
drum
but
it
is
not
to
be
recovered
it
might
have
been
recovered
it
might
but
it
is
not
now
it
is
to
be
recovered
but
that
the
merit
of
service
is
seldom
attributed
to
the
true
and
exact
performer
i
would
have
that
drum
or
another
or
hic
jacet
why
if
you
have
a
stomach
tot
monsieur
if
you
think
your
mystery
in
stratagem
can
bring
this
instrument
of
honour
again
into
its
native
quarter
be
magnanimous
in
the
enterprise
and
go
on
i
will
grace
the
attempt
for
a
worthy
exploit
if
you
speed
well
in
it
the
duke
shall
both
speak
of
it
and
extend
to
you
what
further
becomes
his
greatness
even
to
the
utmost
syllable
of
your
worthiness
by
the
hand
of
a
soldier
i
will
undertake
it
but
you
must
not
now
slumber
in
it
ill
about
it
this
evening
and
i
will
presently
pen
down
my
dilemmas
encourage
myself
in
my
certainty
put
myself
into
my
mortal
preparation
and
by
midnight
look
to
hear
further
from
me
may
i
be
bold
to
acquaint
his
grace
you
are
gone
about
it
i
know
not
what
the
success
will
be
my
lord
but
the
attempt
i
vow
i
know
thourt
valiant
and
to
the
possibility
of
thy
soldiership
will
subscribe
for
thee
farewell
i
love
not
many
words
no
more
than
a
fish
loves
water
is
not
this
a
strange
fellow
my
lord
that
so
confidently
seems
to
undertake
this
business
which
he
knows
is
not
to
be
done
damns
himself
to
do
and
dares
better
be
damned
than
to
dot
you
do
not
know
him
my
lord
as
we
do
certain
it
is
that
he
will
steal
himself
into
a
mans
favour
and
for
a
week
escape
a
great
deal
of
discoveries
but
when
you
find
him
out
you
have
him
ever
after
why
do
you
think
he
will
make
no
deed
at
all
of
this
that
so
seriously
he
does
address
himself
unto
none
in
the
world
but
return
with
an
invention
and
clap
upon
you
two
or
three
probable
lies
but
we
have
almost
embossed
him
you
shall
see
his
fall
tonight
for
indeed
he
is
not
for
your
lordships
respect
well
make
you
some
sport
with
the
fox
ere
we
case

was
first
smoked
by
the
old
lord

when
his
disguise
and
he
is
parted

me
what
a
sprat

night

be
caught

brother

lordship

i
lead
you
to
the
house
and

the
lass

spoke
of
but
you
say
shes
honest
thats
all
the
fault
i
spoke
with
her
but
once
and
found
her
wondrous
cold
but
i
sent
to
her
by
this
same
coxcomb
that
we
have
i
the
wind
tokens
and
letters
which
she
did
resend
and
this
is
all
i
have
done
shes
a
fair
creature
will
you
go
see
her
with
all
my
heart
my
lord
if
you
misdoubt
me
that
i
am
not
she
i
know
not
how
i
shall
assure
you
further
but
i
shall
lose
the
grounds
i
work
upon
though
my
estate
be
falln
i
was
well
born
nothing
acquainted
with
these
businesses
and
would
not
put
my
reputation
now
in
any
staining
act
nor
would
i
wish
you
first
give
me
trust
the
county
is
my
husband
and
what
to
your
sworn
counsel
i
have
spoken
is
so
from
word
to
word
and
then
you
cannot
by
the
good
aid
that
i
of
you
shall
borrow
err
in
bestowing
it
i
should
believe
you
for
you
have
showd
me
that
which
well
approves
youre
great
in
fortune
take
this
purse
of
gold
and
let
me
buy
your
friendly
help
thus
far
which
i
will
overpay
and
pay
again
when
i
have
found
it
the
county
woos
your
daughter
lays
down
his
wanton
siege
before
her
beauty
resolvd
to
carry
her
let
her
in
fine
consent
as
well
direct
her
how
tis
best
to
bear
it
now
his
important
blood
will
nought
deny
that
shell
demand
a
ring
the
county
wears
that
down
ward
hath
succeeded
in
his
house
from
son
to
son
some
four
or
five
descents
since
the
first
father
wore
it
this
ring
he
holds
in
most
rich
choice
yet
in
his
idle
fire
to
buy
his
will
it
would
not
seem
too
dear
howeer
repented
after
now
i
see
the
bottom
of
your
purpose
you
see
it
lawful
then
it
is
no
more
but
that
your
daughter
ere
she
seems
as
won
desires
this
ring
appoints
him
an
encounter
in
fine
delivers
me
to
fill
the
time
herself
most
chastely
absent
after
this
to
marry
her
ill
add
three
thousand
crowns
to
what
is
past
already
i
have
yielded
instruct
my
daughter
how
she
shall
persever
that
time
and
place
with
this
deceit
so
lawful
may
prove
coherent
every
night
he
comes
with
musics
of
all
sorts
and
songs
composd
to
her
unworthiness
it
nothing
steads
us
to
chide
him
from
our
eaves
for
he
persists
as
if
his
life
lay
ont
why
then
tonight
let
us
assay
our
plot
which
if
it
speed
is
wicked
meaning
in
a
lawful
deed
and
lawful
meaning
in
a
lawful
act
where
both
not
sin
and
yet
a
sinful
fact
but
lets
about
it
he
can
come
no
other
way
but
by
this
hedgecorner
when
you
sally
upon
him
speak
what
terrible
language
you
will
though
you
understand
it
not
yourselves
no
matter
for
we
must
not
seem
to
understand
him
unless
some
one
among
us
whom
we
must
produce
for
an
interpreter
good
captain
let
me
be
the
interpreter
art
not
acquainted
with
him
knows
he
not
thy
voice
no
sir
i
warrant
you
but
what
linseywoolsey
hast
thou
to
speak
to
us
again
even
such
as
you
speak
to
me
he
must
think
us
some
band
of
strangers
i
the
adversarys
entertainment
now
he
hath
a
smack
of
all
neighbouring
languages
therefore
we
must
every
one
be
a
man
of
his
own
fancy
not
to
know
what
we
speak
one
to
another
so
we
seem
to
know
is
to
know
straight
our
purpose
choughs
language
gabble
enough
and
good
enough
as
for
you
interpreter
you
must
seem
very
politic
but
couch
ho
here
he
comes
to
beguile
two
hours
in
a
sleep
and
then
to
return
and
swear
the
lies
he
forges
ten
oclock
within
these
three
hours
twill
be
time
enough
to
go
home
what
shall
i
say
i
have
done
it
must
be
a
very
plausive
invention
that
carries
it
they
begin
to
smoke
me
and
disgraces
have
of
late
knocked
too
often
at
my
door
i
find
my
tongue
is
too
foolhardy
but
my
heart
hath
the
fear
of
mars
before
it
and
of
his
creatures
not
daring
the
reports
of
my
tongue
this
is
the
first
truth
that
eer
thine
own
tongue
was
guilty
of
what
the
devil
should
move
me
to
undertake
the
recovery
of
this
drum
being
not
ignorant
of
the
impossibility
and
knowing
i
had
no
such
purpose
i
must
give
myself
some
hurts
and
say
i
got
them
in
exploit
yet
slight
ones
will
not
carry
it
they
will
say
came
you
off
with
so
little
and
great
ones
i
dare
not
give
wherefore
whats
the
instance
tongue
i
must
put
you
into
a

mouth
and
buy
myself
another

if
you
prattle
me
into
these
perils
is
it
possible
he
should
know
what
he
is
and
be
that
he
is
i
would
the
cutting
of
my
garments
would
serve
the
turn

the
breaking
of
my
spanish

we
cannot
afford
you

of
my

to

they
told
me
that
your
name
was
fontibell
no
my
good
lord
diana
titled
goddess
and
worth
it
with
addition
but
fair
soul
in
your
fine
frame
hath
love
no
quality
if
the
quick
fire
of
youth
light
not
your
mind
you
are
no
maiden
but
a
monument
when
you
are
dead
you
should
be
such
a
one
as
you
are
now
for
you
are
cold
and
stern
and
now
you
should
be
as
your
mother
was
when
your
sweet
self
was
got
she
then
was
honest
so
should
you
be
no
my
mother
did
but
duty
such
my
lord
as
you
owe
to
your
wife
no
more
o
that
i
prithee
do
not
strive
against
my
vows
i
was
compelld
to
her
but
i
love
thee
by
loves
own
sweet
constraint
and
will
for
ever
do
thee
all
rights
of
service
ay
so
you
serve
us
till
we
serve
you
but
when
you
have
our
roses
you
barely
leave
our
thorns
to
prick
ourselves
and
mock
us
with
our
bareness
how
have
i
sworn
tis
not
the
many
oaths
that
make
the
truth
but
the
plain
single
vow
that
is
vowd
true
what
is
not
holy
that
we
swear
not
by
but
take
the
highest
to
witness
then
pray
you
tell
me
if
i
should
swear
by
gods
great
attributes
i
lovd
you
dearly
would
you
believe
my
oaths
when
i
did
love
you
ill
this
has
no
holding
to
swear
by
him
whom
i
protest
to
love
that
i
will
work
against
him
therefore
your
oaths
are
words
and
poor
conditions
but
unseald
at
least
in
my
opinion
change
it
change
it
be
not
so
holycruel
love
is
holy
and
my
integrity
neer
knew
the
crafts
that
you
do
charge
men
with
stand
no
more
off
but
give
thyself
unto
my
sick
desires
who
then
recover
say
thou
art
mine
and
ever
my
love
as
it
begins
shall
so
persever
i
see
that
men
make
ropes
in
such
a
scarr
that
well
forsake
ourselves
give
me
that
ring
ill
lend
it
thee
my
dear
but
have
no
power
to
give
it
from
me
will
you
not
my
lord
it
is
an
honour
longing
to
our
house
bequeathed
down
from
many
ancestors
which
were
the
greatest
obloquy
i
the
world
in
me
to
lose
mine
honours
such
a
ring
my
chastitys
the
jewel
of
our
house
bequeathed
down
from
many
ancestors
which
were
the
greatest
obloquy
i
the
world
in
me
to
lose
thus
your
own
proper
wisdom
brings
in
the
champion
honour
on
my
part
against
your
vain
assault
here
take
my
ring
my
house
mine
honour
yea
my
life
be
thine
and
ill
be
bid
by
thee
when
midnight
comes
knock
at
my
chamberwindow
ill
order
take
my
mother
shall
not
hear
now
will
i
charge
you
in
the
band
of
truth
when
you
have
conquerd
my
yet
maiden
bed
remain
there
but
an
hour
nor
speak
to
me
my
reasons
are
most
strong
and
you
shall
know
them
when
back
again
this
ring
shall
be
deliverd
and
on
your
finger
in
the
night
ill
put
another
ring
that
what
in
time
proceeds
may
token
to
the
future
our
past
deeds
adieu
till
then
then
fail
not
you
have
won
a
wife
of
me
though
there
my
hope
be
done
a
heaven
on
earth
i
have
won
by
wooing
thee
for
which
live
long
to
thank
both
heaven
and
me
you
may
so
in
the
end
my
mother
told
me
just
how
he
would
woo
as
if
she
sat
in
s
heart
she
says
all
men
have
the
like
oaths
he
had
sworn
to
marry
me
when
his
wifes
dead
therefore
ill
lie
with
him
when
i
am
buried
since
frenchmen
are
so
braid
marry
that
will
i
live
and
die
a
maid
only
in
this
disguise
i
thinkt
no
sin
to
cozen
him
that
would
unjustly
win
you
have
not
given
him
his
mothers
letter
i
have
delivered
it
an
hour
since
there
is
something
int
that
stings
his
nature
for
on
the
reading
it
he
changed
almost
into
another
man
he
has
much
worthy
blame
laid
upon
him
for
shaking
off
so
good
a
wife
and
so
sweet
a
lady
especially
he
hath
incurred
the
everlasting
displeasure
of
the
king
who
had
even
tuned
his
bounty
to
sing
happiness
to
him
i
will
tell
you
a
thing
but
you
shall
let
it
dwell
darkly
with
you
when
you
have
spoken
it
tis
dead
and
i
am
the
grave
of
it
he
hath
perverted
a
young
gentlewoman
here
in
florence
of
a
most
chaste
renown
and
this
night
he
fleshes
his
will
in
the
spoil
of
her
honour
he
hath
given
her
his
monumental
ring
and
thinks
himself
made
in
the
unchaste
composition
now
god
delay
our
rebellion
as
we
are
ourselves
what
things
are
we
merely
our
own
traitors
and
as
in
the
common
course
of
all
treasons
we
still
see
them
reveal
themselves
till
they
attain
to
their
abhorred
ends
so
he
that
in
this
action
contrives
against
his
own
nobility
in
his
proper
stream
oerflows
himself
is
it
not
most
damnable
in
us
to
be
trumpeters
of
our
unlawful
intents
we
shall
not
then
have
his
company
tonight
not
till
after
midnight
for
he
is
dieted
to
his
hour
that
approaches
apace
i
would
gladly
have
him
see
his
company
anatomized
that
he
might
take
a
measure
of
his
own
judgments
wherein
so
curiously
he
had
set
this
counterfeit
we
will
not
meddle
with
him
till
he
come
for
his
presence
must
be
the
whip
of
the
other
in
the
meantime
what
near
you
of
these
wars
i
hear
there
is
an
overture
of
peace
nay
i
assure
you
a
peace
concluded
what
will
count
rousillon
do
then
will
he
travel
higher
or
return
again
into
france
i
perceive
by
this
demand
you
are
not
altogether
of
his
council
let
it
be
forbid
sir
so
should
i
be
a
great
deal
of
his
act
sir
his
wife
some
two
months
since
fled
from
his
house
her
pretence
is
a
pilgrimage
to
saint
jaques
le
grand
which
holy
undertaking
with
most
austere
sanctimony
she
accomplished
and
there
residing
the
tenderness
of
her
nature
became
as
a
prey
to
her
grief
in
fine
made
a
groan
of
her
last
breath
and
now
she
sings
in
heaven
how
is
this
justified
the
stronger
part
of
it
by
her
own
letters
which
make
her
story
true
even
to
the
point
of
her
death
her
death
itself
which
could
not
be
her
office
to
say
is
come
was
faithfully
confirmed
by
the
rector
of
the
place
hath
the
count
all
this
intelligence
ay
and
the
particular
confirmations
point
from
point
to
the
full
arming
of
the
verity
i
am
heartily
sorry
that
hell
be
glad
of
this
how
mightily
sometimes
we
make
us
comforts
of
our
losses
and
how
mightily
some
other
times
we
drown
our
gain
in
tears
the
great
dignity
that
his
valour
hath
here
acquired
for
him
shall
at
home
be
encountered
with
a
shame
as
ample
the
web
of
our
life
is
of
a
mingled
yarn
good
and
ill
together
our
virtues
would
be
proud
if
our
faults
whipped
them
not
and
our
crimes
would
despair
if
they
were
not
cherished
by
our
virtues
how
now
wheres
your
master
he
met
the
duke
in
the
street
sir
of
whom
he
hath
taken
a
solemn
leave
his
lordship
will
next
morning
for
france
the
duke
hath
offered
him
letters
of
commendations
to
the
king
they
shall
be
no
more
than
needful
there
if
they
were
more
than
they
can
commend
they
cannot
be
too
sweet
for
the
kings
tartness
heres
his
lordship
now
how
now
my
lord
ist
not
after
midnight
i
have
tonight
dispatched
sixteen
businesses
a
months
length
apiece
by
an
abstract
of
success
i
have
conged
with
the
duke
done
my
adieu
with
his
nearest
buried
a
wife
mourned
for
her
writ

a
was
a
botchers
prentice
in
paris
from
whence
he
was
whipped
for
getting
the
shrieves
fool
with
child
a
dumb
innocent
that

not
say
him
nay
nay
by
your
leave
hold

the
duke

but
a
poor
officer
of
mine
and
writ
to
me
this
other
day
to
turn
him
out
o
the
band
i
think
i
have
his
letter
in
my
pocket

well
search
in
good
sadness
i
do
not
know
either
it
is
there
or
it
is
upon
a
file
with
the
dukes
other
letters
in
my
tent
here
tis
heres
a
paper
shall
i
read
it
to
you
i
do
not
know
if
it
be
it
or
no
our
interpreter
does
it
well
excellently
dian
the
counts
a
fool
and
full
of
gold
that
is
not
the
dukes
letter
sir
that
is
an
advertisement
to
a
proper
maid
in
florence
one
diana
to
take
heed
of
the
allurement
of
one
count
rousillon
a
foolish
idle
boy
but
for
all
that
very
ruttish
i
pray
you
sir
put
it
up
again
nay
ill
read
it
first
by
your
favour
my
meaning
int
i
protest
was
very
honest
in
the
behalf
of
the
maid
for
i
knew
the
young
count
to
be
a
dangerous
and
lascivious
boy
who
is
a
whale
to
virginity
and
devours
up
all
the
fry
it
finds
damnable
bothsides
rogue
when
he
swears
oaths
bid
him
drop
gold
and
take
it
after
he
scores
he
never
pays
the
score
half
won
is
match
well
made
match
and
well
make
it
he
neer
pays
afterdebts
take
it
before
and
say
a
soldier
dian
told
thee
this
men
are
to
mell
with
boys
are
not
to
kiss
for
count
of
this
the
counts
a
fool
i
know
it
who
pays
before
but
not
when
he
does
owe
it
thine
as
he
vowd
to
thee
in
thine
ear
he
shall
be
whipped
through
the
army
with
this
rime
ins
forehead
this
is
your
devoted
friend
sir
the
manifold
linguist
and
the
armipotent
soldier
i
could
endure
anything
before
but
a
cat
and
now
hes
a
cat
to
me
i
perceive
sir
by
our
generals
looks
we
shall
be
fain
to
hang
you
my
life
sir
in
any
case
not
that
i
am
afraid
to
die
but
that
my
offences
being
many
i
would
repent
out
the
remainder
of
nature
let
me
live
sir
in
a
dungeon
i
the
stocks
or
anywhere
so
i
may
live
well
see
what
may
be
done
so
you
confess
freely
therefore
once
more
to
this
captain
dumain
you
have
answered
to
his
reputation
with
the
duke
and
to
his
valour
what
is
his
honesty
he
will
steal
sir
an
egg
out
of
a
cloister
for
rapes
and
ravishments
he
parallels
nessus
he
professes
not
keeping
of
oaths
in
breaking
em
he
is
stronger
than
hercules
he
will
lie
sir
with
such
volubility
that
you
would
think
truth
were
a
fool
drunkenness
is
his
best
virtue
for
he
will
be
swinedrunk
and
in
his
sleep
he
does
little
harm
save
to
his
bedclothes
about
him
but
they
know
his
conditions
and
lay
him
in
straw
i
have
but
little
more
to
say
sir
of
his
honesty
he
has
everything
that
an
honest
man
should
not
have
what
an
honest
man
should
have
he
has
nothing
i
begin
to
love
him
for
this
for
this
description
of
thine
honesty
a
pox
upon
him
for
me
he
is
more
and
more
a
cat
what
say
you
to
his
expertness
in
war
faith
sir
he
has
led
the
drum
before
the
english
tragedians
to
belie
him
i
will
not
and
more
of
his
soldiership
i
know
not
except
in
that
country
he
had
the
honour
to
be
the
officer
at
a
place
there
called
mileend
to
instruct
for
the
doubling
of
files
i
would
do
the
man
what
honour
i
can
but
of
this
i
am
not
certain
he
hath
outvillained
villany
so
far
that
the
rarity
redeems
him
a
pox
on
him
hes
a
cat
still
his
qualities
being
at
this
poor
price
i
need
not
ask
you
if
gold
will
corrupt
him
to
revolt
sir
for
a
cardecu
he
will
sell
the
feesimple
of
his
salvation
the
inheritance
of
it
and
cut
the
entail
from
all
remainders
and
a
perpetual
succession
for
it
perpetually
whats
his
brother
the
other
captain
dumain
why
does
he
ask
him
or
me
whats
he
een
a
crow
o
the
same
nest
not
altogether
so
great
as
the
first
in
goodness
but
greater
a
great
deal
in
evil
he
excels
his
brother
for
a
coward
yet
his
brother
is
reputed
one
of
the
best
that
is
in
a
retreat
he
outruns
any
lackey
marry
in
coming
on
he
has
the
cramp
if
your
life
be
saved
will
you
undertake
to
betray
the
florentine
ay
and
the
captain
of
his
horse
count
rousillon
ill
whisper
with
the
general
and
know
his
pleasure
ill
no
more
drumming
a
plague
of
all
drums
only
to
seem
to
deserve
well
and
to
beguile
the
supposition
of
that
lascivious
young
boy
the
count
have
i
run
into
this
danger
yet
who
would
have
suspected
an
ambush
where
i
was
taken
there
is
no
remedy
sir
but
you
must
die
the
general
says
you
that
have
so
traitorously
discovered
the
secrets
of
your
army
and
made
such
pestiferous
reports
of
men
very
nobly
held
can
serve
the
world
for
no
honest
use
therefore
you
must
die

heaven
hath
brought

up
to
be
your
daughters
dower
as
it
hath
fated
her
to
be
my
motive
and
helper
to
a
husband
but
o
strange
men
that
can
such
sweet
use
make
of
what
they
hate
when
saucy
trusting
of
the
cozend
thoughts
defiles
the
pitchy
night
so
lust
doth
play
with
what
it
loathes
for
that
which

more
of
this
hereafter

your

had
been
alive
at

any
tricks

put
any
tricks
upon
em
sir
they
shall
be
jades
tricks
which
are
their
own
right
by
the
law
of
nature
a
shrewd
knave
and
an
unhappy
so
he
is
my
lord
thats
gone
made
himself
much
sport
out
of
him
by
his
authority
he
remains
here
which
he
thinks
is
a
patent
for
his
sauciness
and
indeed
he
has
no
pace
but
runs
where
he
will
i
like
him
well
tis
not
amiss
and
i
was
about
to
tell
you
since
i
heard
of
the
good
ladys
death
and
that
my
lord
your
son
was
upon
his
return
home
i
moved
the
king
my
master
to
speak
in
the
behalf
of
my
daughter
which
in
the
minority
of
them
both
his
majesty
out
of
a
selfgracious
remembrance
did
first
propose
his
highness
hath
promised
me
to
do
it
and
to
stop
up
the
displeasure
he
hath
conceived
against
your
son
there
is
no
fitter
matter
how
does
your
ladyship
like
it
with
very
much
content

lord

i
wish
it
happily
effected
his
highness

post
from
marseilles
of
as
able
body
as
when
he
numbered
thirty
he
will
be
here
tomorrow
or
i
am
deceived
by
him
that
in
such
intelligence
hath
seldom
failed

rejoices
me
that
i
hope
i
shall
see
him
ere
i
die

be
here
tonight

shall
beseech
your
lordship

your
honourable
privilege

have
made

bold
charter

yonders
my
lord
your
son
with
a
patch
of
velvet
ons
face
whether
there
be
a
scar
under
it
or
no
the
velvet
knows
but
tis
a
goodly
patch
of
velvet
his
left
cheek
is
a
cheek
of
two
pile
and
a
half
but
his
right
cheek
is
worn
bare
a
scar
nobly
got
or
a
noble
scar
is
a
good
livery
of
honour
so
belike
is
that
but
it
is
your
carbonadoed
face

you
we
lost
a
jewel
of
her
and
our
esteem
was
made
much
poorer
by
it
but
your
son
as
mad
in
folly
lackd
the
sense
to
know
her
estimation
home
tis
past
my
liege
and
i
beseech
your
majesty
to
make
it
natural
rebellion
done
i
the
blaze
of
youth
when
oil
and
fire
too
strong
for
reasons
force
oerbears
it
and
burns
on
my
honourd
lady
i
have
forgiven
and
forgotten
all
though
my
revenges
were
high
bent
upon
him
and
watchd
the
time
to
shoot
this
i
must
say
but
first
i
beg
my
pardon
the
young
lord
did
to
his
majesty
his
mother
and
his
lady
offence
of
mighty
note
but
to
himself
the
greatest
wrong
of
all
he
lost
a
wife
whose
beauty
did
astonish
the
survey
of
richest
eyes
whose
words
all
ears
took
captive
whose
dear
perfection
hearts
that
scornd
to
serve
humbly
calld
mistress
praising
what
is
lost
makes
the
remembrance
dear
well
call
him
hither
we
are
reconcild
and
the
first
view
shall
kill
all
repetition
let
him
not
ask
our
pardon
the
nature
of
his
great
offence
is
dead
and
deeper
than
oblivion
we
do
bury
the
incensing
relics
of
it
let
him
approach
a
stranger
no
offender
and
inform
him
so
tis
our
will
he
should
i
shall
my
liege
what
says
he
to
your
daughter
have
you
spoke
all
that
he
is
hath
reference
to
your
highness
then
shall
we
have
a
match
i
have
letters
sent
me
that
set
him
high
in
fame
he
looks
well
ont
i
am
not
a
day
of
season
for
thou
mayst
see
a
sunshine
and
a
hail
in
me
at
once
but
to
the
brightest
beams
distracted
clouds
give
way
so
stand
thou
forth
the
time
is
fair
again
my
highrepented
blames
dear
sovereign
pardon
to
me
all
is
whole
not
one
word
more
of
the
consumed
time
lets
take
the
instant
by
the
forward
top
for
we
are
old
and
on
our
quickst
decrees
the
inaudible
and
noiseless
foot
of
time
steals
ere
we
can
effect
them
you
remember
the
daughter
of
this
lord
admiringly
my
liege
at
first
i
stuck
my
choice
upon
her
ere
my
heart
durst
make
too
bold
a
herald
of
my
tongue
where
the
impression
of
mine
eye
infixing
contempt
his
scornful
perspective
did
lend
me
which
warpd
the
line
of
every
other
favour
scornd
a
fair
colour
or
expressd
it
stolen
extended
or
contracted
all
proportions
to
a
most
hideous
object
thence
it
came
that
she
whom
all
men
praisd
and
whom
myself
since
i
have
lost
have
lovd
was
in
mine
eye
the
dust
that
did
offend
it
well
excusd
that
thou
didst
love
her
strikes
some
scores
away
from
the
great
compt
but
love
that
comes
too
late
like
a
remorseful
pardon
slowly
carried
to
the
great
sender
turns
a
sour
offence
crying
thats
good
thats
gone
our
rasher
faults
make
trivial
price
of
serious
things
we
have
not
knowing
them
until
we
know
their
grave
oft
our
displeasures
to
ourselves
unjust
destroy
our
friends
and
after
weep
their
dust
our
own
love
waking
cries
to
see
whats
done
while
shameful
hate
sleeps
out
the
afternoon
be
this
sweet
helens
knell
and
now
forget
her
send
forth
your
amorous
token
for
fair
maudlin
the
main
consents
are
had
and
here
well
stay
to
see
our
widowers
second
marriageday
which
better
than
the
first
o
dear
heaven
bless
or
ere
they
meet
in
me
o
nature
cesse
come
on
my
son
in
whom
my
houses
name
must
be
digested
give
a
favour
from
you
to
sparkle
in
the
spirits
of
my
daughter
that
she
may
quickly
come
and
every
hair
thats
ont
helen
thats
dead
was
a
sweet
creature
such
a
ring
as
this
the
last
that
eer
i
took
her
leave
at
court
i
saw
upon
her
finger
hers
it
was
not
now
pray
you
let
me
see
it
for
mine
eye
while
i
was
speaking
oft
was
fastend
tot
this
ring
was
mine
and
when
i
gave
it
helen
i
bade
her
if
her
fortunes
ever
stood
necessitied
to
help
that
by
this
token
i
would
relieve
her
had
you
that
craft
to
reave
her
of
what
should
stead
her
most
my
gracious
sovereign
howeer
it
pleases
you
to
take
it
so
the
ring
was
never
hers
son
on
my
life
i
have
seen
her
wear
it
and
she
reckond
it
at
her
lifes
rate
i
am
sure
i
saw
her
wear
it
you
are
deceivd
my
lord
she
never
saw
it
in
florence
was
it
from
a
casement
thrown
me
wrappd
in
a
paper
which
containd
the
name
of
her
that
threw
it
noble
she
was
and
thought
i
stood
engagd
but
when
i
had
subscribd
to
mine
own
fortune
and
informd
her
fully
i
could
not
answer
in
that
course
of
honour
as
she
had
made
the
overture
she
ceasd
in
heavy
satisfaction
and
would
never
receive
the
ring
again
plutus
himself
that
knows
the
tinct
and
multiplying
medicine
hath
not
in
natures
mystery
more
science
than
i
have
in
this
ring
twas
mine
twas
helens
whoever
gave
it
you
then
if
you
know
that
you
are
well
acquainted
with
yourself
confess
twas
hers
and
by
what
rough
enforcement
you
got
it
from
her
she
calld
the
saints
to
surety
that
she
would
never
put
it
from
her
finger
unless
she
gave
it
to
yourself
in
bed
where
you
have
never
come
or
sent
it
us
upon
her
great
disaster
she
never
saw
it
thou
speakst
it
falsely
as
i
love
mine
honour
and
makst
conjectural
fears
to
come
into
me
which
i
would
fain
shut
out
if
it
should
prove
that
thou
art
so
inhuman
twill
not
prove
so
and
yet
i
know
not
thou
didst
hate
her
deadly
and
she
is
dead
which
nothing
but
to
close
her
eyes
myself
could
win
me
to
believe
more
than
to
see
this
ring
take
him
away
my
forepast
proofs
howeer
the
matter
fall
shall
tax
my
fears
of
little
vanity
having
vainly
feard
too
little
away
with
him
well
sift
this
matter
further
if
you
shall
prove
this
ring
was
ever
hers
you
shall
as
easy
prove
that
i
husbanded
her
bed
in
florence
where
yet
she
never
was
i
am
wrappd
in
dismal
thinkings
gracious
sovereign
whether
i
have
been
to
blame
or
no
i
know
not
heres
a
petition
from
a
florentine
who
hath
for
four
or
five
removes
come
short
to
tender
it
herself
i
undertook
it
vanquishd
thereto
by
the
fair
grace
and
speech
of
the
poor
suppliant
who
by
this
i
know
is
here
attending
her
business
looks
in
her
with
an
importing
visage
and
she
told
me
in
a
sweet
verbal
brief
it
did
concern
your
highness
with
herself
upon
his
many
protestations
to
marry
me
when
his
wife
was
dead

blush
to
say
it

won
me
now

the
count

widower
his
vows
are
forfeited
to
me
and
my
honours

no
leave
and

follow
him
to
his
country

justice

wretched
florentine
derived
from
the
ancient
capilet

therefore

how
far
i
may
be
pitied
i
am
her
mother
sir
whose
age
and

under
this
complaint
we

and

shall
cease
without
your
remedy

you
know
these
women
my
lord

so
strange
upon
your
wife

that

none
your
reputation

too
short
for
my
daughter

are
no
husband
for
her
my
lord
this
is
a
fond
and
desperate
creature
whom
sometime
i
have
laughd
with
let
your
highness
lay
a
more
noble
thought
upon
mine
honour
than
for
to
think
that
i
would
sink
it
here
sir
for
my
thoughts
you
have
them
ill
to
friend
till
your
deeds
gain
them

thought

him
upon
his
oath
if
he
does
think
he
had
not
my
virginity

high
respect

to
a
commoner
o
the
camp

whose

i
the
wanton
way
of
youth
she
knew
her
distance
and
did
angle
for
me
madding
my
eagerness
with
her
restraint
as
all
impediments
in
fancys
course
are
motives
of
more
fancy
and
in
fine
her
infinite
cunning
with
her
modern
grace
subdued
me
to
her
rate
she
got
the
ring

i
had
that
which
any
inferior
might
at
marketprice

out
of
a
casement
i
have
spoke
the
truth
my
lord
i
do
confess
the
ring
was
hers
you
boggle
shrewdly
every
feather
starts
you
is
this
the
man
you
speak
of
ay
my
lord
tell
me
sirrah
but
tell
me
true
i
charge
you
not
fearing
the
displeasure
of
your
master
which
on
your
just
proceeding
ill
keep
off
by
him
and
by
this
woman
here
what
know
you
so
please
your
majesty
my
master
hath
been
an
honourable
gentleman
tricks
he
hath
had
in
him
which
gentlemen
have
come
come
to
the
purpose
did
he
love
this
woman
faith
sir
he
did
love
her
but
how
how
i
pray
you
he
did
love
her
sir
as
a
gentleman
loves
a
woman
how
is
that
he
loved
her
sir
and
loved
her
not
as
thou
art
a
knave
and
no
knave
what
an
equivocal
companion
is
this
i
am
a
poor
man
and
at
your
majestys
command
he
is
a
good
drum
my
lord
but
a
naughty
orator
do
you
know
he
promised
me
marriage
faith
i
know
more
than
ill
speak
but
wilt
thou
not
speak
all
thou
knowest
yes
so
please
your
majesty
i
did
go
between
them
as
i
said
but
more
than
that
he
loved
her
for
indeed
he
was
mad
for
her
and
talked
of
satan
and
of
limbo
and
of
furies
and
i
know
not
what
yet
i
was
in
that
credit
with
them
at
that
time
that
i
knew
of
their
going
to
bed
and
of
other
motions
as
promising
her
marriage
and
things
which
would
derive
me
ill
will
to
speak
of
therefore
i
will
not
speak
what
i
know
thou
hast
spoken
all
already
unless
thou
canst
say
they
are
married
but
thou
art
too
fine
in
thy
evidence
therefore
stand
aside
this
ring

say
was
yours

did
you
buy
it
or
who

while
because

i
remember
adam
it
was
upon
this
fashion
bequeathed
me
by
will
but
poor
a
thousand
crowns
and
as
thou
sayest
charged
my
brother
on
his
blessing
to
breed
me
well
and
there
begins
my
sadness
my
brother
jaques
he
keeps
at
school
and
report
speaks
goldenly
of
his
profit
for
my
part
he
keeps
me
rustically
at
home
or
to
speak
more
properly
stays
me
here
at
home
unkept
for
call
you
that
keeping
for
a
gentleman
of
my
birth
that
differs
not
from
the
stalling
of
an
ox
his
horses
are
bred
better
for
besides
that
they
are
fair
with
their
feeding
they
are
taught
their
manage
and
to
that
end
riders
dearly
hired
but
i
his
brother
gain
nothing
under
him
but
growth
for
the
which
his
animals
on
his
dunghills
are
as
much
bound
to
him
as
i
besides
this
nothing
that
he
so
plentifully
gives
me
the
something
that
nature
gave
me
his
countenance
seems
to
take
from
me
he
lets
me
feed
with
his
hinds
bars
me
the
place
of
a
brother
and
as
much
as
in
him
lies
mines
my
gentility
with
my
education
this
is
it
adam
that
grieves
me
and
the
spirit
of
my
father
which
i
think
is
within
me
begins
to
mutiny
against
this
servitude
i
will
no
longer
endure
it
though
yet
i
know
no
wise
remedy
how
to
avoid
it
yonder
comes

master

the
courtesy
of

you
my
better
in

much
of
my

spirit
of
my
father

strong
in
me
and
i
will
no

exercises

three
or
four
loving
lords

died
to
stay
behind
her
she
is
at
the
court
and
no
less
beloved
of
her
uncle
than
his
own
daughter
and
never
two
ladies
loved
as
they
do
where
will
the
old
duke
live
they
say
he
is
already
in
the
forest
of
arden
and
a
many
merry
men
with
him
and
there
they
live
like
the
old
robin
hood
of
england
they
say
many
young
gentlemen
flock
to
him
every
day
and
fleet
the
time
carelessly
as
they
did
in
the
golden
world
what
you
wrestle
tomorrow
before
the
new
duke
marry
do
i
sir
and
i
came
to
acquaint
you
with
a
matter
i
am
given
sir
secretly
to
understand
that
your
younger
brother
orlando
hath
a
disposition
to
come
in
disguised
against
me
to
try
a
fall
tomorrow
sir
i
wrestle
for
my
credit
and
he
that
escapes
me
without
some
broken
limb
shall
acquit
him
well
your
brother
is
but
young
and
tender
and
for
your
love
i
would
be
loath
to
foil
him
as
i
must
for
my
own
honour
if
he
come
in
therefore
out
of
my
love
to
you
i
came
hither
to
acquaint
you
withal
that
either
you
might
stay
him
from
his
intendment
or
brook
such
disgrace
well
as
he
shall
run
into
in
that
it
is
a
thing
of
his
own
search
and
altogether
against
my
will
charles
i
thank
thee
for
thy
love
to
me
which
thou
shalt
find
i
will
most
kindly
requite
i
had
myself
notice
of
my
brothers
purpose
herein
and
have
by
underhand
means
laboured
to
dissuade
him
from
it
but
he
is
resolute
ill
tell
thee
charles
it
is
the
stubbornest
young
fellow
of
france
full
of
ambition
an
envious
emulator
of
every
mans
good
parts
a
secret
and
villanous
contriver
against
me
his
natural
brother
therefore
use
thy
discretion
i
had
as
lief
thou
didst
break
his
neck
as
his
finger
and
thou
wert
best
look
tot
for
if
thou
dost
him
any
slight
disgrace
or
if
he
do
not
mightily
grace
himself
on
thee
he
will
practise
against
thee
by
poison
entrap
thee
by
some
treacherous
device
and
never
leave
thee
till
he
hath
taen
thy
life
by
some
indirect
means
or
other
for
i
assure
thee
and
almost
with
tears
i
speak
it
there
is
not
one
so
young
and
so
villanous
this
day
living
i
speak
but
brotherly
of
him
but
should
i
anatomize
him
to
thee
as
he
is
i
must
blush
and
weep
and
thou
must
look
pale
and
wonder
i
am
heartily
glad
i
came
hither
to
you
if
he
come
tomorrow
ill
give
him
his
payment
if
ever
he

alone
again
ill
never
wrestle
for
prize
more
and
so
god
keep
your
worship
farewell
good
charles
now
will
i
stir
this
gamester
i
hope
i
shall
see
an
end
of
him
for
my
soul
yet
i
know
not
why
hates
nothing
more
than
he
yet
hes
gentle
never
schooled
and
yet
learned
full
of
noble
device
of
all
sorts
enchantingly
beloved
and
indeed
so
much
in
the
heart
of
the
world
and
especially
of
my
own
people
who
best
know
him
that
i
am
altogether
misprised
but
it
shall
not
be
so
long
this
wrestler
shall
clear
all
nothing
remains
but
that
i
kindle
the
boy
thither
which
now
ill
go
about
i
pray
thee
rosalind
sweet
my
coz
be
merry
dear
celia
i
show
more
mirth
than
i
am
mistress
of
and
would
you
yet
i
were
merrier
unless
you
could
teach
me
to
forget
a
banished
father
you
must
not
learn
me
how
to
remember
any
extraordinary
pleasure
herein
i
see
thou
lovest
me
not
with
the
full
weight
that
i
love
thee
if
my
uncle
thy
banished
father
had
banished
thy
uncle
the
duke
my
father
so
thou
hadst
been
still
with
me
i
could
have
taught
my
love
to
take
thy
father
for
mine
so
wouldst
thou
if
the
truth
of
thy
love
to
me
were
so
righteously
tempered
as
mine
is
to
thee
well
i
will
forget
the
condition
of
my
estate
to
rejoice
in
yours
you
know
my
father
hath
no
child
but
i
nor
none
is
like
to
have
and
truly
when
he
dies
thou
shalt
be
his
heir
for
what
he
hath
taken
away
from
thy
father
perforce
i
will
render
thee
again
in
affection
by
mine
honour
i
will
and
when
i
break
that
oath
let
me
turn
monster
therefore
my
sweet
rose
my
dear
rose
be
merry
from
henceforth
i
will
coz
and
devise
sports
let
me
see
what
think
you
of
falling
in
love
marry
i
prithee
do
to
make
sport
withal
but
love
no
man
in
good
earnest
nor
no
further
in
sport
neither
than
with
safety
of
a
pure
blush
thou
mayst
in
honour
come
off
again
what
shall
be
our
sport
then
let
us
sit
and
mock
the
good
housewife
fortune
from
her
wheel
that
her
gifts
may
henceforth
be
bestowed
equally
i
would
we
could
do
so
for
her
benefits
are
mightily
misplaced
and
the
bountiful
blind
woman
doth
most
mistake
in
her
gifts
to
women
tis
true
for
those
that
she
makes
fair
she
scarce
makes
honest
and
those
that
she
makes
honest
she
makes
very
illfavouredly
nay
now
thou
goest
from
fortunes
office
to
natures
fortune
reigns
in
gifts
of
the
world
not
in
the
lineaments
of
nature
no
when
nature
hath
made
a
fair
creature
may
she
not
by
fortune
fall
into
the
fire
though
nature
hath
given
us
wit
to
flout
at
fortune
hath
not
fortune
sent
in
this
fool
to
cut
off
the
argument
indeed
there
is
fortune
too
hard
for
nature
when
fortune
makes
natures
natural
the
cutteroff
of
natures
wit
peradventure
this
is
not
fortunes
work
neither
but
natures
who
perceiving
our
natural
wits
too
dull
to
reason
of
such
goddesses
hath
sent
this
natural
for
our
whetstone
for
always
the
dulness
of
the
fool
is
the
whetstone
of
the
wits
how
now
wit
whither
wander
you
mistress
you
must
come
away
to
your
father
were
you
made
the
messenger
no
by
mine
honour
but
i
was
bid
to
come
for
you
where
learned
you
that
oath
fool
of
a
certain
knight
that
swore
by
his
honour
they
were
good
pancakes
and
swore
by
his
honour
the
mustard
was
naught
now
ill
stand
to
it
the
pancakes
were
naught
and
the
mustard
was
good
and
yet
was
not
the
knight
forsworn
how
prove
you
that
in
the
great
heap
of
your
knowledge
ay
marry
now
unmuzzle
your
wisdom
stand
you
both
forth
now
stroke
your
chins
and
swear
by
your
beards
that
i
am
a
knave
by
our
beards
if
we
had
them
thou
art
by
my
knavery
if
i
had
it
then
i
were
but
if
you
swear
by
that
that
is
not
you
are
not
forsworn
no
more
was
this
knight
swearing
by
his
honour
for
he
never
had
any
or
if
he
had
he
had
sworn
it
away
before
ever
he
saw
those
pancakes
or
that
mustard
prithee
who
ist
that
thou
meanest
one
that
old
frederick
your
father
loves
my
fathers
love
is
enough
to
honour
him
enough
speak
no
more
of
him
youll
be
whipped
for
taxation
one
of
these
days
the
more
pity
that
fools
may
not
speak
wisely
what
wise
men
do
foolishly
by
my
troth
thou
sayest
true
for
since
the
little
wit
that
fools
have
was
silenced
the
little
foolery
that
wise
men
have
makes
a
great
show
here
comes
monsieur
le
beau
with
his
mouth
full
of
news
which
he
will
put
on
us
as
pigeons
feed
their
young
then
we
shall
be
newscrammd
all
the
better
we
shall
be
more
marketable
bon
jour
monsieur
le
beau
whats
the
news
fair
princess

lost
much
good
sport
sport
of
what
colour
what
colour
madam
how
shall
i
answer
you
as
wit
and
fortune
will
or
as
the
destinies
decree
well
said

with
a
trowel

my
rank

losest
thy
old
smell

me
ladies

the
sight
of

tell
us
the
manner
of
the
wrestling

will
tell
you
the
beginning
and

may
see
the
end
for
the
best
is
yet
to
do
and
here
where
you
are
they
are
coming
to
perform
it
well
the
beginning
that
is
dead
and
buried
there
comes
an
old
man
and
his
three
sons
i
could
match
this
beginning
with
an
old
tale
three
proper
young
men
of
excellent
growth
and
presence
with
bills
on
their
necks
be
it
known
unto
all
men
by
these
presents
the
eldest
of
the
three
wrestled
with
charles
the
dukes
wrestler
which
charles
in
a
moment
threw
him
and
broke
three
of
his
ribs
that
there
is
little
hope
of
life
in
him
so
he
served
the
second
and
so
the
third
yonder
they
lie
the
poor
old
man
their
father
making
such
pitiful
dole
over
them
that
all
the
beholders
take
his
part
with
weeping
alas
but
what
is
the
sport
monsieur
that
the
ladies
have
lost
why
this
that
i
speak
of
thus
men
may
grow
wiser
every
day
it
is
the
first
time
that
ever
i
heard
breaking
of
ribs
was
sport
for
ladies
or
i
i
promise
thee
but
is
there
any
else
longs
to
feel
this
broken
music
in
his
sides

another
dotes
upon
ribbreaking

youth
will
not
be
entreated

own
peril
on
his
forwardness
is
yonder

he
madam
alas

is
too
young

looks
successfully

crept
hither
to
see
the
wrestling

delight
in
it
i
can
tell

there
is
such
odds
in
the
man
in
pity
of
the
challengers
youth
i
would
fam
dissuade
him
but
he
will
not
be
entreated

to
him

challenged
charles
the
wrestler

the
general
challenger

in
as
others
do
to
try
with
him
the
strength
of
my
youth
young
gentleman
your
spirits
are
too
bold
for
your
years
you
have
seen
cruel
proof
of
this
mans
strength
if
you
saw
yourself
with
your
eyes
or
knew
yourself
with
your
judgment
the
fear
of
your
adventure
would
counsel
you
to
a
more
equal
enterprise
we
pray
you
for
your
own
sake
to
embrace
your
own
safety
and
give
over
this
attempt
do
young
sir
your
reputation
shall
not
therefore
be
misprised
we
will
make
it
our
suit
to
the
duke
that
the
wrestling
might
not
go
forward
i
beseech
you
punish
me
not
with
your
hard
thoughts
wherein
i
confess
me
much
guilty
to
deny
so
fair
and
excellent
ladies
anything
but
let
your
fair
eyes
and
gentle
wishes
go
with
me
to
my
trial
wherein
if
i
be
foiled
there
is
but
one
shamed
that
was
never
gracious
if
killed
but
one
dead
that
is
willing
to
be
so
i
shall
do
my
friends
no
wrong
for
i
have
none
to
lament
me
the
world
no
injury
for
in
it
i
have
nothing
only
in
the
world
i
fill
up
a
place
which
may
be
better
supplied
when
i
have
made
it
empty
the
little
strength
that
i
have
i
would
it
were
with
you
and
mine
to
eke
out
hers
fare

be
deceived
in
you
your
hearts

so
desirous
to
lie
with
his
mother

will

in
it
a
more
modest
working
you
shall
try
but

warrant
your
grace
you
shall
not
entreat
him
to
a
second
that

so
mightily
persuaded
him
from
a
first

mean
to
mock
me
after
you
should

mocked
me
before

that
calling
to

adopted
heir
to
frederick
my

lovd
sir
rowland
as
his
soul
and
all
the
world
was
of
my
fathers
mind
had
i
before
known
this
young
man
his
son
i

have
given

tears
unto
entreaties

thus
have
venturd
gentle
cousin
let

and
encourage

my

rough
and
envious
disposition
sticks
me
at
heart
sir
you

well
deservd
if

do
keep
your
promises
in
love
but
justly
as

your
mistress

be
happy
gentleman
wear
this
for

out
of

but
a
quintain
a
mere
lifeless
block

calls
us
back
my
pride
fell
with
my
fortunes
ill
ask
him
what
he
would
did
you

overthrown
more
than
your
enemies

do
in
friendship
counsel
you
to
leave
this
place
albeit
you
have
deservd
high
commendation
true
applause
and
love
yet
such
is
now
the
dukes
condition
that
he
misconstrues
all
that
you
have
done
the
duke
is
humorous
what
he
is
indeed
more
suits
you
to
conceive
than
i
to
speak
of
i
thank
you
sir
and
pray
you
tell
me
this
which
of
the
two
was
daughter
of
the
duke
that
here
was
at
the
wrestling
neither
his
daughter
if
we
judge
by
manners
but
yet
indeed
the
smaller
is
his
daughter
the
other
is
daughter
to
the
banishd
duke
and
here
detaind
by
her
usurping
uncle
to
keep
his
daughter
company
whose
loves
are
dearer
than
the
natural
bond
of
sisters
but
i
can
tell
you
that
of
late
this
duke
hath
taen
displeasure
gainst
his
gentle
niece
grounded
upon
no
other
argument
but
that
the
people
praise
her
for
her
virtues
and
pity
her
for
her
good
fathers
sake
and
on
my
life
his
malice
gainst
the
lady
will
suddenly
break
forth
sir
fare
you
well
hereafter
in
a
better
world
than
this
i
shall
desire
more
love
and
knowledge
of
you
i
rest
much
bounden
to
you
fare
you
well
thus
must
i
from
the
smoke
into
the
smother
from
tyrant
duke
unto
a
tyrant
brother
but
heavenly
rosalind
why
cousin
why
rosalind
cupid
have
mercy
not
a
word
not
one
to
throw
at
a
dog
no
thy
words
are
too
precious
to
be
cast
away
upon
curs
throw
some
of
them
at
me
come
lame
me
with
reasons
then
there
were
two
cousins
laid
up
when
the
one
should
be
lamed
with
reasons
and
the
other
mad
without
any
but
is
all
this
for
your
father
no
some
of
it
is
for
my
childs
father
o
how
full
of
briers
is
this
workingday
world
they
are
but
burrs
cousin
thrown
upon
thee
in
holiday
foolery
if
we
walk
not
in
the
trodden
paths
our
very
petticoats
will
catch
them
i
could
shake
them
off
my
coat
these
burrs
are
in
my
heart
hem
them
away
i
would
try
if
i
could
cry
hem
and
have
him
come
come
wrestle
with
thy
affections
o
they
take
the
part
of
a
better
wrestler
than
myself
o
a
good
wish
upon
you
you
will
try
in
time
in
despite
of
a
fall
but
turning
these
jests
out
of
service
let
us
talk
in
good
earnest
is
it
possible
on
such
a
sudden
you
should
fall
into
so
strong
a
liking
with
old
sir
rowlands
youngest
son
the
duke
my
father
loved
his
father
dearly
doth
it
therefore
ensue
that
you
should
love
his
son
dearly
by
this
kind
of
chase
i
should
hate
him
for
my
father
hated
his
father
dearly
yet
i
hate
not
orlando
no
faith
hate
him
not
for
my
sake
why
should
i
not
doth
he
not
deserve
well
let
me
love
him
for
that
and
do
you
love
him
because
i
do
look
here
comes
the
duke
with
his
eyes
full
of
anger
mistress
dispatch
you
with
your
safest
haste
and
get
you
from
our
court
me
uncle
you
cousin
within
these
ten
days
if
that
thou
best
found
so
near
our
public
court
as
twenty
miles
thou
diest
for
it
i
do
beseech
your
grace
let
me
the
knowledge
of
my
fault
bear
with
me
if
with
myself
i
hold
intelligence
or
have
acquaintance
with
mine
own
desires
if
that
i
do
not
dream
or
be
not
frantic
as
i
do
trust
i
am
not
then
dear
uncle
never
so
much
as
in
a
thought
unborn
did
i
offend
your
highness
thus
do
all
traitors
if
their
purgation
did
consist
in
words
they
are
as
innocent
as
grace
itself
let
it
suffice
thee
that
i
trust
thee
not
yet
your
mistrust
cannot
make
me
a
traitor
tell
me
whereon
the
likelihood
depends
thou
art
thy
fathers
daughter
theres
enough
so
was
i
when
your
highness
took
his
dukedom
so
was
i
when
your
highness
banishd
him
treason
is
not
inherited
my
lord
or
if
we
did
derive
it
from
our
friends
whats
that
to
me
my
father
was
no
traitor
then
good
my
liege
mistake
me
not
so
much
to
think
my
poverty
is
treacherous
dear
sovereign
hear
me
speak
ay
celia
we
stayd
her
for
your
sake
else
had
she
with
her
father
rangd
along
i
did
not
then
entreat
to
have
her
stay

your
pleasure
and
your

time
to

i
know
her
if
she
be
a
traitor
why
so
am
i
we
still
have
slept
together
rose
at
an
instant
learnd
playd
eat
together
and
wheresoeer
we
went
like
junos
swans
still
we
went
coupled
and
inseparable
she
is
too
subtle
for
thee
and
her
smoothness
her
very
silence
and
her
patience
speak
to
the
people
and
they
pity
her
thou
art
a
fool
she
robs
thee
of
thy
name
and
thou
wilt
show
more
bright
and
seem
more
virtuous
when
she
is
gone
then
open
not
thy
lips
firm
and
irrevocable
is
my
doom
which
i
have
passd
upon
her
she

that
sentence
then
on
me
my
liege
i
cannot
live
out
of
her
company

are
a
fool

yourself
if
you

time
upon
mine
honour

my
poor
rosalind
whither

part
sweet
girl
no
let
my
father
seek
another
heir
therefore
devise
with
me
how
we
may
fly
whither
to
go
and
what
to
bear
with
us
and
do
not
seek
to
take
your
change
upon
you
to
bear
your
griefs
yourself
and
leave
me
out
for
by
this
heaven
now
at
our
sorrows
pale
say
what
thou
canst
ill
go
along
with
thee
why
whither
shall
we
go
to
seek
my
uncle
in
the
forest
of
arden
alas
what
danger
will
it
be
to
us
maids
as
we
are
to
travel
forth
so
far
beauty
provoketh
thieves
sooner
than
gold
ill
put
myself
in
poor
and
mean
attire
and
with
a
kind
of
umber
smirch
my
face
the
like
do
you
so
shall
we
pass
along
and
never
stir
assailants
were
it
not
better
because
that
i
am
more
than
common
tall
that
i
did
suit
me
all
points
like
a
man
a
gallant
curtleaxe
upon
my
thigh
a
boarspear
in
my
hand
and
in
my
heart
lie
there
what
hidden
womans
fear
there
will
well
have
a
swashing
and
a
martial
outside
as
many
other
mannish
cowards
have
that
do
outface
it
with
their
semblances
what
shall
i
call
thee
when
thou
art
a
man
ill
have
no
worse
a
name
than
joves
own
page
and
therefore
look
you
call
me
ganymede
but
what
will
you
be
calld
something
that
hath
a
reference
to
my
state
no
longer
celia
but
aliena
but
cousin
what
if
we
assayd
to
steal
the
clownish
fool
out
of
your
fathers
court
would
he
not
be
a
comfort
to
our
travel
hell
go
along
oer
the
wide
world
with
me
leave
me
alone
to
woo
him
lets
away
and
get
our
jewels
and
our
wealth
together
devise
the
fittest
time
and
safest
way
to
hide
us
from
pursuit
that
will
be
made
after
my
flight
now
go
we
in
content
to
liberty
and
not
to
banishment
now
my
comates
and
brothers
in
exile
hath
not
old
custom
made
this
life
more
sweet
than
that
of
painted
pomp
are
not
these
woods
more
free
from
peril
than
the
envious
court
here
feel
we
but
the
penalty
of
adam
the
seasons
difference
as
the
icy
fang
and
churlish
chiding
of
the
winters
wind
which
when
it
bites
and
blows
upon
my
body
even
till
i
shrink
with
cold
i
smile
and
say
this
is
no
flattery
these
are
counsellors
that
feelingly
persuade
me
what
i
am
sweet
are
the
uses
of
adversity
which
like
the
toad
ugly
and
venomous
wears
yet
a
precious
jewel
in
his
head
and
this
our
life
exempt
from
public
haunt
finds
tongues
in
trees
books
in
the
running
brooks
sermons
in
stones
and
good
in
every
thing
i
would
not
change
it
happy
is
your
grace
that
can
translate
the
stubbornness
of
fortune
into
so
quiet
and
so
sweet
a
style
come
shall
we
go
and
kill
us
venison
and
yet
it
irks
me
the
poor
dappled
fools
being
native
burghers
of
this
desert
city
should
in
their
own
confines
with
forked
heads
have
their
round
haunches
gord
indeed
my
lord
the
melancholy
jaques
grieves
at
that
and
in
that
kind
swears
you
do
more
usurp
than
doth
your
brother
that
hath
banishd
you
today
my
lord
of
amiens
and
myself
did
steal
behind
him
as
he
lay
along
under
an
oak
whose
antique
root
peeps
out
upon
the
brook
that
brawls
along
this
wood
to
the
which
place
a
poor
sequesterd
stag
that
from
the
hunters
aim
had
taen
a
hurt
did
come
to
languish
and
indeed
my
lord
the
wretched
animal
heavd
forth
such
groans
that
their
discharge
did
stretch
his
leathern
coat
almost
to
bursting
and
the
big
round
tears
coursd
one
another
down
his
innocent
nose
in
piteous
chase
and
thus
the
hairy
fool
much
marked
of
the
melancholy
jaques
stood
on
the
extremest
verge
of
the
swift
brook
augmenting
it
with
tears
but
what
said
jaques
did
he
not
moralize
this
spectacle
o
yes
into
a
thousand
similes
first
for
his
weeping
into
the
needless
stream
poor
deer
quoth
he
thou
makst
a
testament
as
worldlings
do
giving
thy
sum
of
more
to
that
which
had
too
much
then
being
there
alone
left
and
abandond
of
his
velvet
friends
tis
right
quoth
he
thus
misery
doth
part
the
flux
of
company
anon
a
careless
herd
full
of
the
pasture
jumps
along
by
him
and
never
stays
to
greet
him
ay
quoth
jaques
sweep
on
you
fat
and
greasy
citizens
tis
just
the
fashion
wherefore
do
you
look
upon
that
poor
and
broken
bankrupt
there
thus
most
invectively
he
pierceth
through
the
body
of
the
country
city
court
yea
and
of
this
our
life
swearing
that
we
are
mere
usurpers
tyrants
and
whats
worse
to
fright
the
animals
and
to
kill
them
up
in
their
assignd
and
native
dwellingplace
and
did
you
leave
him
in
this
contemplation
we
did
my
lord
weeping
and
commenting
upon
the
sobbing
deer
show
me
the
place
i
love
to
cope
him
in
these
sullen
fits
for
then
hes
full
of
matter
ill
bring
you
to
him
straight
can
it
be
possible
that
no
man
saw
them

cannot
be

villains

my
court

of
consent
and
sufferance

this
i
cannot

chamber

and
boisterous
sword

a
thievish
living
on
the
common
road

i
must
do
or

what
to

this
i
will
not

to
the
malice
of
a
diverted
blood
and
bloody
brother
but
do
not
so
i
have
five
hundred
crowns
the
thrifty
hire
i
savd
under
your
father
which
i
did
store
to
be
my
fosternurse
when
service
should
in
my
old
limbs
lie
lame
and
unregarded
age
in
corners
thrown
take
that
and
he
that
doth
the
ravens
feed

providently
caters
for
the
sparrow

my
age

the
gold
all
this
i
give
you
let
me
be
your
servant
though
i
look
old
yet
i
am
strong
and
lusty
for
in
my
youth
i
never
did
apply
hot
and
rebellious
liquors
in
my
blood
nor
did
not
with
unbashful
forehead
woo
the
means
of
weakness
and
debility
therefore
my
age
is
as
a
lusty
winter
frosty
but
kindly
let
me
go
with
you
ill
do
the
service
of
a
younger
man
in
all
your
business
and
necessities
o
good
old
man
how
well
in
thee
appears
the
constant
service
of
the
antique
world
when
service
sweat
for
duty
not
for
meed
thou
art
not
for
the
fashion
of
these
times
where
none
will
sweat
but
for
promotion
and
having
that
do
choke
their
service
up
even
with
the
having
it
is
not
so
with
thee
but
poor
old
man
thou
prunst
a
rotten
tree
that
cannot
so
much
as
a
blossom
yield
in
lieu
of
all
thy
pains
and
husbandry
but
come
thy
ways
well
go
along
together
and
ere
we
have
thy
youthful
wages
spent
well
light
upon
some
settled
low
content
master
go
on
and
i
will
follow
thee
to
the
last
gasp
with
truth
and
loyalty
from
seventeen
years
till
now
almost
fourscore
here
lived
i
but
now
live
here
no
more
at
seventeen
years
many
their
fortunes
seek
but
at
fourscore
it
is
too
late
a
week
yet
fortune
cannot
recompense
me
better
than
to
die
well
and
not
my
masters
debtor
o
jupiter
how
weary
are
my
spirits
i
care
not
for
my
spirits
if
my
legs
were
not
weary
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
disgrace
my
mans
apparel
and
to
cry
like
a
woman
but
i
must
comfort
the
weaker
vessel
as
doublet
and
hose
ought
to
show
itself
courageous
to
petticoat
therefore
courage
good
aliena
i
pray
you
bear
with
me
i
cannot
go
no
further
for
my
part
i
had
rather
bear
with
you
than
bear
you
yet
i
should
bear
no
cross
if
i
did
bear
you
for
i
think
you
have
no
money
in
your
purse
well
this
is
the
forest
of
arden
ay
now
am
i
in
arden
the
more
fool
i
when
i
was
at
home
i
was
in
a
better
place
but
travellers
must
be
content
ay
be
so
good
touchstone
look
you
who
comes
here
a
young
man
and
an
old
in
solemn
talk
that
is
the
way
to
make
her
scorn
you
still
o
corin
that
thou
knewst
how
i
do
love
her
i
partly
guess
for
i
have
lovd
ere
now
no
corin
being
old
thou
canst
not
guess
though
in
thy
youth
thou
wast
as
true
a
lover
as
ever
sighd
upon
a
midnight
pillow
but
if
thy
love
were
ever
like
to
mine
as
sure
i
think
did
never
man
love
so
how
many
actions
most
ridiculous
hast
thou
been
drawn
to
by
thy
fantasy
into
a
thousand
that
i
have
forgotten
o
thou
didst
then
neer
love
so
heartily
if
thou
rememberst
not
the
slightest
folly
that
ever
love
did
make
thee
run
into
thou
hast
not
lovd
or
if
thou
hast
not
sat
as
i
do
now
wearing
thy
hearer
with
thy
mistress
praise
thou
hast
not
lovd
or
if
thou
hast
not
broke
from
company
abruptly
as
my
passion
now
makes
me
thou
hast
not
lovd
o
phebe
phebe
phebe
alas
poor
shepherd
searching
of
thy
wound
i
have
by
hard
adventure
found
mine
own
and
i
mine
i
remember
when
i
was
in
love
i
broke
my
sword
upon
a
stone
and
bid
him
take
that
for
coming
anight
to
jane
smile
and
i
remember
the
kissing
of
her
batler
and
the
cows
dugs
that
her
pretty
chopped
hands
had
milked
and
i
remember
the
wooing
of
a
peascod
instead
of
her
from
whom
i
took
two
cods
and
giving
her
them
again
said
with
weeping
tears
wear
these
for
my
sake
we
that
are
true
lovers
run
into
strange
capers
but
as
all
is
mortal
in
nature
so
is
all
nature
in
love
mortal
in
folly
thou
speakest
wiser
than
thou
art
ware
of
nay
i
shall
neer
be
ware
of
mine
own
wit
till
i
break
my
shins
against
it
jove
jove
this
shepherds
passion
is
much
upon
my
fashion
and
mine
but
it
grows
something
stale
with
me
i
pray
you
one
of
you
question
yond
man
if
he
for
gold
will
give
us
any
food

young
maid

much
oppressd
and
faints
for
succour
fair
sir

her
but
i
am
shepherd
to
another
man
and

churlish
disposition

recks
to
find
the
way
to
heaven
by
doing
deeds
of
hospitality
besides
his
cote
his
flocks
and
bounds
of

and
the
flock
and
thou
shalt
have
to
pay
for

thy
wages

time

merry
note

then
if

thank

man
ill
thank
you
but
that

call
compliment
is
like
the
encounter
of
two
dogapes
and

man

i
have
given
him
a
penny
and
he

many
matters
as

but
i
give

verse
to

if

a

ill
rail
against

the
duke

prepared
dear
master

can
go
no
further
o
i
die
for
food

down
and
measure
out
my
grave
farewell
kind
master
why
how
now
adam
no
greater
heart
in
thee
live
a
little
comfort
a
little
cheer

a
little
if
this
uncouth
forest
yield
anything
savage
i
will
either
be
food
for
it
or
bring
it
for
food
to
thee
thy
conceit
is
nearer
death
than
thy
powers
for
my
sake
be
comfortable
hold
death
awhile
at
the
arms
end
i
will
here
be
with
thee
presently
and
if
i
bring
thee
not
something

come
thou
art
a
mocker
of
my
labour
well
said
thou
lookest
cheerly
and
ill
be
with
thee
quickly
yet
thou
liest
in
the
bleak
air
come
i
will
bear
thee
to
some
shelter
and
thou
shalt
not
die
for
lack
of
a
dinner
if
there
live
anything
in
this
desert
cheerly
good
adam
i
think
he
be
transformd
into
a
beast
for
i
can
nowhere
find
him
like
a
man
my
lord
he
is
but
even
now
gone
hence
here
was
he
merry
hearing
of
a
song
if
he
compact
of
jars
grow
musical
we
shall
have
shortly
discord
in
the
spheres
go
seek
him
tell
him
i
would
speak
with
him
he
saves
my
labour
by
his
own
approach
why
how
now
monsieur
what
a
life
is
this
that
your
poor
friends
must
woo
your
company
what
you
look
merrily
a
fool
a
fool
i
met
a
fool
i
the
forest
a
motley
fool
a
miserable
world
as
i
do
live
by
food
i
met
a
fool
who
laid
him
down
and
baskd
him
in
the
sun
and
raild
on
lady
fortune
in
good
terms
in
good
set
terms
and
yet
a
motley
fool
good
morrow
fool
quoth
i
no
sir
quoth
he
call
me
not
fool
till
heaven
hath
sent
me
fortune
and
then
he
drew
a
dial
from
his
poke
and
looking
on
it
with
lacklustre
eye
says
very
wisely
it
is
ten
oclock
thus
may
we
see
quoth
he
how
the
world
wags
tis
but
an
hour
ago
since
it
was
nine
and
after
one
hour
more
twill
be
eleven
and
so
from
hour
to
hour
we
ripe
and
ripe
and
then
from
hour
to
hour
we
rot
and
rot
and
thereby
hangs
a
tale
when
i
did
hear
the
motley
fool
thus
moral
on
the
time
my
lungs
began
to
crow
like
chanticleer
that
fools
should
be
so
deepcontemplative
and
i
did
laugh
sans
intermission
an
hour
by
his
dial
o
noble
fool
a
worthy
fool
motleys
the
only
wear
what
fool
is
this
o
worthy
fool
one
that
hath
been
a
courtier
and
says
if
ladies
be
but
young
and
fair
they
have
the
gift
to
know
it
and
in
his
brain
which
is
as
dry
as
the
remainder
biscuit
after
a
voyage
he
hath
strange
places
crammd
with
observation
the
which
he
vents
in
mangled
forms
o
that
i
were
a
fool
i
am
ambitious
for
a
motley
coat
thou
shalt
have
one
it
is
my
only
suit
provided
that
you
weed
your
better
judgments
of
all
opinion
that
grows
rank
in
them
that
i
am
wise
i
must
have
liberty
withal
as
large
a
charter
as
the
wind
to
blow
on
whom
i
please
for
so
fools
have
and
they
that
are
most
galled
with
my
folly
they
most
must
laugh
and
why
sir
must
they
so
the
why
is
plain
as
way
to
parish
church
he
that
a
fool
doth
very
wisely
hit
doth
very
foolishly
although
he
smart
not
to
seem
senseless
of
the
bob
if
not
the
wise
mans
folly
is
anatomizd
even
by
the
squandering
glances
of
the
fool
invest
me
in
my
motley
give
me
leave
to
speak
my
mind
and
i
will
through
and
through
cleanse
the
foul
body
of
th
infected
world
if
they
will
patiently
receive
my
medicine
fie
on
thee
i
can
tell
what
thou
wouldst
do
what
for
a
counter
would
i
do
but
good
most
mischievous
foul
sin
in
chiding
sin
for
thou
thyself
hast
been
a
libertine
as
sensual
as
the
brutish
sting
itself
and
all
the
embossed
sores
and
headed
evils
that
thou
with
licence
of
free
foot
hast
caught
wouldst
thou
disgorge
into
the
general
world
why
who
cries
out
on
pride
that
can
therein
tax
any
private
party
doth
it
not
flow
as
hugely
as
the
sea
till
that
the
weary
very
means
do
ebb
what
woman
in
the
city
do
i
name
when
that
i
say
the
citywoman
bears
the
cost
of
princes
on
unworthy
shoulders
who
can
come
in
and
say
that
i
mean
her
when
such
a
one
as
she
such
is
her
neighbour
or
what
is
he
of
basest
function
that
says
his
bravery
is
not
on
my
cost
thinking
that
i
mean
him
but
therein
suits
his
folly
to
the
mettle
of
my
speech
there
then
how
then
what
then
let
me
see
wherein
my
tongue
hath
wrongd
him
if
it
do
him
right
then
he
hath
wrongd
himself
if
he
be
free
why
then
my
taxing
like
a
wild
goose
flies
unclaimd
of
any
man
but
who
comes
here
forbear
and
eat
no
more
why
i
have
eat
none
yet
nor
shalt
not
till
necessity
be
servd
of
what
kind
should
this
cock
come
of
art
thou
thus
boldend
man
by
thy
distress
or
else
a
rude
despiser
of
good
manners
that
in
civility
thou
seemst
so
empty
you
touchd
my
vein
at
first
the
thorny
point
of
bare
distress
hath
taen
from
me
the
show
of
smooth
civility
yet
i
am
inland
bred
and
know
some
nurture
but
forbear
i
say
he
dies
that
touches
any
of
this
fruit
till
i
and
my
affairs
are
answered
an
you
will
not
be
answered
with
reason
i
must
die
what
would
you
have
your
gentleness
shall
force
more
than
your
force
move
us
to
gentleness
i
almost
die
for
food
and
let
me
have
it
sit
down
and
feed
and
welcome
to
our
table
speak
you
so
gently
pardon
me
i
pray
you
i
thought
that
all
things
had
been
savage
here
and
therefore
put
i
on
the
countenance
of
stern
commandment
but
whateer
you
are
that
in
this
desert
inaccessible
under
the
shade
of
melancholy
boughs
lose
and
neglect
the
creeping
hours
of
time
if
ever
you
have
lookd
on
better
days
if
ever
been
where
bells
have
knolld
to
church
if
ever
sat
at
any
good
mans
feast
if
ever
from
your
eyelids
wipd
a
tear
and
know
what
tis
to
pity
and
be
pitied
let
gentleness
my
strong
enforcement
be
in
the
which
hope
i
blush
and
hide
my
sword
true
is
it
that
we
have
seen
better
days
and
have
with
holy
bell
been
knolld
to
church
and
sat
at
good
mens
feasts
and
wipd
our
eyes
of
drops
that
sacred
pity
hath
engenderd
and
therefore
sit
you
down
in
gentleness
and
take
upon
command
what
help
we
have
that
to
your
wanting
may
be
ministerd
then
but
forbear
your
food
a
little
while
whiles
like
a
doe
i
go
to
find
my
fawn
and
give
it
food
there
is
an
old
poor
man
who
after
me
hath
many
a
weary
step
limpd
in
pure
love
till
he
be
first
sufficd
oppressd
with
two
weak
evils
age
and
hunger
i
will
not
touch
a
bit
go
find
him
out
and
we
will
nothing
waste
till
you
return
i
thank
ye
and
be
blessd
for
your
good
comfort
thou
seest
we
are
not
all
alone
unhappy
this
wide
and
universal
theatre
presents
more
woful
pageants
than
the
scene
wherein
we
play
in
all
the
worlds
a
stage
and
all
the
men
and
women
merely
players
they
have
their
exits
and
their
entrances
and
one
man
in
his
time
plays
many
parts
his
acts
being
seven
ages
at
first
the
infant
mewling
and
puking
in
the
nurses
arms
and
then
the
whining
schoolboy
with
his
satchel
and
shining
morning
face
creeping
like
snail
unwillingly
to
school
and
then
the
lover
sighing
like
furnace
with
a
woful
ballad
made
to
his
mistress
eyebrow
then
a
soldier
full
of
strange
oaths
and
bearded
like
the
pard
jealous
in
honour
sudden
and
quick
in
quarrel
seeking
the
bubble
reputation
even
in
the
cannons
mouth
and
then
the
justice
in
fair
round
belly
with
good
capon
lind
with
eyes
severe
and
beard
of
formal
cut
full
of
wise
saws
and
modern
instances
and
so
he
plays
his
part
the
sixth
age
shifts
into
the
lean
and
slipperd
pantaloon
with
spectacles
on
nose
and
pouch
on
side
his
youthful
hose
well
savd
a
world
too
wide
for
his
shrunk
shank
and
his
big
manly
voice
turning
again
toward
childish
treble
pipes
and
whistles
in
his
sound
last
scene
of
all
that
ends
this
strange
eventful
history
is
second
childishness
and
mere
oblivion
sans
teeth
sans
eyes
sans
taste
sans
everything
welcome
set
down
your
venerable
burden
and
let
him
feed

thank
you
most
for
him

such
a
nature
make
an
extent
upon
his
house
and
lands
do
this
expediently
and
turn
him

my
verse
in
witness
of
my
love
and
thou
thricecrowned
queen
of
night
survey
with
thy
chaste
eye
from
thy
pale
sphere
above
thy
huntress
name
that
my
full
life
doth
sway
o
rosalind
these
trees
shall
be
my
books
and
in
their
barks
my
thoughts
ill
character
that
every
eye
which
in
this
forest
looks
shall
see
thy
virtue
witnessd
everywhere
run
run
orlando
carve
on
every
tree
the
fair
the
chaste
and
unexpressive
she
and
how
like
you
this
shepherds
life
master
touchstone
truly
shepherd
in
respect
of
itself
it
is
a
good
life
but
in
respect
that
it
is
a
shepherds
life
it
is
naught
in
respect
that
it
is
solitary
i
like
it
very
well
but
in
respect
that
it
is
private
it
is
a
very
vile
life
now
in
respect
it
is
in
the
fields
it
pleaseth
me
well
but
in
respect
it
is
not
in
the
court
it
is
tedious
as
it
is
a
spare
life
look
you
it
fits
my
humour
well
but
as
there
is
no
more
plenty
in
it
it
goes
much
against
my
stomach
hast
any
philosophy
in
thee
shepherd
no
more
but
that
i
know
the
more
one
sickens
the
worse
at
ease
he
is
and
that
he
that
wants
money
means
and
content
is
without
three
good
friends
that
the
property
of
rain
is
to
wet
and
fire
to
burn
that
good
pasture
makes
fat
sheep
and
that
a
great
cause
of
the
night
is
lack
of
the
sun
that
he
that
hath
learned
no
wit
by
nature
nor
art
may
complain
of
good
breeding
or
comes
of
a
very
dull
kindred
such
a
one
is
a
natural
philosopher
wast
ever
in
court
shepherd
no
truly
then
thou
art
damned
nay
i
hope
truly
thou
art
damned
like
an
illroasted
egg
all
on
one
side
for
not
being
at
court
your
reason
why
if
thou
never
wast
at
court
thou
never
sawest
good
manners
if
thou
never
sawest
good
manners
then
thy
manners
must
be
wicked
and
wickedness
is
sin
and
sin
is
damnation
thou
art
in
a
parlous
state
shepherd
not
a
whit
touchstone
those
that
are
good
manners
at
the
court
are
as
ridiculous
in
the
country
as
the
behaviour
of
the
country
is
most
mockable
at
the
court
you
told
me
you
salute
not
at
the
court
but
you
kiss
your
hands
that
courtesy
would
be
uncleanly
if

make
an

retreat
though
not
with

with

didst
thou
hear
these
verses
o
yes
i
heard
them
all
and
more
too
for
some
of
them
had
in
them
more
feet
than
the
verses
would
bear
thats
no
matter
the
feet
might
bear
the
verses
ay
but
the
feet
were
lame
and
could
not
bear
themselves
without
the
verse
and
therefore
stood
lamely
in
the
verse
but
didst
thou
hear
without
wondering
how
thy
name
should
be
hanged
and
carved
upon
these
trees
i
was
seven
of
the
nine
days
out
of
the
wonder
before
you
came
for
look
here
what
i
found
on
a
palmtree
i
was
never
so
berimed
since
pythagoras
time
that
i
was
an
irish
rat
which
i
can
hardly
remember
trow
you
who
hath
done
this
is
it
a
man
and
a
chain
that
you
once
wore
about
his
neck
change
you
colour
i
prithee
who
o
lord
lord
it
is
a
hard
matter
for
friends
to
meet
but
mountains
may
be
removed
with
earthquakes
and
so
encounter
nay
but
who
is
it
is
it
possible
nay
i
prithee
now
with
most
petitionary
vehemence
tell
me
who
it
is
o
wonderful
wonderful
and
most
wonderful
wonderful
and
yet
again
wonderful
and
after
that
out
of
all
whooping
good
my
complexion
dost
thou
think
though
i
am
caparisond
like
a
man
i
have
a
doublet
and
hose
in
my
disposition
one
inch
of
delay
more
is
a
southsea
of
discovery
i
prithee
tell
me
who
is
it
quickly
and
speak
apace
i
would
thou
couldst
stammer
that
thou
mightst
pour
this
concealed
man
out
of
thy
mouth
as
wine
comes
out
of
a
narrowmouthd
bottle
either
too
much
at
once
or
none
at
all
i
prithee
take
the
cork
out
of
thy
mouth
that
i
may
drink
thy
tidings
so
you
may
put
a
man
in
your
belly
is
he
of
gods
making
what
manner
of
man
is
his
head
worth
a
hat
or
his
chin
worth
a
beard
nay
he
hath
but
a
little
beard
why
god
will
send
more
if
the
man
will
be
thankful
let
me
stay
the
growth
of
his
beard
if
thou
delay
me
not
the
knowledge
of
his
chin
it
is

tripped
up
the

nay
but
the

alas
the

what
shall
i
do
with
my
doublet
and

what
did
he
when
thou
sawest
him
what
said
he
how
looked
he
wherein
went
he
what
makes
he
here
did
he
ask
for
me
where
remains
he
how
parted
he
with
thee
and
when
shalt
thou
see
him
again
answer
me
in
one
word
you
must
borrow
me
gargantuas
mouth
first
tis
a
word
too
great
for
any
mouth
of
this
ages
size
to
say
ay
and
no
to
these
particulars
is
more
than
to
answer
in
a
catechism
but
doth
he
know
that
i
am
in
this
forest
and
in
mans
apparel
looks
he
as
freshly
as
he
did
the
day
he
wrestled
it
is
as
easy
to
count
atomies
as
to
resolve
the
propositions
of
a
lover
but
take
a
taste
of
my
finding
him
and
relish
it
with
good
observance
i
found
him
under
a
tree
like
a
dropped
acorn
it
may
well
be
called
joves
tree
when
it
drops
forth
such
fruit
give
me
audience
good
madam
proceed
there
lay
he
stretchd
along
like
a
wounded
knight
though
it
be
pity
to
see
such
a
sight
it
well
becomes
the
ground
cry
holla
to
thy
tongue
i
prithee
it
curvets
unseasonably
he
was
furnishd
like
a
hunter
o
ominous
he
comes
to
kill
my
heart
i
would
sing
my
song
without
a
burthen
thou
bringest
me
out
of
tune
do
you
not
know
i
am
a
woman
when
i
think
i
must
speak
sweet
say
on
you
bring
me
out
soft
comes
he
not
here

he
slink
by
and
note
him
i
thank
you
for
your
company
but
good
faith
i
had
as
lief

been
myself
alone
and
so
had
i
but
yet
for
fashion
sake
i
thank
you
too
for
your
society
god
be
wi
you
lets
meet
as
little
as
we
can
i
do
desire
we
may
be
better
strangers
i
pray
you
mar
no
more
trees
with
writing
lovesongs
in
their
barks
i
pray
you
mar
no
more
of
my
verses
with
reading
them
illfavouredly
rosalind
is
your
loves
name
yes
just
i
do
not
like
her
name
there
was
no
thought
of
pleasing
you
when
she
was
christened
what
stature
is
she
of
just
as
high
as
my
heart
you
are
full
of
pretty
answers
have
you
not
been
acquainted
with
goldsmiths
wives
and
connd
them
out
of
rings
not
so
but
i
answer
you
right
painted
cloth
from
whence
you
have
studied
your
questions
you
have
a
nimble
wit
i
think
twas
made
of
atalantas
heels
will
you
sit
down
with
me
and
we
two
will
rail
against
our
mistress
the
world
and
all
our
misery
i
will
chide
no
breather
in
the
world
but
myself
against
whom
i
know
most
faults
the
worst
fault
you
have
is
to
be
in
love
tis
a
fault
i
will
not
change
for
your
best
virtue
i
am
weary
of
you
by
my
troth
i
was
seeking
for
a
fool
when
i
found
you
he
is
drowned
in
the
brook
look
but
in
and
you
shall
see
him
there
i
shall
see
mine
own
figure
which
i
take
to
be
either
a
fool
or
a
cipher
ill
tarry
no
longer
with
you
farewell
good
signior
love
i
am
glad
of
your
departure
adieu
good
monsieur
melancholy
i
will
speak
to
him
like
a
saucy
lackey
and
under
that
habit
play
the
knave
with
him
do
you
hear
forester
very
well
what
would
you
i
pray
you
what
ist
oclock
you
should
ask
me
what
time
o
day
theres
no
clock
in
the
forest
then
there
is
no
true
lover
in
the
forest
else
sighing
every
minute
and
groaning
every
hour
would
detect
the
lazy
foot
of
time
as
well
as
a
clock
and
why
not
the
swift
foot
of
time
had
not
that
been
as
proper
by
no
means
sir
time
travels
in
divers
paces
with
divers
persons
ill
tell
you
who
time
ambles
withal
who
time
trots
withal
who
time
gallops
withal
and
who
he
stands
still
withal
i
prithee
who
doth
he
trot
withal
marry
he
trots
hard
with
a
young
maid
between
the
contract
of
her
marriage
and
the
day
it
is
solemnized
if
the
interim
be
but
a
sennight
times
pace
is
so
hard
that
it
seems
the
length
of
seven
year
who
ambles
time
withal
with
a
priest
that
lacks
latin
and
a
rich
man
that
hath
not
the
gout
for
the
one
sleeps
easily
because
he
cannot
study
and
the
other
lives
merrily
because
he
feels
no
pain
the
one
lacking
the
burden
of
lean
and
wasteful
learning
the
other
knowing
no
burden
of
heavy
tedious
penury
these
time
ambles
withal
who
doth
he
gallop
withal
with
a
thief
to
the
gallows
for
though
he
go
as
softly
as
foot
can
fall
he
thinks
himself
too
soon
there
who
stays
it
still
withal
with
lawyers
in
the
vacation
for
they
sleep
between
term
and
term
and
then
they
perceive
not
how
time
moves
where
dwell
you
pretty
youth
with
this
shepherdess
my
sister
here
in
the
skirts
of
the
forest
like
fringe
upon
a
petticoat
are
you
native
of
this
place
as
the
cony
that
you
see
dwell
where
she
is
kindled
your
accent
is
something
finer
than
you
could
purchase
in
so
removed
a
dwelling
i
have
been
told
so
of
many
but
indeed
an
old
religious
uncle
of
mine
taught
me
to
speak
who
was
in
his
youth
an
inland
man
one
that
knew
courtship
too
well
for
there
he
fell
in
love
i
have
heard
him
read
many
lectures
against
it
and
i
thank
god
i
am
not
a
woman
to
be
touched
with
so
many
giddy
offences
as
he
hath
generally
taxed
their
whole
sex
withal
can
you
remember
any
of
the
principal
evils
that
he
laid
to
the
charge
of
women
there
were
none
principal
they
were
all
like
one
another
as
halfpence
are
every
one
fault
seeming
monstrous
till
his
fellow
fault
came
to
match
it
i
prithee
recount
some
of
them
no
i
will
not
cast
away
my
physic
but
on
those
that
are
sick
there
is
a
man
haunts
the
forest
that
abuses
our
young
plants
with
carving
rosalind
on
their
barks
hangs
odes
upon
hawthorns
and
elegies
on
brambles
all
forsooth
deifying
the
name
of
rosalind
if
i
could
meet
that
fancymonger
i
would
give
him
some
good
counsel
for
he
seems
to
have
the
quotidian
of
love
upon
him
i
am
he
that
is
so
loveshaked
i
pray
you
tell
me
your
remedy
there
is
none
of
my
uncles
marks
upon
you
he
taught
me
how
to
know
a
man
in
love
in
which
cage
of
rushes
i
am
sure
you
are
not
prisoner
what
were
his
marks
a
lean
cheek
which
you
have
not
a
blue
eye
and
sunken
which
you
have
not
an
unquestionable
spirit
which
you
have
not
a
beard
neglected
which
you
have
not
but
i
pardon
you
for
that
for
simply
your
having
in
beard
is
a
younger
brothers
revenue
then
your
hose
should
be
ungartered
your
bonnet
unbanded
your
sleeve
unbuttoned
your
shoe
untied
and
everything
about
you
demonstrating
a
careless
desolation
but
you
are
no
such
man
you
are
rather
pointdevice
in
your
accoutrements
as
loving
yourself
than
seeming
the
lover
of
any
other
fair
youth
i
would
i
could
make
thee
believe
i
love
me
believe
it
you
may
as
soon
make
her
that
you
love
believe
it
which
i
warrant
she
is
apter
to
do
than
to
confess
she
does
that
is
one
of
the
points
in
the
which
women
still
give
the
lie
to
their
consciences
but
in
good
sooth
are
you
he
that
hangs
the
verses
on
the
trees
wherein
rosalind
is
so
admired
i
swear
to
thee
youth
by
the
white
hand
of
rosalind
i
am
that
he
that
unfortunate
he
but
are
you
so
much
in
love
as
your
rimes
speak
neither
rime
nor
reason
can
express
how
much
love
is
merely
a
madness
and
i
tell
you
deserves
as
well
a
dark
house
and
a
whip
as
madmen
do
and
the
reason
why
they
are
not
so
punished
and
cured
is
that
the
lunacy
is
so
ordinary
that
the
whippers
are
in
love
too
yet
i
profess
curing
it
by
counsel
did
you
ever
cure
any
so
yes
one
and
in
this
manner
he
was
to
imagine
me
his
love
his
mistress
and
i
set
him
every
day
to
woo
me
at
which
time
would
i
being
but
a
moonish
youth
grieve
be
effeminate
changeable
longing
and
liking
proud
fantastical
apish
shallow
inconstant
full
of
tears
full
of
smiles
for
every
passion
something
and
for
no
passion
truly
anything
as
boys
and
women
are
for
the
most
part
cattle
of
this
colour
would
now
like
him
now
loathe
him
then
entertain
him
then
forswear
him
now
weep
for
him
then
spit
at
him
that
i
drave
my
suitor
from
his
mad
humour
of
love
to
a
living
humour
of
madness
which
was
to
forswear
the
full
stream
of
the
world
and
to
live
in
a
nook
merely
monastic
and
thus
i

simple
feature

features
lord
warrant
us
what
features
i
am
here
with
thee
and
thy
goats
as
the
most
capricious
poet
honest
ovid
was
among
the
goths
o
knowledge
illinhabited
worse
than
jove
in
a
thatchd
house
when
a
mans
verses
cannot
be
understood
nor
a
mans
good
wit
seconded
with
the
forward
child
understanding
it
strikes
a
man
more
dead
than
a
great
reckoning
in
a
little
room
truly
i
would
the
gods
had
made
thee
poetical
i
do
not
know
what
poetical
is
is
it
honest
in
deed
and
word
is
it
a
true
thing
no
truly
for
the
truest
poetry
is
the
most
feigning
and
lovers
are
given
to
poetry
and
what
they
swear
in
poetry
may
be
said
as
lovers
they
do
feign
do
you
wish
then
that
the
gods
had
made
me
poetical
i
do
truly
for
thou
swearest
to
me
thou
art
honest
now
if
thou
wert
a
poet
i
might
have
some
hope
thou
didst
feign
would
you
not
have
me
honest
no
truly
unless
thou
wert
hardfavourd
for
honesty
coupled
to
beauty
is
to
have
honey
a
sauce
to
sugar
a
material
fool
well
i
am
not
fair
and
therefore
i
pray
the
gods
make
me
honest
truly
and
to
cast
away
honesty
upon
a
foul
slut
were
to
put
good
meat
into
an
unclean
dish
i
am
not
a
slut
though
i
thank
the
gods
i
am
foul
well
praised
be
the
gods
for
thy
foulness
sluttishness
may
come
hereafter
but
be
it
as
it
may
be
i
will
marry
thee
and
to
that
end
i
have
been
with
sir
oliver
martext
the
vicar
of
the
next
village
who
hath
promised
to
meet
me
in
this
place
of
the
forest
and
to
couple
us
i
would
fain
see
this
meeting
well
the
gods
give
us
joy
amen
a
man
may
if
he
were
of
a
fearful
heart
stagger
in
this
attempt
for
here
we
have
no
temple
but
the
wood
no
assembly
but
hornbeasts
but
what
though
courage
as
horns
are
odious
they
are
necessary
it
is
said
many
a
man
knows
no
end
of
his
goods
right
many
a
man
has
good
horns
and
knows
no
end
of
them
well
that
is
the
dowry
of
his
wife
tis
none
of
his
own
getting
horns
even
so
poor
men
alone
no
no
the
noblest
deer
hath
them
as
huge
as
the
rascal
is
the
single
man
therefore
blessed
no
as
a
walled
town
is
more
worthier
than
a
village
so
is
the
forehead
of
a
married
man
more
honourable
than
the
bare
brow
of
a
bachelor
and
by
how
much
defence
is
better
than
no
skill
by
so
much
is
a
horn
more
precious
than
to
want
here
comes
sir
oliver
sir
oliver
martext

are
well
met
will
you
dispatch
us
here
under
this
tree
or

not
take

a
toy
in
hand
here
sir
nay

covered
will
you
be
married
motley
as
the
ox
hath
his
bow
sir
the
horse
his
curb
and
the
falcon
her
bells
so
man
hath
his
desires
and
as
pigeons
bill
so
wedlock
would
be
nibbling
and
will
you
being
a
man
of
your
breeding
be
married
under
a
bush
like
a
beggar
get
you
to
church
and
have
a
good
priest
that
can
tell
you
what
marriage
is
this
fellow
will
but
join
you
together
as
they
join
wainscot
then
one
of
you
will
prove
a
shrunk
panel
and
like
green
timber
warp
warp
i
am
not
in
the
mind
but
i
were
better
to
be
married
of
him
than
of
another
for
he
is
not
like
to
marry
me
well
and
not
being
well
married
it
will
be
a
good
excuse
for
me
hereafter
to
leave
my
wife
go
thou
with
me
and
let
me
counsel
thee
come
sweet
audrey
we
must
be
married
or
we
must
live
in
bawdry
farewell
good
master
oliver
not
o
sweet
oliver
o
brave
oliver
leave
me
not
behind
thee
but
wind
away
begone
i
say
i
will
not
to
wedding
with
thee
tis
no
matter
neer
a
fantastical
knave
of
them
all
shall
flout
me
out
of
my
calling
never
talk
to
me
i
will
weep
do
i
prithee
but
yet
have
the
grace
to
consider
that
tears
do
not
become
a
man
but
have
i
not
cause
to
weep
as
good
cause
as
one
would
desire
therefore
weep
his
very
hair
is
of
the
dissembling
colour
something
browner
than
judass
marry
his
kisses
are
judass
own
children
i
faith
his
hair
is
of
a
good
colour
an
excellent
colour
your
chesnut
was
ever
the
only
colour
and
his
kissing
is
as
full
of
sanctity
as
the
touch
of
holy
bread
he
hath
bought
a
pair
of
cast
lips
of
diana
a
nun
of
winters
sisterhood
kisses
not
more
religiously
the
very
ice
of
chastity
is
in
them
but
why
did
he
swear
he
would
come
this
morning
and
comes
not
nay
certainly
there
is
no
truth
in
him
do
you
think
so
yes
i
think
he
is
not
a
pickpurse
nor
a
horsestealer
but
for
his
verity
in
love
i
do
think
him
as
concave
as
a
covered
goblet
or
a
wormeaten
nut
not
true
in
love
yes
when
he
is
in
but
i
think
he
is
not
in
you
have
heard
him
swear
downright
he
was
was
is
not
is
besides
the
oath
of
a
lover
is
no
stronger
than
the
word
of
a
tapster
they
are
both
the
confirmers
of
false
reckonings
he
attends
here
in
the
forest
on
the
duke
your
father
i
met
the
duke
yesterday
and
had
much
question
with
him
he
asked
me
of
what
parentage
i
was
i
told
him
of
as
good
as
he
so
he
laughed
and
let
me
go
but
what
talk
we
of
fathers
when
there
is
such
a
man
as
orlando
o
thats
a
brave
man
he
writes
brave
verses
speaks
brave
words
swears
brave
oaths
and
breaks
them
bravely
quite
traverse
athwart
the
heart
of
his
lover
as
a
puisny
tilter
that
spurs
his
horse
but
on
one
side
breaks
his
staff
like
a
noble
goose
but
alls
brave
that
youth
mounts
and
folly
guides
who
comes
here
mistress
and
master
you
have
oft
inquird
after
the
shepherd
that
complaind
of
love
who
you
saw
sitting
by
me
on
the
turf
praising
the
proud
disdainful
shepherdess
that
was
his
mistress
well
and
what
of
him
if
you
will
see
a
pageant
truly
playd
between
the
pale
complexion
of
true
love
and
the
red
glow
of
scorn
and
proud
disdain
go
hence
a
little
and
i
shall
conduct
you
if
you
will
mark
it
o
come
let
us
remove
the
sight
of
lovers
feedeth
those
in
love
bring
us
to
this
sight
and
you
shall
say
ill
prove
a
busy
actor
in
their
play
sweet
phebe
do
not
scorn
me
do
not
phebe
say
that
you
love
me
not
but
say
not
so
in
bitterness
the
common
executioner
whose
heart
the
accustomd
sight
of
death
makes
hard
falls
not
the
axe
upon
the
humbled
neck
but
first
begs
pardon
will
you
sterner
be
than
he
that
dies
and
lives
by
bloody
drops
i
would
not
be
thy
executioner
i
fly
thee
for
i
would
not
injure
thee
thou
tellst
me
there
is
murder
in
mine
eye
tis
pretty
sure
and
very
probable
that
eyes
that
are
the
frailst
and
softest
things
who
shut
their
coward
gates
on
atomies
should
be
calld
tyrants
butchers
murderers
now
i
do
frown
on
thee
with
all
my
heart
and
if
mine
eyes
can
wound
now
let
them
kill
thee
now
counterfeit
to
swound
why
now
fall
down
or
if
thou
canst
not
o
for
shame
for
shame
lie
not
to
say
mine
eyes
are
murderers
now
show
the
wound
mine
eye
hath
made
in
thee
scratch
thee
but
with
a
pin
and
there
remains
some
scar
of
it
lean
but
upon
a
rush
the
cicatrice
and
capable
impressure
thy
palm
some
moment
keeps
but
now
mine
eyes
which
i
have
darted
at
thee
hurt
thee
not
nor
i
am
sure
there
is
no
force
in
eyes
that
can
do
hurt
o
dear
phebe
if
ever
as
that
ever
may
be
near
you
meet
in
some
fresh
cheek
the
power
of
fancy
then
shall
you
know
the
wounds
invisible
that
loves
keen
arrows
make
but
till
that
time
come
not
thou
near
me
and
when
that
time
comes
afflict
me
with
thy
mocks
pity
me
not
as
till
that
time
i
shall
not
pity
thee
and
why
i
pray
you
who
might
be
your
mother
that
you
insult
exult
and
all
at
once
over
the
wretched
what
though
you
have
no
beauty
as
by
my
faith
i
see
no
more
in
you
than
without
candle
may
go
dark
to
bed
must
you
be
therefore
proud
and
pitiless
why
what
means
this
why
do
you
look
on
me
i
see
no
more
in
you
than
in
the
ordinary
of
natures
salework
ods
my
little
life
i
think
she
means
to
tangle
my
eyes
too
no
faith
proud
mistress
hope
not
after
it
tis
not
your
inky
brows
your
black
silk
hair
your
bugle
eyeballs
nor
your
cheek
of
cream
that
can
entame
my
spirits
to
your
worship
you
foolish
shepherd
wherefore
do
you
follow
her
like
foggy
south
puffing
with
wind
and
rain
you
are
a
thousand
times
a
properer
man
than
she
a
woman
tis
such
fools
as
you
that
make
the
world
full
of
illfavourd
children
tis
not
her
glass
but
you
that
flatters
her
and
out
of
you
she
sees
herself
more
proper
than
any
of
her
lineaments
can
show
her
but
mistress
know
yourself
down
on
your
knees
and
thank
heaven
fasting
for
a
good
mans
love
for
i
must
tell
you
friendly
in
your
ear
sell
when
you
can
you
are
not
for
all
markets
cry
the
man
mercy
love
him
take
his
offer
foul
is
most
foul
being
foul
to
be
a
scoffer
so
take
her
to
thee
shepherd
fare
you
well
sweet
youth
i
pray
you
chide
a
year
together
i
had
rather
hear
you
chide
than
this
man
woo
hes
fallen
in
love
with
her
foulness
and
shell
fall
in
love
with
my
anger
if
it
be
so
as
fast
as
she
answers
thee
with
frowning
looks
ill
sauce
her
with
bitter
words
why
look
you
so
upon
me
for
no
ill
will
i
bear
you
i
pray
you
do
not
fall
in
love
with
me
for
i
am
falser
than
vows
made
in
wine
besides
i
like
you
not
if
you
will
know
my
house
tis
at
the
tuft
of
olives
here
hard
by
will
you
go
sister
shepherd
ply
her
hard
come
sister
shepherdess
look
on
him
better
and
be
not
proud
though
all
the
world
could
see
none
could
be
so
abusd
in
sight
as
he
come
to
our
flock
dead
shepherd
now
i
find
thy
saw
of
might
who
ever
lovd
that
lovd
not
at
first
sight
sweet
phebe
ha
what
sayst
thou
silvius
sweet
phebe
pity
me
why
i
am
sorry
for
thee
gentle
silvius
wherever
sorrow
is
relief
would
be
if
you
do
sorrow
at
my
grief
in
love
by
giving
love
your
sorrow
and
my
grief
were
both
extermind
thou
hast
my
love
is
not
that
neighbourly
i
would
have
you
why
that
were
covetousness
silvius
the
time
was
that
i
hated
thee
and
yet
it
is
not
that
i
bear
thee
love
but
since
that
thou
canst
talk
of
love
so
well
thy
company
which
erst
was
irksome
to
me
i
will
endure
and
ill
employ
thee
too
but
do
not
look
for
further
recompense
than
thine
own
gladness
that
thou
art
employd
so
holy
and
so
perfect
is
my
love
and
i
in
such
a
poverty
of
grace
that
i
shall
think
it
a
most
plenteous
crop
to
glean
the
broken
ears
after
the
man
that
the
main
harvest
reaps
loose
now
and
then
a
scatterd
smile
and
that
ill
live
upon
knowst
thou
the
youth
that
spoke
to
me
erewhile
not
very
well
but
i
have
met
him
oft
and
he
hath
bought
the
cottage
and
the
bounds
that
the
old
carlot
once
was
master
of
think
not
i
love
him
though
i
ask
for
him
tis
but
a
peevish
boy
yet
he
talks
well
but
what
care
i
for
words
yet
words
do
well
when
he
that
speaks
them
pleases
those
that
hear
it
is
a
pretty
youth
not
very
pretty
but
sure
hes
proud
and
yet
his
pride
becomes
him
hell
make
a
proper
man
the
best
thing
in
him
is
his
complexion
and
faster
than
his
tongue
did
make
offence
his
eye
did
heal
it
up
he
is
not
very
tall
yet
for
his
years
hes
tall
his
leg
is
but
so
so
and
yet
tis
well
there
was
a
pretty
redness
in
his
lip
a
little
riper
and
more
lusty
red
than
that
mixd
in
his
cheek
twas
just
the
difference
betwixt
the
constant
red
and
mingled
damask
there
be
some
women
silvius
had
they
markd
him
in
parcels
as
i
did
would
have
gone
near
to
fall
in
love
with
him
but
for
my
part
i
love
him
not
nor
hate
him
not
and
yet
have
more
cause
to
hate
him
than
to
love
him
for
what
had
he
to
do
to
chide
at
me
he
said
mine
eyes
were
black
and
my
hair
black
and
now
i
am
rememberd
scornd
at
me
i
marvel
why
i
answerd
not
again
but
thats
all
one
omittance
is
no
quittance
ill
write
to
him
a
very
taunting
letter
and
thou
shalt
bear
it
wilt
thou
silvius
phebe
with
all
my
heart
ill
write
it
straight
the
matters
in
my
head
and
in
my
heart
i
will
be
bitter
with
him
and
passing
short
go
with
me
silvius
i
prithee
pretty
youth
let
me
be
better
acquainted
with
thee
they
say
you
are
a
melancholy
fellow
i
am
so
i
do
love
it
better
than
laughing
those
that
are
in
extremity
of
either
are
abominable
fellows
and
betray
themselves
to
every
modern
censure
worse
than
drunkards
why
tis
good
to
be
sad
and
say
nothing
why
then
tis
good
to
be
a
post
i
have
neither
the
scholars
melancholy
which
is
emulation
nor
the
musicians
which
is
fantastical
nor
the
courtiers
which
is
proud
nor
the
soldiers
which
is
ambitious
nor
the
lawyers
which
is
politic
nor
the
ladys
which
is
nice
nor
the
lovers
which
is
all
these
but
it
is
a
melancholy
of
mine
own
compounded
of
many
simples
extracted
from
many
objects
and
indeed
the
sundry
contemplation
of
my
travels
which
by
often
rumination
wraps
me
in
a
most
humorous
sadness
a
traveller
by
my
faith
you
have
great
reason
to
be
sad
i
fear
you
have
sold
your
own
lands
to
see
other
mens
then
to
have
seen
much
and
to
have
nothing
is
to
have
rich
eyes
and
poor
hands
yes
i
have
gained
my
experience
and
your
experience
makes
you
sad
i
had
rather
have
a
fool
to
make
me
merry
than
experience
to
make
me
sad
and
to
travel
for
it
too
good
day
and
happiness
dear
rosalind
nay
then
god
be
wi
you
an
you
talk
in
blank
verse

the
benefits

your
own
country

out
of
love
with
your
nativity
and
almost
chide
god
for
making
you
that
countenance

or

will
scarce
think
you
have
swam
in
a
gondola
why
how
now
orlando
where
have
you
been
all
this
while

a
lover
an
you
serve
me

another
trick

in
my
sight
more
my
fair
rosalind
i
come
within
an
hour
of
my
promise
break
an
hours
promise
in
love
he
that
will
divide
a
minute
into
a
thousand
parts
and
break
but
a
part
of
the
thousandth
part
of
a
minute
in
the
affairs
of
love
it
may
be
said
of
him
that
cupid
hath
clapped
him
o
the
shoulder
but
ill
warrant
him
heartwhole
pardon
me
dear
rosalind
nay
an
you
be
so
tardy
come
no
more
in
my
sight
i
had
as
lief
be
wooed
of
a
snail
of
a
snail
ay
of
a
snail
for
though
he
comes
slowly
he
carries
his
house
on
his
head
a
better
jointure
i
think
than
you
make
a
woman
besides
he
brings
his
destiny
with
him
whats
that
why
horns
that
such
as
you
are
fain
to
be
beholding
to
your
wives
for
but
he
comes
armed
in
his
fortune
and
prevents
the
slander
of
his
wife
virtue
is
no
hornmaker
and
my
rosalind
is
virtuous
and
i
am
your
rosalind
it
pleases
him
to
call
you
so
but
he
hath
a
rosalind
of
a
better
leer
than
you
come
woo
me
woo
me
for
now
i
am
in
a
holiday
humour
and
like
enough
to
consent
what
would
you
say
to
me
now
an
i
were
your
very
very
rosalind
i
would
kiss
before
i
spoke
nay
you
were
better
speak
first
and
when
you
were
gravelled
for
lack
of
matter
you
might
take
occasion
to
kiss
very
good
orators
when
they
are
out
they
will
spit
and
for
lovers
lacking
god
warn
us
matter
the
cleanliest
shift
is
to
kiss
how
if
the
kiss
be
denied
then
she
puts
you
to
entreaty
and
there
begins
new
matter
who
could
be
out
being
before
his
beloved
mistress
marry
that
should
you
if
i
were
your
mistress
or
i
should
think
my
honesty
ranker
than
my
wit
what
of
my
suit
not
out
of
your
apparel
and
yet
out
of
your
suit
am
not
i
your
rosalind
i
take
some
joy
to
say
you
are
because
i
would
be
talking
of
her
well
in
her
person
i
say
i
will
not
have
you
then
in
mine
own
person
i
die
no
faith
die
by
attorney
the
poor
world
is
almost
six
thousand
years
old
and
in
all
this
time
there
was
not
any
man
died
in
his
own
person
videlicet
in
a
lovecause
troilus
had
his
brains
dashed
out
with
a
grecian
club
yet
he
did
what
he
could
to
die
before
and
he
is
one
of
the
patterns
of
love
leander
he
would
have
lived
many
a
fair
year
though
hero
had
turned
nun
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
hot
midsummer
night
for
good
youth
he
went
but
forth
to
wash
him
in
the
hellespont
and
being
taken
with
the
cramp
was
drowned
and
the
foolish
coroners
of
that
age
found
it
was
hero
of
sestos
but
these
are
all
lies
men
have
died
from
time
to
time
and
worms
have
eaten
them
but
not
for
love
i
would
not
have
my
right
rosalind
of
this
mind
for
i
protest
her
frown
might
kill
me
by
this
hand
it
will
not
kill
a
fly
but
come
now
i
will
be
your
rosalind
in
a
more
comingon
disposition
and
ask
me
what
you
will
i
will
grant
it
then
love
me
rosalind
yes
faith
will
i
fridays
and
saturdays
and
all
and
wilt
thou
have
me
ay
and
twenty
such
what
sayest
thou
are
you
not
good
i
hope
so
why
then
can
one
desire
too
much
of
a
good
thing
come
sister

shall
be
the
priest
and
marry
us
give
me
your
hand
orlando
what
do

cannot
say
the
words

must
begin
will
you
orlando
go
to
will
you
orlando
have
to
wife
this
rosalind
i
will
ay
but
when
why
now
as
fast
as
she
can
marry
us
then
you
must
say
i
take
thee
rosalind
for
wife
i
take
thee
rosalind
for
wife
i
might
ask
you
for
your
commission
but
i
do
take
thee
orlando
for
my
husband
theres
a
girl
goes
before
the
priest
and
certainly
a
womans
thought
runs
before
her
actions
so
do
all
thoughts
they
are
winged
now
tell
me
how
long
you
would
have
her
after
you
have
possessed
her
for
ever
and
a
day
say
a
day
without
the
ever
no
no
orlando
men
are
april
when
they
woo
december
when
they
wed
maids
are
may
when
they
are
maids
but
the
sky
changes
when
they
are
wives
i
will
be
more
jealous
of
thee
than
a
barbary
cockpigeon
over
his
hen
more
clamorous
than
a
parrot
against
rain
more
newfangled
than
an
ape
more
giddy
in
my
desires
than
a
monkey
i
will
weep
for
nothing
like
diana
in
the
fountain
and
i
will
do
that
when
you
are
disposed
to
be
merry
i
will
laugh
like
a
hyen
and
that
when
thou
art
inclined
to
sleep
but
will
my
rosalind
do
so
by
my
life
she
will
do
as
i
do
o
but
she
is
wise
or
else
she
could
not
have
the
wit
to
do
this
the
wiser
the
waywarder
make
the
doors
upon
a
womans
wit
and
it
will
out
at
the
casement
shut
that
and
twill
out
at
the
keyhole
stop
that
twill
fly
with
the
smoke
out
at
the
chimney
a
man
that
hath
a
wife
with
such
a
wit
he
might
say
wit
whither
wilt
nay
you
might
keep
that
check
for
it
till
you
met
your
wifes
wit
going
to
your
neighbours
bed
and
what
wit
could
wit
have
to
excuse
that
marry
to
say
she
came
to
seek
you
there
you
shall
never
take
her
without
her
answer
unless
you
take
her
without
her
tongue
o
that
woman
that
cannot
make
her
fault
her
husbands
occasion
let
her
never
nurse
her
child
herself
for
she
will
breed
it
like
a
fool
for
these
two
hours
rosalind
i
will
leave
thee
alas
dear
love
i
cannot
lack
thee
two
hours
i
must
attend
the
duke
at
dinner
by
two
oclock
i
will
be
with
thee
again
ay
go
your
ways
go
your
ways
i
knew
what
you
would
prove
my
friends
told
me
as
much
and
i
thought
no
less
that
flattering
tongue
of
yours
won
me
tis
but
one
cast
away
and
so
come
death
two
oclock
is
your
hour
ay
sweet
rosalind
by
my
troth
and
in
good
earnest
and
so
god
mend
me
and
by
all
pretty
oaths
that
are
not
dangerous
if
you
break
one
jot
of
your
promise
or
come
one
minute
behind
your
hour
i
will
think
you
the
most
pathetical
breakpromise
and
the
most
hollow
lover
and
the
most
unworthy
of
her
you
call
rosalind
that
may
be
chosen
out
of
the
gross
band
of
the
unfaithful
therefore
beware
my
censure
and
keep
your
promise
with
no
less
religion
than
if
thou
wert
indeed
my
rosalind
so
adieu
well
time
is
the
old
justice
that
examines
all
such
offenders
and
let
time
try
adieu
you
have
simply
misused
our
sex
in
your
loveprate
we
must
have
your
doublot
and
hose
plucked
over
your
head
and
show
the
world
what
the
bird
hath
done
to
her
own
nest
o
coz
coz
coz
my
pretty
little
coz
that
thou
didst
know
how
many
fathom
deep
i
am
in
love
but
it
cannot
be
sounded
my
affection
hath
an
unknown
bottom
like
the
bay
of
portugal
or
rather
bottomless
that
as
fast
as
you
pour
affection
in
it
runs
out
no
that
same
wicked
bastard
of
venus
that
was
begot
of
thought
conceived
of
spleen
and
born
of
madness
that
blind
rascally
boy
that
abuses
every
ones
eyes
because
his
own
are
out
let
him
be
judge
how
deep
i
am
in
love
ill
tell
thee
aliena
i
cannot
be
out
of
the
sight
of
orlando
ill
go
find
a
shadow
and
sigh
till
he
come
and
ill
sleep
which
is
he
that
killed
the
deer
sir
it
was
i
lets
present
him
to
the
duke
like
a
roman
conqueror
and
it
would
do
well
to
set
the
deers
horns
upon
his
head
for
a
branch
of
victory
have
you
no
song
forester
for
this
purpose
yes
sir
sing
it
tis
no
matter
how
it
be
in
tune
so
it
make
noise
enough
what
shall
he
have
that
killd
the
deer
his
leather
skin
and
horns
to
wear
then
sing
him
home
take
thou
no
scorn
to
wear
the
horn
it
was
a
crest
ere
thou
wast
born
thy
fathers
father
wore
it
and
thy
father
bore
it
the
horn
the
horn
the
lusty
horn
is
not
a
thing
to
laugh
to
scorn
how
say
you
now
is
it
not
past
two
oclock
and
here
much
orlando
i
warrant
you
with
pure
love
and
a
troubled
brain
he
hath
taen
his
bow
and
arrows
and
is
gone
forth
to
sleep
look
who
comes
here
my
errand
is
to
you
fair
youth
my
gentle
phebe
did
bid
me
give
you
this
i
know
not
the
contents
but
as
i
guess
by
the
stern
brow
and
waspish
action
which
she
did
use
as
she
was
writing
of
it
it
bears
an
angry
tenour
pardon
me
i
am
but
as
a
guiltless
messenger
patience
herself
would
startle
at
this
letter
and
play
the
swaggerer
bear
this
bear
all
she
says
i
am
not
fair
that
i
lack
manners
she
calls
me
proud
and
that
she
could
not
love
me
were
man
as
rare
as
ph
nix
ods
my
will
her
love
is
not
the
hare
that
i
do
hunt
why
writes
she
so
to
me
well
shepherd
well
this
is
a
letter
of
your
own
device
no
i
protest
i
know
not
the
contents
phebe
did
write
it
come
come
you
are
a
fool
and
turnd
into
the
extremity
of
love
i
saw
her
hand
she
has
a
leathern
hand
a
freestonecolourd
hand
i
verily
did
think
that
her
old
gloves
were
on
but
twas
her
hands
she
has
a
housewifes
hand
but
thats
no
matter
i
say
she
never
did
invent
this
letter
this
is
a
mans
invention
and
his
hand
sure
it
is
hers
why
tis
a
boisterous
and
a
cruel
style
a
style
for
challengers
why
she
defies
me
like
turk
to
christian
womans
gentle
brain
could
not
drop
forth
such
giantrude
invention
such
ethiop
words
blacker
in
their
effect
than
in
their
countenance
will
you
hear
the
letter
so
please
you
for
i
never
heard
it
yet
yet
heard
too
much
of
phebes
cruelty
she
phebes
me
mark
how
the
tyrant
writes
art
thou
god
to
shepherd
turnd
that
a
maidens
heart
hath
burnd
can
a
woman
rail
thus
call
you
this
railing
why
thy
godhead
laid
apart
warrst
thou
with
a
womans
heart
did
you
ever
hear
such
railing
whiles
the
eye
of
man
did
woo
me
that
could
do
no
vengeance
to
me
meaning
me
a
beast
if
the
scorn
of
your
bright
eyne
have
power
to
raise
such
love
in
mine
alack
in
me
what
strange
effect
would
they
work
in
mild
aspect
whiles
you
chid
me
i
did
love
how
then
might
your
prayers
move
he
that
brings
this
love
to
thee
little
knows
this
love
in
me
and
by
him
seal
up
thy
mind
whether
that
thy
youth
and
kind
will
the
faithful
offer
take
of
me
and
all
that
i
can
make
or
else
by
him
my
love
deny
and
then
ill
study
how
to
die
call
you
this
chiding
alas
poor
shepherd
do
you
pity
him
no
he
deserves
no
pity
wilt
thou
love
such
a
woman
what
to
make
thee
an
instrument
and
play
false
strains
upon
thee
not
to
be
endured
well
go
your
way
to
her
for
i
see
love
hath
made
thee
a
tame
snake
and
say
this
to
her
that
if
she
love
me
i
charge
her
to
love
thee
if
she
will
not
i
will
never
have
her
unless
thou
entreat
for
her
if
you
be
a
true
lover
hence
and
not
a
word
for
here
comes
more
company
good
morrow
fair
ones
pray
you
if
you
know
where
in
the
purlieus
of
this
forest
stands
a
sheepcote
fencd
about
with
olivetrees
west
of
this
place
down
in
the
neighbour
bottom
the
rank
of
osiers
by
the
murmuring
stream
left
on
your
right
hand
brings
you
to
the
place
but
at
this
hour
the
house
doth
keep
itself
theres
none
within
if
that
an
eye
may
profit
by
a
tongue
then
should
i
know
you
by
description
such
garments
and
such
years
the
boy
is
fair
of
female
favour
and
bestows
himself
like
a
ripe
sister
but
the
woman
low
and
browner
than
her
brother
are
not
you
the
owner
of
the
house
i
did
inquire
for
it
is
no
boast
being
askd
to
say
we
are
orlando
doth
commend
him
to
you
both
and
to
that
youth
he
calls
his
rosalind
he
sends
this
bloody
napkin
are
you
he
i
am
what
must
we
understand
by
this
some
of
my
shame
if
you
will
know
of
me
what
man
i
am
and
how
and
why
and
where
this
handkercher
was
staind
i
pray
you
tell
it
when
last
the
young
orlando
parted
from
you
he
left
a
promise
to
return
again
within
an
hour
and
pacing
through
the
forest
chewing
the
food
of
sweet
and
bitter
fancy
lo
what
befell
he
threw
his
eye
aside
and
mark
what
object
did
present
itself
under
an
oak
whose
boughs
were
mossd
with
age
and
high
top
bald
with
dry
antiquity
a
wretched
ragged
man
oergrown
with
hair
lay
sleeping
on
his
back
about
his
neck
a
green
and
gilded
snake
had
wreathd
itself
who
with
her
head
nimble
in
threats
approachd
the
opening
of
his
mouth
but
suddenly
seeing
orlando
it
unlinkd
itself
and
with
indented
glides
did
slip
away
into
a
bush
under
which
bushs
shade
a
lioness
with
udders
all
drawn
dry
lay
couching
head
on
ground
with
catlike
watch
when
that
the
sleeping
man
should
stir
for
tis
the
royal
disposition
of
that
beast
to
prey
on
nothing
that
doth
seem
as
dead
this
seen
orlando
did
approach
the
man
and
found
it
was
his
brother
his
elder
brother
o
i
have
heard
him
speak
of
that
same
brother
and
he
did
render
him
the
most
unnatural
that
livd
mongst
men
and
well
he
might
so
do
for
well
i
know
he
was
unnatural
but
to
orlando
did
he
leave
him
there
food
to
the
suckd
and
hungry
lioness
twice
did
he
turn
his
back
and
purposd
so
but
kindness
nobler
ever
than
revenge
and
nature
stronger
than
his
just
occasion
made
him
give
battle
to
the
lioness
who
quickly
fell
before
him
in
which
hurtling
from
miserable
slumber
i
awakd
are
you
his
brother
was
it
you
he
rescud
wast
you
that

of
a
lady

and

wonders

sooner
loved
but
they
sighed
no
sooner
sighed
but
they
asked
one
another
the
reason
no
sooner
knew
the
reason
but
they
sought
the
remedy
and
in
these
degrees
have
they
made
a
pair
of
stairs
to
marriage
which
they
will
climb
incontinent
or
else
be
incontinent
before
marriage
they
are
in
the
very
wrath
of
love
and
they
will
together
clubs
cannot
part
them
they
shall
be
married
tomorrow
and
i
will
bid
the
duke
to
the
nuptial
but
o
how
bitter
a
thing
it
is
to
look
into
happiness
through
another
mans
eyes
by
so
much
the
more
shall
i
tomorrow
be
at
the
height
of
heartheaviness
by
how
much
i
shall
think
my
brother

what
he
wishes
for
why
then
tomorrow
i
cannot
serve
your
turn
for
rosalind
i
can
live
no
longer
by
thinking
i
will
weary
you
then
no
longer
with
idle
talking
know
of
me
then
for
now
i
speak
to
some
purpose
that
i
know
you
are
a
gentleman
of
good
conceit
i
speak
not
this
that
you
should
bear
a
good
opinion
of
my
knowledge
insomuch
i
say
i
know
you
are
neither
do
i
labour
for
a
greater
esteem
than
may
in
some
little
measure
draw
a
belief
from
you
to
do
yourself
good
and
not
to
grace
me
believe
then
if
you
please
that
i
can
do
strange
things
i
have
since
i
was
three
years
old
conversed
with
a
magician
most
profound
in
his
art
and
yet
not
damnable
if
you
do
love
rosalind
so
near
the
heart
as
your
gesture
cries
it
out
when
your
brother
marries
aliena
shall
you
marry
her
i
know
into
what
straits
of
fortune
she
is
driven
and
it
is
not
impossible
to
me
if
it
appear
not
inconvenient
to
you
to
set
her
before
your
eyes
tomorrow
human
as
she
is
and
without
any
danger
speakest
thou
in
sober
meanings
by
my
life
i
do
which
i
tender
dearly
though
i
say
i
am
a
magician
therefore
put
you
in
your
best
array
bid
your
friends
for
if
you
will
be
married

my
study

prologues
to

bad
voice
ifaith

tune
like
two
gipsies
on
a
horse

was
a
lover
and
his
lass
with
a
hey
and
a
ho
and
a
hey
nonino
that
oer
the
green
cornfield
did

ding
ding
sweet
lovers

spring
between
the
acres
of
the
rye
with

pretty
country
folks

spring
time

began
that
hour
with
a
hey
and
a
ho
and
a
hey
nonino
how
that
a
life
was
but
a
flower

with
the
prime
in
the
spring
time
c
truly
young
gentlemen

no
great
matter
in
the
ditty

kept
time
we
lost
not
our
time
by
my
troth

but
time

a
foolish
song

your
voices
come
audrey
dost
thou
believe
orlando
that
the
boy
can
do
all
this
that
he
hath
promised
i
sometimes
do
believe
and
sometimes
do
not
as
those
that
fear
they
hope
and
know
they
fear
patience
once
more
whiles
our
compact
is
urgd
you
say
if
i
bring
in
your
rosalind
you

bestow
her
on
orlando
here
that

her
when

of

kingdoms
king
you
say
that
youll
marry
me
if

be
willing
that

the
hour
after
but
if
you
do
refuse
to
marry
me
youll
give
yourself
to
this
most
faithful
shepherd
so
is
the
bargain
you
say
that
youll
have
phebe
if

will
though
to
have
her
and
death
were
both
one
thing

and
from
hence
i
go
to
make
these
doubts
all
even
i
do
remember
in
this
shepherd
boy
some
lively
touches
of
my
daughters
favour
my
lord
the
first
time
that
i
ever
saw
him
methought
he
was
a
brother
to
your
daughter
but
my
good
lord
this
boy
is
forestborn
and
hath
been
tutord
in
the
rudiments
of
many
desperate
studies
by
his
uncle
whom
he
reports
to
be
a
great
magician
obscured
in
the
circle
of
this
forest
there
is
sure
another
flood
toward
and
these
couples
are
coming
to
the
ark
here
comes
a
pair
of
very
strange
beasts
which
in
all
tongues
are
called
fools
salutation
and
greeting
to
you
all
good
my
lord
bid
him
welcome
this
is
the
motleyminded
gentleman
that
i
have
so
often
met
in
the
forest
he
hath
been
a
courtier
he
swears
if
any
man
doubt
that
let
him
put
me
to
my
purgation
i
have
trod
a
measure
i
have
flattered
a
lady
i
have
been
politic
with
my
friend
smooth
with
mine
enemy
i
have
undone
three
tailors
i
have
had
four
quarrels
and
like
to
have
fought
one
and
how
was
that
taen
up
faith
we
met
and
found
the
quarrel
was
upon
the
seventh
cause
how
seventh
cause
good
my
lord
like
this
fellow
i
like
him
very
well
god
ild
you
sir
i
desire
you
of
the
like
i
press
in
here
sir
amongst
the
rest
of
the
country
copulatives
to
swear
and
to
forswear
according
as
marriage
binds
and
blood
breaks
a
poor
virgin
sir
an
illfavoured
thing
sir
but
mine
own
a
poor
humour
of
mine
sir
to
take
that
that
no
man
else
will
rich
honesty
dwells
like
a
miser
sir
in
a
poor
house
as
your
pearl
in
your
foul
oyster
by
my
faith
he
is
very
swift
and
sententious
according
to
the
fools
bolt
sir
and
such
dulcet
diseases
but
for
the
seventh
cause
how
did
you
find
the
quarrel
on
the
seventh
cause
upon
a
lie
seven
times
removed
bear
your
body
more
seeming
audrey
as
thus
sir
i
did
dislike
the
cut
of
a
certain
courtiers
beard
he
sent
me
word
if
i
said
his
beard
was
not
cut
well
he
was
in
the
mind
it
was
this
is
called
the
retort
courteous
if
i
sent
him
word
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
would
send
me
word
he
cut
it
to
please
himself
this
is
called
the
quip
modest
if
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
disabled
my
judgment
this
is
called
the
reply
churlish
if
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
would
answer
i
spake
not
true
this
is
called
the
reproof
valiant
if
again
it
was
not
well
cut
he
would
say
i
lie
this
is
called
the
countercheck
quarrelsome
and
so
to
the
lie
circumstantial
and
the
lie
direct
and
how
oft
did
you
say
his
beard
was
not
well
cut
i
durst
go
no
further
than
the
lie
circumstantial
nor
he
durst
not
give
me
the
lie
direct
and
so
we
measured
swords
and
parted
can
you
nominate
in
order
now
the
degrees
of
the
lie
o
sir
we
quarrel
in
print
by
the
book
as
you
have
books
for
good
manners
i
will
name
you
the
degrees
the
first
the
retort
courteous
the
second
the
quip
modest
the
third
the
reply
churlish
the
fourth
the
reproof
valiant
the
fifth
the
countercheck
quarrelsome
the
sixth
the
lie
with
circumstance
the
seventh
the
lie
direct
all
these
you
may
avoid
but
the
lie
direct
and
you
may
avoid
that
too
with
an
if
i
knew
when
seven
justices
could
not
take
up
a
quarrel
but
when
the
parties
were
met
themselves
one
of
them
thought
but
of
an
if
as
if
you
said
so
then
i
said
so
and
they
shook
hands
and
swore
brothers
your
if
is
the
only
peacemaker
much
virtue
in
if
is
not
this
a
rare
fellow
my
lord
hes
as
good
at
any
thing
and
yet
a
fool
he
uses
his
folly
like
a
stalkinghorse
and
under
the
presentation
of
that
he
shoots
his
wit
then
is
there
mirth
in

audience
for

word
or
two
i
am
the
second
son
of
old
sir
rowland
that
bring
these
tidings
to
this
fair
assembly
duke
frederick
hearing
how
that
every
day
men
of
great
worth
resorted
to
this
forest
addressd
a
mighty
power
which
were
on
foot
in
his
own
conduct
purposely
to
take
his
brother
here
and
put
him
to
the
sword
and
to
the
skirts
of
this
wild
wood
he
came
where
meeting
with
an
old
religious
man
after
some
question
with
him
was
converted
both
from
his
enterprise
and
from
the
world
his
crown
bequeathing
to
his
banishd
brother
and
all
their
lands
restord
to
them
again
that
were
with
him
exild
this
to
be
true
i
do
engage
my
life
welcome
young
man
thou
offerst
fairly
to
thy
brothers
wedding
to
one
his
lands
withheld
and
to
the
other
a
land
itself
at
large
a
potent
dukedom
first
in
this
forest
let
us
do
those
ends
that
here
were
well
begun
and
well
begot
and
after
every
of
this
happy
number
that
have
endurd
shrewd
days
and
nights
with
us
shall
share
the
good
of
our
returned
fortune
according
to
the
measure
of
their
states
meantime
forget
this
newfalln
dignity
and
fall
into
our
rustic
revelry
play
music
and
you
brides
and
bridegrooms
all
with
measure
heapd
in
joy
to
the
measures
fall
sir
by
your
patience
if
i
heard
you
rightly
the
duke
hath
put
on
a
religious
life
and
thrown
into
neglect
the
pompous
court
he
hath
to
him
will
i
out
of
these
convertites
there
is
much
matter
to
be
heard
and
learnd
you
to
your
former
honour
i
bequeath
your
patience
and
your
virtue
well
deserve
it
you
to
a
love
that
your
true
faith
doth
merit
you
to
your
land
and
love
and
great
allies
you
to
a
long
and
welldeserved
bed
and
you
to
wrangling
for
thy
loving
voyage
is
but
for
two
months
victuald
so
to
your
pleasures
i
am
for
other
than
for
dancing
measures
stay
jaques
stay
to
see
no
pastime
i
what
you
would
have
ill
stay
to
know
at
your
abandond
cave
proceed
proceed
we
will
begin
these
rites
as
we
do
trust
theyll
end
in
true
delights
it
is
not
the
fashion
to
see
the
lady
the
epilogue
but
it
is
no
more
unhandsome
than
to
see
the
lord
the
prologue
if
it
be
true
that
good
wine
needs
no
bush
tis
true
that
a
good
play
needs
no
epilogue
yet
to
good
wine
they
do
use
good
bushes
and
good
plays
prove
the
better
by
the
help
of
good
epilogues
what
a
case
am
i
in
then
that
am
neither
a
good
epilogue
nor
cannot
insinuate
with
you
in
the
behalf
of
a
good
play
i
am
not
furnished
like
a
beggar
therefore
to
beg
will
not
become
me
my
way
is
to
conjure
you
and
ill
begin
with
the
women
i
charge
you
o
women
for
the
love
you
bear
to
men
to
like
as
much
of
this
play
as
please
you
and
i
charge
you
o
men
for
the
love
you
bear
to
women
as
i
perceive
by
your
simpering
none
of
you
hate
them
that
between
you
and
the
women
the
play
may
please
if
i
were
a
woman
i
would
kiss
as
many
of
you
as
had
beards
that
pleased
me
complexions
that
liked
me
and
breaths
that
i
defied
not
and
i
am
sure
as
many
as
have
good
beards
or
good
faces
or
sweet
breaths
will
for
my
kind
offer
when
i
make
curtsy
bid
me
farewell
cymbeline
you
do
not
meet
a
man
but
frowns
our
bloods
no
more
obey
the
heavens
than
our
courtiers
still
seem
as
does
the
king
but
whats
the
matter
his
daughter
and
the
heir
of
s
kingdom
whom
he
purposd
to
his
wifes
sole
son
a
widow
that
late
he
married
hath
referrd
herself
unto
a
poor
but
worthy
gentleman
shes
wedded
her
husband
banishd
she
imprisond
all
is
outward
sorrow
though
i
think
the
king
be
touchd
at
very
heart
none
but
the
king
he
that
hath
lost
her
too
so
is
the
queen
that
most
desird
the
match
but
not
a
courtier
although
they
wear
their
faces
to
the
bent
of
the
kings
looks
hath
a
heart
that
is
not
glad
at
the
thing
they
scowl
at
and
why
so
he
that
hath
missd
the
princess
is
a
thing
too
bad
for
bad
report
and
he
that
hath
her
i
mean
that
married
her
alack
good
man
and
therefore
banishd
is
a
creature
such
as
to
seek
through
the
regions
of
the
earth
for
one
his
like
there
would
be
something
failing
in
him
that
should
compare
i
do
not
think
so
fair
an
outward
and
such
stuff
within
endows
a
man
but
he
you
speak
him
far
i
do
extend
him
sir
within
himself
crush
him
together
rather
than
unfold
his
measure
duly
whats
his
name
and
birth
i
cannot
delve
him
to
the
root
his
father
was
called
sicilius
who
did
join
his
honour
against
the
romans
with
cassibelan
but
had
his
titles
by
tenantius
whom
he
servd
with
glory
and
admird
success
so
gaind
the
suraddition
leonatus
and
had
besides
this
gentleman
in
question
two
other
sons
who
in
the
wars
o
the
time
died
with
their
swords
in
hand
for
which
their
father
then
old
and
fond
of
issue
took
such
sorrow
that
he
quit
being
and
his
gentle
lady
big
of
this
gentleman
our
theme
deceasd
as
he
was
born
the
king
he
takes
the
babe
to
his
protection
calls
him
posthumus
leonatus
breeds
him
and
makes
him
of
his
bedchamber
puts
to
him
all
the
learnings
that
his
time
could
make
him
the
receiver
of
which
he
took
as
we
do
air
fast
as
twas
ministerd
and
ins
spring
became
a
harvest
livd
in
court
which
rare
it
is
to
do
most
praisd
most
lovd
a
sample
to
the
youngest
to
the
more
mature
a
glass
that
feated
them
and
to
the
graver
a
child
that
guided
dotards
to
his
mistress
for
whom
he
now
is
banishd
her
own
price
proclaims
how
she
esteemd
him
and
his
virtue
by
her
election
may
be
truly
read
what
kind
of
man
he
is
i
honour
him
even
out
of
your
report
but
pray
you
tell
me
is
she
sole
child
to
the
king
his
only
child
he
had
twosons
if
this
be
worth
your
hearing
mark
it
the
eldest
of
them
at
three
years
old
i
the
swathing
clothes
the
other
from
their
nursery
were
stoln
and
to
this
hour
no
guess
in
knowledge
which
way
they
went
how
long
is
this
ago
some
twenty
years
that
a
kings
children
should
be
so
conveyd
so
slackly
guarded
and
the
search
so
slow
that
could
not
trace
them
howsoeer
tis
strange
or
that
the
negligence
may
well
be
laughd
at
yet
is
it
true
sir
i
do
well
believe
you
we
must
forbear
here
comes
the
gentleman
the
queen
and
princess
no
be
assurd
you
shall
not
find
me
daughter
after
the
slander
of
most
stepmothers
evileyd
unto
you
youre
my
prisoner
but
your
gaoler
shall
deliver
you
the
keys
that
lock
up
your
restraint
for
you
posthumus
so
soon
as
i
can
win
the
offended
king
i
will
be
known
your
advocate
marry
yet
the
fire
of
rage
is
in
him
and
twere
good
you
leand
unto
his
sentence
with
what
patience
your
wisdom
may
inform
you
please
your
highness
i
will
from
hence
today
you
know
the
peril
ill
fetch
a
turn
about
the
garden
pitying
the
pangs
of
barrd
affections
though
the
king
hath
chargd
you
should
not
speak
together
o
dissembling
courtesy
how
fine
this
tyrant
can
tickle
where
she
wounds
my
dearest
husband
i
something
fear
my
fathers
wrath
but
nothing
always
reservd
my
holy
duty
what
his
rage
can
do
on
me
you
must
be
gone
and
i
shall
here
abide
the
hourly
shot
of
angry
eyes
not
comforted
to
live
but
that
there
is
this
jewel
in
the
world
that
i
may
see
again
my
queen
my
mistress
o
lady
weep
no
more
lest
i
give
cause
to
be
suspected
of
more
tenderness
than
doth
become
a
man
i
will
remain
the
loyalst
husband
that
did
eer
plight
troth
my
residence
in
rome
at
one
philarios
who
to
my
father
was
a
friend
to
me
known
but
by
letter
thither
write
my
queen
and
with
mine
eyes
ill
drink
the
words
you
send
though
ink
be
made
of
gall
be
brief
i
pray
you
if
the
king
come
i
shall
incur
i
know
not
how
much
of
his
displeasure
yet
ill
move
him
to
walk
this
way
i
never
do
him
wrong
but
he
does
buy
my
injuries
to
be
friends
pays
dear
for
my
offences
should
we
be
taking
leave
as
long
a
term
as
yet
we
have
to
live
the
loathness
to
depart
would
grow
adieu
nay
stay
a
little
were
you
but
riding
forth
to
air
yourself
such
parting
were
too
petty
look
here
love
this
diamond
was
my
mothers
take
it
heart
but
keep
it
till
you
woo
another
wife
when
imogen
is
dead
how
how
another
you
gentle
gods
give
me
but
this
i
have
and
sear
up
my
embracements
from
a
next
with
bonds
of
death

thou
here
while
sense
can
keep
it
on
and
sweetest
fairest
as
i
my
poor
self
did
exchange
for
you
to
your
so
infinite
loss
so
in
our
trifles
i
still
win
of
you
for
my
sake
wear
this
it
is
a
manacle
of
love
ill
place
it
upon
this
fairest
prisoner
o
the
gods
when
shall
we
see
again
alack
the
king
thou
basest
thing
avoid
hence
from
my
sight
if
after
this
command
thou
fraught
the
court
with
thy
unworthiness
thou
diest
away
thourt
poison
to
my
blood
the
gods
protect
you
and
bless
the
good
remainders
of
the
court
i
am
gone

cannot
be
a
pinch
in
death
more
sharp
than
this

o
disloyal
thing
that
shouldst
repair
my
youth
thou
heapst
instead
a
years
age
on
me
i
beseech
you
sir

with
your
vexation

am
senseless
of
your
wrath

touch
more
rare

all
pangs
all
fears
past
grace
obedience
past
hope
and
in
despair
that
way
past
grace
that
mightst
have
had
the
sole
son
of
my
queen
o
blessd
that
i
might
not
i
chose
an
eagle
and
did
avoid
a
puttock
thou
tookst
a
beggar
wouldst
have
made
my
throne
a
seat
for
baseness
no
i
rather
added
a
lustre
to
it
o
thou
vile
one
sir
it
is
your
fault
that
i
have
lovd
posthumus
you
bred
him
as
my
playfellow
and
he
is
a
man
worth
any
woman

sum

glad

his
command

a
sacrifice

none
abroad
so
wholesome
as
that
you
vent
if
my
shirt

to
shift

i
hurt
him
no
faith

so
much
as

him
his
bodys
a
passable
carcass
if
he
be
not
hurt
it
is
a
throughfare
for
steel
if
it
be
not
hurt
his
steel
was
in
debt
it
went
o
the
backside
the
town
the
villain
would
not
stand
me
no
but
he
fled
forward
still
toward
your
face
stand
you
you
have
land
enough
of
your
own
but
he
added
to
your
having
gave
you
some
ground
as
many
inches
as
you
have
oceans
puppies
i
would
they
had
not
come
between
us
so
would
i
till
you
had
measured
how
long
a
fool
you
were
upon
the
ground
and
that
she
should
love
this
fellow
and
refuse
me
if
it
be
a
sin
to
make
a
true
election
she
is
damned
sir
as
i
told
you
always
her
beauty
and
her
brain
go
not
together
shes
a
good
sign
but
i
have
seen
small
reflection
of
her
wit
she
shines
not
upon
fools
lest
the
reflection
should
hurt
her
come
ill
to
my
chamber
would
there
had
been
some
hurt
done
i
wish
not
so
unless
it
had
been
the
fall
of
an
ass
which
is
no
great
hurt
youll
go
with
us
ill
attend
your
lordship
nay
come
lets
go
together
well
my
lord
i
would
thou
grewst
unto
the
shores
of
the
haven
and
questiondst
every
sail
if
he
should
write
and
i
not
have
it
twere
a
paper
lost
as
offerd
mercy
is
what
was
the
last
that
he
spake
to
thee
it
was
his
queen
his
queen
then
wavd
his
handkerchief
and
kissd
it
madam
senseless
linen
happier
therein
than
i
and
that
was
all
no
madam
for
so
long
as
he
could
make
me
with
this
eye
or
ear
distinguish
him
from
others
he
did
keep
the
deck
with
glove
or
hat
or
handkerchief
still
waving
as
the
fits
and
stirs
of
s
mind
could
best
express
how
slow
his
soul
saild
on
how
swift
his
ship
thou
shouldst
have
made
him
as
little
as
a
crow
or
less
ere
left
to
aftereye
him
madam
so
i
did
i
would
have
broke
mine
eyestrings
crackd
them
but
to
look
upon
him
till
the
diminution
of
space
had
pointed
him
sharp
as
my
needle
nay
followd
him
till
he
had
melted
from
the
smallness
of
a
gnat
to
air
and
then
have
turnd
mine
eye
and
wept
but
good
pisanio
when
shall
we
hear
from
him
be
assurd
madam
with
his
next
vantage
i
did
not
take
my
leave
of
him
but
had
most
pretty
things
to
say
ere
i
could
tell
him
how
i
would
think
on
him
at
certain
hours
such
thoughts
and
such
or
i
could
make
him
swear
the
shes
of
italy
should
not
betray
mine
interest
and
his
honour
or
have
chargd
him
at
the
sixth
hour
of
morn
at
noon
at
midnight
to
encounter
me
with
orisons
for
then
i
am
in
heaven
for
him
or
ere
i
could
give
him
that
parting
kiss
which
i
had
set
betwixt
two
charming
words
comes
in
my
father
and
like
the
tyrannous
breathing
of
the
north
shakes
all
our
buds
from
growing
the
queen
madam
desires
your
highness
company
those
things
i
bid
you
do
get
them
dispatchd
i
will
attend
the
queen
madam
i
shall
believe
it
sir
i
have
seen
him
in
britain
he
was
then
of
a
crescent
note
expected
to
prove
so
worthy
as
since
he
hath
been
allowed
the
name
of
but
i
could
then
have
looked
on
him
without
the
help
of
admiration
though
the
catalogue
of
his
endowments
had
been
tabled
by
his
side
and
i
to
peruse
him
by
items
you
speak
of
him
when
he
was
less
furnished
than
now
he
is
with
that
which
makes
him
both
without
and
within
i
have
seen
him
in
france
we
had
very
many
there
could
behold
the
sun
with
as
firm
eyes
as
he
this
matter
of
marrying
his
kings
daughter
wherein
he
must
be
weighed
rather
by
her
value
than
his
own
words
him
i
doubt
not
a
great
deal
from
the
matter
and
then
his
banishment
ay
and
the
approbation
of
those
that
weep
this
lamentable
divorce
under
her
colours
are
wonderfully
to
extend
him
be
it
but
to
fortify
her
judgment
which
else
an
easy
battery
might
lay
flat
for
taking
a
beggar
without
less
quality
but
how
comes
it
he
is
to
sojourn
with
you
how
creeps
acquaintance
his
father
and
i
were
soldiers
together
to
whom
i
have
been
often
bound
for
no
less
than
my
life
here
comes
the
briton
let
him
be
so
entertained
amongst
you
as
suits
with
gentlemen
of
your
knowing
to
a
stranger
of
his
quality
i
beseech
you
all
be
better
known
to
this
gentleman
whom
i
commend
to
you
as
a
noble
friend
of
mine
how
worthy
he
is
i
will
leave
to
appear
hereafter
rather
than
story
him
in
his
own
hearing
sir
we
have
known
together
in
orleans
since
when
i
have
been
debtor
to
you
for
courtesies
which
i
will
be
ever
to
pay
and
yet
pay
still
sir
you
oerrate
my
poor
kindness
i
was
glad
i
did
atone
my
countryman
and
you
it
had
been
pity
you
should
have
been
put
together
with
so
mortal
a
purpose
as
then
each
bore
upon
importance
of
so
slight
and
trivial
a
nature
by
your
pardon
sir
i
was
then
a
young
traveller
rather
shunned
to
go
even
with
what
i
heard
than
in
my
every
action
to
be
guided
by
others
experiences
but
upon
my
mended
judgment
if
i
offend
not
to
say
it
is
mended
my
quarrel
was
not
altogether
slight
faith
yes
to
be
put
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
and
by
such
two
that
would
by
all
likelihood
have
confounded
one
the
other
or
have
fallen
both
can
we
with
manners
ask
what
was
the
difference
safely
i
think
twas
a
contention
in
public
which
may
without
contradiction
suffer
the
report
it
was
much
like
an
argument
that
fell
out
last
night
where
each
of
us
fell
in
praise
of
our
country
mistresses
this
gentleman
at
that
time
vouching
and
upon
warrant
of
bloody
affirmation
his
to
be
more
fair
virtuous
wise
chaste
constant
qualified
and
less
attemptable
than
any
the
rarest
of
our
ladies
in
france
that
lady
is
not
now
living
or
this
gentlemans
opinion
by
this
worn
out
she
holds
her
virtue
still
and
i
my
mind
you
must
not
so
far
prefer
her
fore
ours
of
italy
being
so
far
provoked
as
i
was
in
france
i
would
abate
her
nothing
though
i
profess
myself
her
adorer
not
her
friend
as
fair
and
as
good
a
kind
of
handinhand
comparison
had
been
something
too
fair
and
too
good
for
any
lady
in
britain
if
she
went
before
others
i
have
seen
as
that
diamond
of
yours
outlustres
many
i
have
beheld
i
could
not
but
believe
she
excelled
many
but
i
have
not
seen
the
most
precious
diamond
that
is
nor
you
the
lady
i
praised
her
as
i
rated
her
so
do
i
my
stone
what
do
you
esteem
it
at
more
than
the
world
enjoys
either
your
unparagoned
mistress
is
dead
or
shes
outprized
by
a
trifle
you
are
mistaken
the
one
may
be
sold
or
given
or
if
there
were
wealth
enough
for
the
purchase
or
merit
for
the
gift
the
other
is
not
a
thing
for
sale
and
only
the
gift
of
the
gods
which
the
gods
have
given
you
which
by
their
graces
i
will
keep
you
may
wear
her
in
little
yours
but
you
know
strange
fowl
light
upon
neighbouring
ponds
your
ring
may
be
stolen
too
so
your
brace
of
unprizeable
estimations
the
one
is
but
frail
and
the
other
causal
a
cunning
thief
or
a
that
way
accomplished
courtier
would
hazard
the
winning
both
of
first
and
last
your
italy
contains
none
so
accomplished
a
courtier
to
convince
the
honour
of
my
mistress
if
in
the
holding
or
loss
of
that
you
term
her
frail
i
do
nothing
doubt
you
have
store
of
thieves
notwithstanding
i
fear
not
my
ring
let
us
leave
here
gentlemen
sir
with
all
my
heart
this
worthy
signior
i
thank
him
makes
no
stranger
of
me
we
are
familiar
at
first
with
five
times
so
much
conversation
i
should
get
ground
of
your
fair
mistress
make
her
go
back
even
to
the
yielding
had
i
admittance
and
opportunity
to
friend
no
no
i
dare
thereupon
pawn
the
moiety
of
my
estate
to
your
ring
which
in
my
opinion
oervalues
it
something
but
i
make
my
wager
rather
against
your
confidence
than
her
reputation
and
to
bar
your
offence
herein
too
i
durst
attempt
it
against
any
lady
in
the
world
you
are
a
great
deal
abused
in
too
bold
a
persuasion
and
i
doubt
not
you
sustain
what
youre
worthy
of
by
your
attempt
whats
that
a
repulse
though
your
attempt
as
you
call
it
deserves
more
a
punishment
too
gentlemen
enough
of
this
it
came
in
too
suddenly
let
it
die
as
it
was
born
and
i
pray
you
be
better
acquainted
would
i
had
put
my
estate
and
my
neighbours
on
the
approbation
of
what
i
have
spoke
what
lady
would
you
choose
to
assail
yours
whom
in
constancy
you
think
stands
so
safe
i
will
lay
you
ten
thousand
ducats
to
your
ring
that
commend
me
to
the
court
where
your
lady
is
with
no
more
advantage
than
the
opportunity
of
a
second
conference
and
i
will
bring
from
thence
that
honour
of
hers
which
you
imagine
so
reserved
i
will
wage
against
your
gold
gold
to
it
my
ring
i
hold
dear
as
my
finger
tis
part
of
it
you
are
afraid
and
therein
the
wiser
if
you
buy
ladies
flesh
at
a
million
a
dram
you
cannot
preserve
it
from
tainting
but
i
see
you
have
some
religion
in
you
that
you
fear
this
is
but
a
custom
in
your
tongue
you
bear
a
graver
purpose
i
hope
i
am
the
master
of
my
speeches
and
would
undergo
whats
spoken
i
swear
will
you
i
shall
but
lend
my
diamond
till
your
return
let
there
be
covenants
drawn
between
s
my
mistress
exceeds
in
goodness
the
hugeness
of
your
unworthy
thinking
i
dare
you
to
this
match
heres
my
ring
i
will
have
it
no
lay
by
the
gods
it
is
one
if
i
bring
you
no
sufficient
testimony
that
i
have
enjoyed
the
dearest
bodily
part
of
your
mistress
my
ten
thousand
ducats
are
yours
so
is
your
diamond
too
if
i
come
off
and
leave
her
in
such
honour
as
you
have
trust
in
she
your
jewel
this
your
jewel
and
my
gold
are
yours
provided
i
have
your
commendation
for
my
more
free
entertainment
i
embrace
these
conditions
let
us
have
articles
betwixt
us
only
thus
far
you
shall
answer
if
you
make
your
voyage
upon
her
and
give
me
directly
to
understand
that
you
have
prevailed
i
am
no
further
your
enemy
she
is
not
worth
our
debate
if
she
remain
unseduced
you
not
making
it
appear
otherwise
for
your
ill
opinion
and
the
assault
you
have
made
to
her
chastity
you
shall
answer
me
with
your
sword
your
hand
a
covenant
we
will
have
these
things
set
down
by
lawful
counsel
and
straight
away
for
britain
lest
the
bargain
should
catch
cold
and
starve
i
will
fetch
my
gold
and
have
our
two
wagers
recorded
agreed
will
this
hold
think
you
signior
iachimo
will
not
from
it
pray
let
us
follow
em
whiles
yet
the
dew
s
on
ground
gather
those
flowers
make
haste
who
has
the
note
of
them
i
madam
dispatch
now
master
doctor
have
you
brought
those
drugs
pleaseth
your
highness
ay
here
they
are
madam
but
i
beseech
your
grace
without
offence
my
conscience
bids
me
ask
wherefore
you
have
commanded
of
me
these
most
poisonous
compounds
which
are
the
movers
of
a
languishing
death
but
though
slow
deadly
i
wonder
doctor
thou
askst
me
such
a
question
have
i
not
been
thy
pupil
long
hast
thou
not
learnd
me
how
to
make
perfumes
distil
preserve
yea
so
that
our
great
king
himself
doth
woo
me
oft
for
my
confections
having
thus
far
proceeded
unless
thou
thinkst
me
devilish
is
t
not
meet
that
i
did
amplify
my
judgment
in
other
conclusions
i
will
try
the
forces
of
these
thy
compounds
on
such
creatures
as
we
count
not
worth
the
hanging
but
none
human
to
try
the
vigour
of
them
and
apply
allayments
to
their
act
and
by
them
gather
their
several
virtues
and
effects
your
highness
shall
from
this
practice
but
make
hard
your
heart
besides
the
seeing
these
effects
will
be
both
noisome
and
infectious
o
content
thee
here
comes
a
flattering
rascal
upon
him
will
i
first
work
hes
for
his
master
and
enemy
to
my
son
how
now
pisanio
doctor
your
service
for
this
time
is
ended
take
your
own
way
i
do
suspect
you
madam
but
you
shall
do
no
harm
hark
thee
a
word
i
do
not
like
her
she
doth
think
she
has
strange
lingering
poisons
i
do
know
her
spirit
and
will
not
trust
one
of
her
malice
with
a
drug
of
such
damnd
nature
those
she
has
will
stupify
and
dull
the
sense
awhile
which
first
perchance
shell
prove
on
cats
and
dogs
then
afterward
up
higher
but
there
is
no
danger
in
what
show
of
death
it
makes
more
than
the
lockingup
the
spirits
a
time
to
be
more
fresh
reviving
she
is
foold
with
a
most
false
effect
and
i
the
truer
so
to
be
false
with
her
no
further
service
doctor
until
i
send
for
thee
i
humbly
take
my
leave
weeps
she
still
sayst
thou
dost
thou
think
in
time
she
will
not
quench
and
let
instructions
enter
where
folly
now
possesses
do
thou
work
when
thou
shalt
bring
me
word
she
loves
my
son
ill
tell
thee
on
the
instant
thou
art
then
as
great
as
is
thy
master
greater
for
his
fortunes
all
lie
speechless
and
his
name
is
at
last
gasp
return
he
cannot
nor
continue
where
he
is
to
shift
his
being
is
to
exchange
one
misery
with
another
and
every
day
that
comes
comes
to
decay
a
days
work
in
him
what
shalt
thou
expect
to
be
depender
on
a
thing
that
leans
who
cannot
be
new
built
nor
has
no
friends
so
much
as
but
to
prop
him
thou
takst
up
thou
knowst
not
what
but
take
it
for
thy
labour
it
is
a
thing
i
made
which
hath
the
king
five
times
redeemd
from
death
i
do
not
know
what
is
more
cordial
nay
i
prithee
take
it
it
is
an
earnest
of
a
further
good
that
i
mean
to
thee
tell
thy
mistress
how
the
case
stands
with
her
do
t
as
from
thyself
think
what
a
chance
thou
changest
on
but
think
thou
hast
thy
mistress
still
to
boot
my
son
who
shall
take
notice
of
thee
ill
move
the
king
to
any
shape
of
thy
preferment
such
as
thoult
desire
and
then
myself
i
chiefly
that
set
thee
on
to
this
desert
am
bound
to
load
thy
merit
richly
call
my
women
think
on
my
words
a
sly
and
constant
knave
not
to
be
shakd
the
agent
for
his
master
and
the
remembrancer
of
her
to
hold
the
handfast
to
her
lord

have
given
him
that
which
if
he
take

quite
unpeople
her
of
leigers
for
her
sweet
and
which
she
after
except
she

and
i
have
lost
the
wager

to
foot
or
like
the
parthian

flying
fight
rather
directly
fly
he
is
one
of
the
noblest
note
to
whose
kindnesses
i

thanks
fairest

what
are
men
mad
hath
nature
given
them
eyes
to
see
this
vaulted
arch
and
the
rich
crop
of
sea
and
land
which
can
distinguish
twixt
the
fiery
orbs
above
and
the
twinnd
stones
upon
the
numberd
beach
and
can
we
not
partition
make
with
spectacles
so
precious
twixt
fair
and
foul
what
makes
your
admiration
it
cannot
be
i
the
eye
for
apes
and
monkeys
twixt
two
such
shes
would
chatter
this
way
and
contemn
with
mows
the
other
nor
i
the
judgment
for
idiots
in
this
case
of
favour
would
be
wisely
definite
nor
i
the
appetite
sluttery
to
such
neat
excellence
opposd
should
make
desire
vomit
emptiness
not
so
allurd
to
feed
what
is
the
matter
trow
the
cloyed
will
that
satiate
yet
unsatisfied
desire
that
tub
both
filld
and
running
ravening
first
the
lamb
longs
after
for
the
garbage
what
dear
sir
thus
raps
you
are
you
well
thanks
madam
well
beseech
you
sir
desire
my
mans
abode
where
i
did
leave
him
hes
strange
and
peevish
i
was
going
sir
to
give
him
welcome
continues
well
my
lord
his
health
beseech
you
well
madam
is
he
disposd
to
mirth
i
hope
he
is
exceeding
pleasant
none
a
stranger
there
so
merry
and
so
gamesome
he
is
calld
the
briton
reveller
when
he
was
here
he
did
incline
to
sadness
and
ofttimes
not
knowing
why
i
never
saw
him
sad
there
is
a
frenchman
his
companion
one
an
eminent
monsieur
that
it
seems
much
loves
a
gallian
girl
at
home
he
furnaces
the
thick
sighs
from
him
whiles
the
jolly
briton
your
lord
i
mean
laughs
from
s
free
lungs
cries
o
can
my
sides
hold
to
think
that
man
who
knows
by
history
report
or
his
own
proof
what
woman
is
yea
what
she
cannot
choose
but
must
be
will
his
free
hours
languish
for
assured
bondage
will
my
lord
say
so
ay
madam
with
his
eyes
in
flood
with
laughter
it
is
a
recreation
to
be
by
and
hear
him
mock
the
frenchman
but
heavens
know
some
men
are
much
to
blame
not
he
i
hope
not
he
but
yet
heavens
bounty
towards
him
might
be
usd
more
thankfully
in
himself
tis
much
in
you
which
i
account
his
beyond
all
talents
whilst
i
am
bound
to
wonder
i
am
bound
to
pity
too
what
do
you
pity
sir
two
creatures
heartily
am
i
one
sir
you
look
on
me
what
wrack
discern
you
in
me
deserves
your
pity
lamentable
what
to
hide
me
from
the
radiant
sun
and
solace
i
the
dungeon
by
a
snuff
i
pray
you
sir
deliver
with
more
openness
your
answers
to
my
demands
why
do
you
pity
me
that
others
do
i
was
about
to
say
enjoy
your
but
it
is
an
office
of
the
gods
to
venge
it
not
mine
to
speak
on
t
you
do
seem
to
know
something
of
me
or
what
concerns
me
pray
you
since
doubting
things
go
ill
often
hurts
more
than
to
be
sure
they
do
for
certainties
either
are
past
remedies
or
timely
knowing
the
remedy
then
born
discover
to
me
what
both
you
spur
and
stop
had
i
this
cheek
to
bathe
my
lips
upon
this
hand
whose
touch
whose
every
touch
would
force
the
feelers
soul
to
the
oath
of
loyalty
this
object
which
takes
prisoner
the
wild
motion
of
mine
eye
firing
it
only
here
should
i
damnd
then
slaver
with
lips
as
common
as
the
stairs
that
mount
the
capitol
join
gripes
with
hands
made
hard
with
hourly
falsehood
falsehood
as
with
labour
then
bypeeping
in
an
eye
base
and
illustrous
as
the
smoky
light
thats
fed
with
stinking
tallow
it
were
fit
that
all
the
plagues
of
hell
should
at
one
time
encounter
such
revolt
my
lord
i
fear
has
forgot
britain
and
himself
not
i
inclind
to
this
intelligence
pronounce
the
beggary
of
his
change
but
tis
your
graces
that
from
my
mutest
conscience
to
my
tongue
charms
this
report
out
let
me
hear
no
more
o
dearest
soul
your
cause
doth
strike
my
heart
with
pity
that
doth
make
me
sick
a
lady
so
fair
and

to
an
empery

make
the
greatst
king
double
to
be
partnerd
with
tomboys
hird
with
that
selfexhibition
which
your

such
a
heart
that

abuse
if

wrongst
a
gentleman
who
is
as
far
from
thy
report
as

from

and
solicitst
here
a
lady
that
disdains
thee
and
the
devil
alike
what
ho
pisanio
the
king
my
father
shall
be
made
acquainted
of
thy
assault
if

shall
think
it
fit
a
saucy
stranger
in
his
court
to
mart
as
in
a
romish
stew
and
to
expound
his
beastly
mind
to
us
he
hath
a
court

little
cares
for
and
a
daughter
who
he
not
respects
at
all
what
ho
pisanio
o
happy
leonatus
i
may
say
the
credit
that
thy

perfect
goodness
her
assurd
credit
blessed

societies
into
him
half
all
mens
hearts
are
his

a
kind
of
honour

off
more
than
a
mortal
seeming

most
mighty
princess

adventurd
to
try
your
taking
of

midnight
madam
i
have
read
three
hours
then
mine
eyes
are
weak
fold
down
the
leaf
where
i
have
left
to
bed
take
not
away
the
taper
leave
it
burning
and
if
thou
canst
awake
by
four
o
the
clock
i
prithee
call
me
sleep
has
seized
me
wholly
to
your
protection
i
commend
me
gods
from
fairies
and
the
tempters
of
the
night
guard
me
beseech
ye
the
crickets
sing
and
mans
oerlabourd
sense
repairs
itself
by
rest
our
tarquin
thus
did
softly
press
the
rushes
ere
he
wakend
the
chastity
he
wounded
cytherea
how
bravely
thou
becomst
thy
bed
freshlily
and
whiter
than
the
sheets
that
i
might
touch
but
kiss
one
kiss
rubies
unparagond
how
dearly
they
do
t
tis
her
breathing
that
perfumes
the
chamber
thus
the
flame
of
the
taper
bows
toward
her
and
would
underpeep
her
lids
to
see
the
enclosed
lights
now
canopied
under
these
windows
white
and
azure
lacd
with
blue
of
heavens
own
tinct
but
my
design
to
note
the
chamber
i
will
write
all
down
such
and
such
pictures
there
the
window
such
th
adornment
of
her
bed
the
arras
figures
why
such
and
such
and
the
contents
o
the
story
ah
but
some
natural
notes
about
her
body
above
ten
thousand
meaner
moveables
would
testify
to
enrich
mine
inventory
o
sleep
thou
ape
of
death
lie
dull
upon
her
and
be
her
senses
but
as
a
monument
thus
in
a
chapel
lying
come
off
come
off
as
slippery
as
the
gordian
knot
was
hard
tis
mine
and
this
will
witness
outwardly
as
strongly
as
the
conscience
does
within
to
the
madding
of
her
lord
on
her
left
breast
a
mole
cinquespotted
like
the
crimson
drops
i
the
bottom
of
a
cowslip
heres
a
voucher
stronger
than
ever
law
could
make
this
secret
will
force
him
think
i
have
pickd
the
lock
and
taen
the
treasure
of
her
honour
no
more
to
what
end
why
should
i
write
this
down
thats
riveted
screwd
to
my
memory
she
hath
been
reading
late
the
tale
of
tereus
here
the
leafs
turnd
down
where
philomel
gave
up
i
have
enough
to
the
trunk
again
and
shut
the
spring
of
it
swift
swift
you
dragons
of
the
night
that
dawning
may
bare
the
ravens
eye
i
lodge
in
fear
though
this
a
heavenly
angel
hell
is
here
one
two
three
time
time
your
lordship
is
the
most
patient
man
in
loss
the
most
coldest
that
ever
turned
up
ace
it
would
make
any
man
cold
to
lose
but
not
every
man
patient
after
the
noble
temper
of
your
lordship
you
are
most
hot
and
furious
when
you
win
winning
will
put
any
man
into
courage
if
i
could
get
this
foolish
imogen
i
should
have
gold
enough
its
almost
morning
is
t
not
day
my
lord
i
would
this
music
would
come
i
am
advised
to
give
her
music
o
mornings
they
say
it
will
penetrate
come
on
tune
if
you
can
penetrate
her
with
your
fingering
so
well
try
with
tongue
too
if
none
will
do
let
her
remain
but
ill
never
give
oer
first
a
very
excellent
goodconceited
thing
after
a
wonderful
sweet
air
with
admirable
rich
words
to
it
and
then
let
her
consider
hark
hark
the
lark

much
sorry
sir
you

to
forget
a
ladys
manners
by
being
so
verbal
and
learn
now
for
all
that
i
which
know
my
heart
do
here
pronounce
by
the
very
truth
of
it
i
care
not
for
you
and
am
so
near
the
lack
of
charity
to
accuse
myself
i
hate
you
which
i
had
rather
you
felt
than
make
t
my
boast
you
sin
against
obedience
which
you
owe
your
father
for
the
contract
you
pretend
with
that
base
wretch
one
bred
of
alms
and
fosterd
with
cold
dishes
with
scraps
o
the
court
it
is
no
contract
none
and
though
it
be
allowd
in
meaner
parties
yet
who
than
he
more
mean
to
knit
their
souls
on
whom
there
is
no
more
dependancy
but
brats
and
beggary
in
selffigurd
knot
yet
you
are
curbd
from
that
enlargement
by
the
consequence
o
the
crown
and
must
not
soil
the
precious
note
of
it
with
a
base
slave
a
hilding
for
a
livery
a
squires
cloth
a
pantler
not
so
eminent
profane
fellow
wert
thou
the
son
of
jupiter
and
no
more
but
what
thou
art
besides
thou
wert
too
base
to
be
his
groom
thou
wert
dignified
enough
even
to
the
point
of
envy
if
twere
made
comparative
for
your
virtues
to
be
styld
the
underhangman
of
his
kingdom
and
hated
for
being
preferrd
so
well
the
southfog
rot
him
he
never
can
meet
more
mischance
than
come
to
be
but
namd
of
thee
his
meanest
garment
that
ever
hath
but
clippd
his
body
is
dearer
in
my
respect
than

men

this
morning
confident
i
am
last
night
twas
on
mine
arm

kissd
it
i
hope
it
be
not

to
tell
my
lord

abusd

i
will
inform

the
worst
of

the
worst
of
discontent

were
so
sure
to
win
the
king
as
i
am
bold
her
honour
will
remain
hers
what
means
do
you
make
to
him
not
any
but
abide
the
change
of
time
quake
in
the
present
winters
state
and
wish
that
warmer
days
would
come
in
these
seard
hopes
i
barely
gratify
your
love
they
failing
i
must
die
much
your
debtor
your
very
goodness
and
your
company
oerpays
all
i
can
do
by
this
your
king
hath
heard
of
great
augustus
caius
lucius
will
do
s
commission
throughly
and
i
think
hell
grant
the
tribute
send
the
arrearages
or
look
upon
our
romans
whose
remembrance
is
yet
fresh
in
their
grief
i
do
believe
statist
though
i
am
none
nor
like
to
be
that
this
will
prove
a
war
and
you
shall
hear
the
legions
now
in
gallia
sooner
landed
in
our
notfearing
britain
than
have
tidings
of
any
penny
tribute
paid
our
countrymen
are
men
more
orderd
than
when
julius
c
sar
smild
at
their
lack
of
skill
but
found
their
courage
worthy
his
frowning
at
their
discipline
now
winged
with
their
courage
will
make
known
to
their
approvers
they
are
people
such
that
mend
upon
the
world
see
iachimo
the
swiftest
harts
have
posted
you
by
land
and
winds
of
all
the
corners
kissd
your
sails
to
make
your
vessel
nimble
welcome
sir
i
hope
the
briefness
of
your
answer
made
the
speediness
of
your
return
your
lady
is
one
of
the
fairest
that
i
have
lookd
upon
and
therewithal
the
best
or
let
her
beauty
look
through
a
casement
to
allure
false
hearts
and
be
false
with
them
here
are
letters
for
you
their
tenour
good
i
trust
tis
very
like
was
caius
lucius
in
the
britain
court
when
you
were
there
he
was
expected
then
but
not
approachd
all
is
well
yet
sparkles
this
stone
as
it
was
wont
or
ist
not
too
dull
for
your
good
wearing
if
i
have
lost
it
i
should
have
lost
the
worth
of
it
in
gold
ill
make
a
journey
twice
as
far
to
enjoy
a
second
night
of
such
sweet
shortness
which
was
mine
in
britain
for
the
ring
is
won
the
stones
too
hard
to
come
by
not
a
whit
your
lady
being
so
easy
make
not
sir
your
loss
your
sport
i
hope
you
know
that
we
must
not
continue
friends
good
sir
we
must
if
you
keep
covenant
had
i
not
brought
the
knowledge
of
your
mistress
home
i
grant
we
were
to
question
further
but
i
now
profess
myself
the
winner
of
her
honour
together
with
your
ring
and
not
the
wronger
of
her
or
you
having
proceeded
but
by
both
your
wills
if
you
can
make
t
apparent
that
you
have
tasted
her
in
bed
my
hand
and
ring
is
yours
if
not
the
foul
opinion
you
had
of
her
pure
honour
gains
or
loses
your
sword
or
mine
or
masterless
leaves
both
to
who
shall
find
them
sir
my
circumstances
being
so
near
the
truth
as
i
will
make
them
must
first
induce
you
to
believe
whose
strength
i
will
confirm
with
oath
which
i
doubt
not
youll
give
me
leave
to
spare
when
you
shall
find
you
need
it
not
proceed
first
her
bedchamber
where
i
confess
i
slept
not
but
profess
had
that
was
well
worth
watching
it
was
hangd
with
tapestry
of
silk
and
silver
the
story
proud
cleopatra
when
she
met
her
roman
and
cydnus
swelld
above
the
banks
or
for
the
press
of
boats
or
pride
a
piece
of
work
so
bravely
done
so
rich
that
it
did
strive
in
workmanship
and
value
which
i
wonderd
could
be
rarely
and
exactly
wrought
since
the
true
life
on
t
was
this
is
true
and
this
you
might
have
heard
of
here
by
me
or
by
some
other
more
particulars
must
justify
my
knowledge
so
they
must
or
do
your
honour
injury
the
chimney
is
south
the
chamber
and
the
chimneypiece
chaste
dian
bathing
never
saw
i
figures
so
likely
to
report
themselves
the
cutter
was
as
another
nature
dumb
outwent
her
motion
and
breath
left
out
this
is
a
thing
which
you
might
from
relation
likewise
reap
being
as
it
is
much
spoke
of
the
roof
o
the
chamber
with
golden
cherubins
is
fretted
her
andirons
i
had
forgot
them
were
two
winking
cupids
of
silver
each
on
one
foot
standing
nicely
depending
on
their
brands
this
is
her
honour
let
it
be
granted
you
have
seen
all
this
and
praise
be
given
to
your
remembrance
the
description
of
what
is
in
her
chamber
nothing
saves
the
wager
you
have
laid
then
if
you
can
be
pale
i
beg
but
leave
to
air
this
jewel
see
and
now
tis
up
again
it
must
be
married
to
that
your
diamond
ill
keep
them
jove
once
more
let
me
behold
it
is
it
that
which
i
left
with
her
sir
i
thank
her
that
she
strippd
it
from
her
arm
i
see
her
yet
her
pretty
action
did
outsell
her
gift
and
yet
enrichd
it
too
she
gave
it
me
and
said
she
prizd
it
once
may
be
she
pluckd
it
off
to
send
it
me
she
writes
so
to
you
doth
she
o
no
no
no
tis
true
here
take
this
too
it
is
a
basilisk
unto
mine
eye
kills
me
to
look
on
t
let
there
be
no
honour
where
there
is
beauty
truth
where
semblance
love
where
theres
another
man
the
vows
of
women
of
no
more
bondage
be
to
where
they
are
made
than
they
are
to
their
virtues
which
is
nothing
o
above
measure
false
have
patience
sir
and
take
your
ring
again
tis
not
yet
won
it
may
be
probable
she
lost
it
or
who
knows
if
one
of
her
women
being
corrupted
hath
stoln
it
from
her
very
true
and
so
i
hope
he
came
by
t
back
my
ring
render
to
me
some
corporal
sign
about
her
more
evident
than
this
for
this
was
stoln
by
jupiter
i
had
it
from
her
arm
hark
you
he
swears
by
jupiter
he
swears
tis
true
nay
keep
the
ring
tis
true
i
am
sure
she
would
not
lose
it
her
attendants
are
all
sworn
and
honourable
they
inducd
to
steal
it
and
by
a
stranger
no
he
hath
enjoyd
her
the
cognizance
of
her
incontinency
is
this
she
hath
bought
the
name
of
whore
thus
dearly
there
take
thy
hire
and
all
the
fiends
of
hell
divide
themselves
between
you
sir
be
patient
this
is
not
strong
enough
to
be
believd
of
one
persuaded
well
of
never
talk
on
t
she
hath
been
colted
by
him
if
you
seek
for
further
satisfying
under
her
breast
worthy
the
pressing
lies
a
mole
right
proud
of
that
most
delicate
lodging
by
my
life
i
kissd
it
and
it
gave
me
present
hunger
to
feed
again
though
full
you
do
remember
this
stain
upon
her
ay
and
it
doth
confirm
another
stain
as
big
as
hell
can
hold
were
there
no
more
but
it
will
you
hear
more
spare
your
arithmetic
never
count
the
turns
once
and
a
million
ill
be
sworn
no
swearing
if
you
will
swear
you
have
not
done
t
you
lie
and
i
will
kill
thee
if
thou
dost
deny
thoust
made
me
cuckold
ill
deny
nothing
o
that
i
had
her
here
to
tear
her
limbmeal
i
will
go
there
and
do
t
i
the
court
before
her
father
ill
do
something
quite
besides
the
government
of
patience
you
have
won
lets
follow
him
and
pervert
the
present
wrath
he
hath
against
himself
with
all
my
heart
is
there
no
way
for
men
to
be
but
women
must
be
halfworkers
we
are
all
bastards
all
and
that
most
venerable
man
which
i
did
call
my
father
was
i
know
not
where
when
i
was
stampd
some
coiner
with
his
tools
made
me
a
counterfeit
yet
my
mother
seemd
the
dian
of
that
time
so
doth
my
wife
the
nonpareil
of
this
o
vengeance
vengeance
me
of
my
lawful
pleasure
she
restraind
and
prayd
me
oft
forbearance
did
it
with
a
pudency
so
rosy
the
sweet
view
on
t
might
well
have
warmd
old
saturn
that
i
thought
her
as
chaste
as
unsunnd
snow
o
all
the
devils
this
yellow
iachimo
in
an
hour
was
t
not
or
less
at
first
perchance
he
spoke
not
but
like
a
fullacornd
boar
a
german
one
cried
o
and
mounted
found
no
opposition
but
what
he
lookd
for
should
oppose
and
she
should
from
encounter
guard
could
i
find
out
the
womans
part
in
me
for
theres
no
motion
that
tends
to
vice
in
man
but
i
affirm
it
is
the
womans
part
be
it
lying
note
it
the
womans
flattering
hers
deceiving
hers
lust
and
rank
thoughts
hers
hers
revenges
hers
ambitions
covetings
change
of
prides
disdain
nice
longing
slanders
mutability
all
faults
that
man
may
name
nay
that
hell
knows
why
hers
in
part
or
all
but
rather
all
for
even
to
vice
they
are
not
constant
but
are
changing
still
one
vice
but
of
a
minute
old
for
one
not
half
so
old
as
that
ill
write
against
them
detest
them
curse
them
yet
tis
greater
skill
in
a
true
hate
to
pray
they
have
their

augustus
c
sar
with
us
when
julius
c
sar
whose
remembrance
yet
lives
in
mens
eyes
and
will
to
ears
and
tongues
be
theme
and
hearing
ever
was
in
this
britain
and
conquerd
it
cassibelan
thine
uncle
famous
in
c
sars
praises
no
whit
less
than
in
his
feats
deserving
it
for
him
and
his
succession
granted
rome
a
tribute
yearly
three
thousand
pounds
which
by
thee
lately
is
left
untenderd
and
to
kill
the
marvel
shall
be
so
ever
there
be
many
c
sars
ere
such
another
julius
britain
is
a
world
by
itself
and
we
will
nothing
pay
for
wearing
our
own
noses
that
opportunity
which
then
they
had
to
take
from
s
to
resume
we
have
again
remember
sir
my
liege
the
kings
your
ancestors
together
with
the
natural
bravery
of
your
isle
which
stands
as
neptunes
park
ribbed
and
paled
in
with
rocks
unscaleable
and
roaring
waters
with
sands
that
will
not
bear
your
enemies
boats
but
suck
them
up
to
the
topmast
a
kind
of
conquest
c
sar
made
here
but
made
not
here
his
brag
of
came
and
saw
and
overcame
with
shame
the
first
that
ever
touchd
him
he
was
carried
from
off
our
coast
twice
beaten
and
his
shipping
poor
ignorant
baubles
on
our
terrible
seas
like
eggshells
movd
upon
their
surges
crackd
as
easily
gainst
our
rocks
for
joy
whereof
the
famd
cassibelan
who
was
once
at
point
o
giglot
fortune
to
master
c
sars
sword
made
luds
town
with
rejoicingfires
bright
and
britons
stiut
with
courage
come
theres
no
more
tribute
to
be
paid
our
kingdom
is
stronger
than
it
was
at
that
time
and
as
i
said
there
is
no
moe
such
c
sars
other
of
them
may
have
crooked
noses
but
to
owe
such
straight
arms
none
son
let
your
mother
end
we
have
yet
many
among
us
can
gripe
as
hard
as
cassibelan
i
do
not
say
i
am
one
but
i
have
a
hand
why
tribute
why
should
we
pay
tribute
if
c
sar
can
hide
the
sun
from
us
with
a
blanket
or
put
the
moon
in
his
pocket
we
will
pay
him
tribute
for
light
else
sir
no
more
tribute
pray
you
now
you
must
know
till
the
injurious
romans
did
extort
this
tribute
from
us
we
were
free
c
sars
ambition
which
swelld
so
much
that
it
did
almost
stretch
the
sides
o
the
world
against
all
colour
here
did
put
the
yoke
upon
s
which
to
shake
off
becomes
a
warlike
people
whom
we
reckon
ourselves
to
be
we
do
say
then
to
c
sar
our
ancestor
was
that
mulmutius
which
ordaind
our
laws
whose
use
the
sword
of
c
sar
hath
too
much
mangled
whose
repair
and
franchise
shall
by
the
power
we
hold
be
our
good
deed
though
rome
be
therefore
angry
mulmutius
made
our
laws
who
was
the
first
of
britain
which
did
put
his
brows
within
a
golden
crown
and
calld
himself
a
king
i
am
sorry
cymbeline
that
i
am
to
pronounce
augustus

by
the

tell
me
how
wales
was
made
so
happy
as

first
of

how

for

gap
that

slow
i
have
heard
of

have
been
nimbler
than
the

but
this
is
foolery
go
bid
my

feign
a
sickness
say
shell
home
to
her

and
provide
me
presently
a
ridingsuit
no
costlier

madam
youre
best
consider
i
see
before

man
nor

but
have
a
fog
in

that
i
cannot
look

i
prithee
do
as
i
bid
thee
theres
no
more
to
say
accessible
is
none
but
milford
way
a
goodly
day
not
to
keep
house
with
such
whose
roofs
as
low
as
ours
stoop
boys
this
gate
instructs
you
how
to
adore
the
heavens
and
bows
you
to
a
mornings
holy
office
the
gates
of
monarchs
are
archd
so
high
that
giants
may
jet
through
and
keep
their
impious
turbans
on
without
good
morrow
to
the

hail
thou
fair
heaven
we
house
i
the
rock
yet
use
thee
not
so
hardly
as
prouder
livers
do
hail
heaven
hail
heaven
now
for
our
mountain
sport
up
to
yond
hill
your
legs
are
young
ill
tread
these
flats
consider
when
you
above
perceive
me
like
a
crow
that
it
is
place
which
lessens
and
sets
off
and
you
may
then
revolve
what
tales
i
have
told
you
of
courts
of
princes
of
the
tricks
in
war
this
service
is
not
service
so
being
done
but
being
so
allowd
to
apprehend
thus
draws
us
a
profit
from
all
things
we
see
and
often
to
our
comfort
shall
we
find
the
sharded
beetle
in
a
safer
hold
than
is
the
full
wingd
eagle
o
this
life
is
nobler
than
attending
for
a
check
richer
than
doing
nothing
for
a
bribe
prouder
than
rustling
in
unpaidfor
silk
such
gain
the
cap
of
him
that
makes
em
fine
yet
keeps
his
book
uncrossd
no
life
to
ours
out
of
your
proof
you
speak
we
poor
unfledgd
have
never
wingd
from
view
o
the
nest
nor
know
not
what
airs
from
home
haply
this
life
is
best
if
quiet
life
be
best
sweeter
to
you
that
have
a
sharper
known
well
corresponding
with
your
stiff
age
but
unto
us
it
is
a
cell
of
ignorance
travelling
abed
a
prison
for
a
debtor
that
not
dares
to
stride
a
limit
what
should
we
speak
of
when
we
are
old
as
you
when
we
shall
hear
the
rain
and
wind
beat
dark
december
how
in
this
our
pinching
cave
shall
we
discourse
the
freezing
hours
away
we
have
seen
nothing
we
are
beastly
subtle
as
the
fox
for
prey
like
warlike
as
the
wolf
for
what
we
eat
our
valour
is
to
chase
what
flies
our
cage
we
make
a
quire
as
doth
the
prisond
bird
and
sing
our
bondage
freely
how
you
speak
did
you
but
know
the
citys
usuries
and
felt
them
knowingly
the
art
o
the
court
as
hard
to
leave
as
keep
whose
top
to
climb
is
certain
falling
or
so
slippery
that
the
fears
as
bad
as
falling
the
toil
of
the
war
a
pain
that
only
seems
to
seek
out
danger
i
the
name
of
fame
and
honour
which
dies
i
the
search
and
hath
as
oft
a
slanderous
epitaph
as
record
of
fair
act
nay
many
times
doth
ill
deserve
by
doing
well
whats
worse
must
curtsy
at
the
censure
o
boys
this
story
the
world
may
read
in
me
my
bodys
markd
with
roman
swords
and
my
report
was
once
first
with
the
best
of
note
cymbeline
lovd
me
and
when
a
soldier
was
the
theme
my
name
was
not
far
off
then
was
i
as
a
tree
whose
boughs
did
bend
with
fruit
but
in
one
night
a
storm
or
robbery
call
it
what
you
will
shook
down
my
mellow
hangings
nay
my
leaves
and
left
me
bare
to
weather
uncertain
favour
my
fault
being
nothing
as
i
have
told
you
oft
but
that
two
villains
whose
false
oaths
prevaild
before
my
perfect
honour
swore
to
cymbeline
i
was
confederate
with
the
romans
so
followd
my
banishment
and
this
twenty
years
this
rock
and
these
demesnes
have
been
my
world
where
i
have
livd
at
honest
freedom
paid
more
pious
debts
to
heaven
than
in
all
the
foreend
of
my
time
but
up
to
the
mountains
this
is
not
hunters
language
he
that
strikes
the
venison
first
shall
be
the
lord
o
the
feast
to
him
the
other
two
shall
minister
and
we
will
fear
no
poison
which
attends
in
place
of
greater
state
ill
meet
you
in
the
valleys
how
hard
it
is
to
hide
the
sparks
of
nature
these
boys
know
little
they
are
sons
to
the
king
nor
cymbeline
dreams
that
they
are
alive
they
think
they
are
mine
and
though
traind
up
thus
meanly
i
the
cave
wherein
they
bow
their
thoughts
do
hit
the
roofs
of
palaces
and
nature
prompts
them
in
simple
and
low
things
to
prince
it
much
beyond
the
trick
of
others
this
polydore
the
heir
of
cymbeline
and
britain
who
the
king
his
father
calld
guiderius
jove
when
on
my
threefoot
stool
i
sit
and
tell
the
warlike
feats
i
have
done
his
spirits
fly
out
into
my
story

thus
mine
enemy
fell
and
thus
i
set
my
foot
on
s
neck
even
then
the
princely
blood
flows
in
his
cheek
he
sweats
strains
his
young
nerves
and
puts
himself
in
posture
that
acts
my
words
the
younger
brother
cadwal
once
arviragus
in
as
like
a
figure
strikes
life
into
my
speech
and
shows
much
more
his
own
conceiving
hark
the
game
is
rousd
o
cymbeline
heaven
and
my
conscience
knows
thou
didst
unjustly
banish
me
whereon
at
three
and
two
years
old

stole
these
babes
thinking
to

of
thee

the
testimonies
whereof
lie
bleeding
in

i
speak
not
out
of
weak
surmises
but
from
proof
as
strong
as
my
grief
and
as
certain
as
i
expect
my
revenge
that

disloyal
what

a
fearful
dream

thats

to

is
it
alas
good
lady
i
false
thy
conscience

iachimo
thou
didst
accuse
him
of
incontinency
thou
then
lookdst
like
a
villain
now
methinks
thy
favours
good
enough
some
jay
of
italy
whose
mother
was
her
painting
hath
betrayd
him
poor
i
am
stale
a
garment
out
of
fashion
and
for
i
am
richer
than
to
hang
by
the
walls
i
must
be
rippd
to
pieces
with
me
o
mens
vows
are
womens
traitors
all
good
seeming
by
thy
revolt
o
husband
shall
be
thought
put
on
for
villany
not
born
where
t
grows
but
worn
a
bait
for
ladies
good
madam
hear
me
true
honest
men
being
heard
like
false
neas
were
in
his
time
thought
false
and
sinons
weeping
did
scandal
many
a
holy
tear
took
pity
from
most
true
wretchedness
so
thou
posthumus
wilt
lay
the
leaven
on
all
proper
men
goodly
and
gallant
shall
be
false
and
perjurd
from
thy
great
fail
come
fellow
be
thou
honest
do
thou
thy
masters
bidding
when
thou
seest
him
a
little
witness
my
obedience
look
i
draw
the
sword
myself
take
it
and
hit
the
innocent
mansion
of
my
love
my
heart
fear
not
tis
empty
of
all
things
but
grief
thy
master
is
not
there
who
was
indeed
the
riches
of
it
do
his
bidding
strike
thou
mayst
be
valiant
in
a
better
cause
but
now
thou
seemst
a
coward
hence
vile
instrument
thou
shalt
not
damn
my
hand
why
i
must
die
and
if
i
do
not
by
thy
hand
thou
art
no
servant
of
thy
masters
against
selfslaughter
there
is
a
prohibition
so
divine
that
cravens
my
weak
hand
come
heres
my
heart
somethings
afore
t
soft
soft
well
no
defence
obedient
as
the
scabbard
what
is
here
the
scriptures
of
the
loyal
leonatus
all
turnd
to
heresy
away
away
corrupters
of
my
faith
you
shall
no
more
be
stomachers
to
my
heart
thus
may
poor
fools
believe
false
teachers
though
those
that
are
betrayd
do
feel
the
treason
sharply
yet
the
traitor
stands
in
worse
case
of
woe
and
thou
posthumus
thou
that
didst
set
up
my
disobedience
gainst
the
king
my
father
and
make
me
put
into
contempt
the
suits
of
princely
fellows
shalt
hereafter
find
it
is
no
act
of
common
passage
but
a
strain
of
rareness
and
i
grieve
myself
to
think
when
thou
shalt
be
disedgd
by
her
that
now
thou
tirst
on
how
thy
memory
will
then
be
pangd
by
me
prithee
dispatch
the
lamb
entreats
the
butcher
wheres
thy
knife
thou
art
too
slow
to
do
thy
masters
bidding
when
i
desire
it
too
o
gracious
lady
since
i
receivd
command
to
do
this
business
i
have
not
slept
one
wink
do
t
and
to
bed
then
ill
wake
mine
eyeballs
blind
first
wherefore
then
didst
undertake
it
why
hast
thou
abusd
so
many
miles
with
a
pretence
this
place
mine
action
and
thine
own
our
horses
labour
the
time
inviting
thee
the
perturbd
court
for
my
being
absent
whereunto
i
never
purpose
return
why
hast
thou
gone
so
far
to
be
unbent
when
thou
hast
taen
thy
stand
the
elected
deer
before
thee
but
to
win
time
to
lose
so
bad
employment
in
the
which
i
have
considerd
of
a
course
good
lady
hear
me
with
patience
talk
thy
tongue
weary
speak
i
have
heard
i
am
a
strumpet
and
mine
ear
therein
false
struck
can
take
no
greater
wound
nor
tent
to
bottom
that
but
speak
then
madam
i
thought
you
would
not
back
again
most
like
bringing
me
here
to
kill
me
not
so
neither
but
if
i
were
as
wise
as
honest
then
my
purpose
would
prove
well
it
cannot
be
but
that
my
master
is
abusd
some
villain
some
villain
ay
and
singular
in
his
art
hath
done
you
both
this
cursed
injury
some
roman
courtezan
no
on
my
life
ill
give
but
notice
you
are
dead
and
send
him
some
bloody
sign
of
it
for
tis
commanded
i
should
do
so
you
shall
be
missd
at
court
and
that
will
well
confirm
it
why
good
fellow
what
shall
i
do
the
while
where
bide
how
live
or
in
my
life
what
comfort
when
i
am
dead
to
my
husband
if
youll
back
to
the
court
no
court
no
father
nor
no
more
ado
with
that
harsh
noble
simple
nothing
cloten
that
cloten
whose
lovesuit
hath
been
to
me
as
fearful
as
a
siege
if
not
at
court
then
not
in
britain
must
you
bide
where
then
hath
britain
all
the
sun
that
shines
day
night
are
they
not
but
in
britain
i
the
worlds
volume
our
britain
seems
as
of
it
but
not
in
t
in
a
great
pool
a
swans
nest
prithee
think
theres
livers
out
of
britain
i
am
most
glad
you
think
of
other
place
the
ambassador
lucius
the
roman
comes
to
milfordhaven
tomorrow
now
if
you
could
wear
a
mind
dark
as
your
fortune
is
and
but
disguise
that
which
t
appear
itself
must
not
yet
be
but
by
selfdanger
you
should
tread
a
course
pretty
and
full
of
view
yea
haply
near
the
residence
of
posthumus
so
nigh
at
least
that
though
his
actions
were
not
visible
yet
report
should
render
him
hourly
to
your
ear
as
truly
as
he
moves
o
for
such
means
though
peril
to
my
modesty
not
death
on
t
i
would
adventure
well
then
heres
the
point
you
must
forget
to
be
a
woman
change
command
into
obedience
fear
and
niceness
the
handmaids
of
all
women
or
more
truly
woman
it
pretty
self
into
a
waggish
courage
ready
in
gibes
quickanswerd
saucy
and
as
quarrelous
as
the
weasel
nay
you
must
forget
that
rarest
treasure
of
your
cheek
exposing
it
but
o
the
harder
heart
alack
no
remedy
to
the
greedy
touch
of
commonkissing
titan
and
forget
your
laboursome
and
dainty
trims
wherein
you
made
great
juno
angry
nay
be
brief
i
see
into
thy
end
and
am

his
service

him
wherein
you
are
happy
which
youll
make

sorry
that
i
must
report
ye
my
masters
enemy
our
subjects
sir
will
not
endure
his
yoke
and
for
ourself
to
show
less
sovereignty
than
they
must
needs
appear
unkinglike
so
sir
i
desire
of
you
a
conduct
over
land
to
milfordhaven
madam
all
joy
befall
your
grace
and

but
from
this
time

your
enemy
sir
the
event

the
winner
fare
you

leave
not
the
worthy
lucius
good
my
lords
till
he
have
crossd
the
severn
happiness
he
goes
hence
frowning
but
it
honours
us
that
we
have
given
him
cause
tis
all
the
better
your
valiant
britons
have
their
wishes
in
it
lucius
hath
wrote
already
to
the
emperor
how
it
goes
here
it
fits
us
therefore
ripely
our
chariots
and
horsemen
be
in
readiness
the
powers
that
he
already
hath
in
gallia
will
soon
be
drawn
to
head
from
whence
he
moves
his
war
for
britain
tis
not
sleepy
business
but
must
be
lookd
to
speedily
and
strongly
our
expectation
that
it
would
be
thus
hath
made
us
forward
but
my
gentle
queen
where
is
our
daughter
she
hath
not
appeard
before
the
roman
nor
to
us
hath
tenderd
the
duty
of
the
day
she
looks
us
like
a
thing
more
made
of
malice
than
of
duty
we
have
noted
it
call
her
before
us
for
we
have
been
too
slight
in
sufferance
royal
sir
since
the
exile
of
posthumus
most
retird
hath
her
life
been
the
cure
whereof
my
lord
tis
time
must
do
beseech
your
majesty
forbear
sharp
speeches
to
her
shes
a
lady
so
tender
of
rebukes
that
words
are
strokes
and
strokes
death
to
her
where
is
she
sir
how
can
her
contempt
be
answerd
please
you
sir
her
chambers
are
all
lockd
and
theres
no
answer
that
will
be
given
to
the
loudest
noise
we
make
my
lord
when
last
i
went
to
visit
her
she
prayd
me
to
excuse
her
keeping
close
whereto
constraind
by
her
infirmity
she
should
that
duty
leave
unpaid
to
you
which
daily
she
was
bound
to
proffer
this
she
wishd
me
to
make
known
but
our
great
court
made
me
to
blame
in
memory
her
doors
lockd
not
seen
of
late
grant
heavens
that
which
i
fear
prove
false
son
i
say
follow
the
king
that
man
of
hers
pisanio
her
old
servant
i
have
not
seen
these
two
days
go
look
after
pisanio
thou
that
standst
so
for
posthumus
he
hath
a
drug
of
mine
i
pray
his
absence
proceed
by
swallowing
that
for
he
believes
it
is
a
thing
most
precious
but
for
her
where
is
she
gone
haply
despair
hath
scizd
her
or
wingd
with
fervour
of
her
love
shes
flown
to
her
desird
posthumus
gone
she
is
to
death
or
to
dishonour
and
my
end
can
make
good
use
of
either

placing
of
the
british
crown

better

this
night
forestall
him
of
the
coming
day
i
love
and
hate
her
for
shes
fair
and
royal
and
that
she
hath
all
courtly
parts
more
exquisite
than
lady
ladies
woman
from
every
one
the
best
she
hath
and
she
of
all
compounded
outsells
them
all
i
love
her
therefore
but
disdaining
me
and
throwing
favours
on
the
low
posthumus
slanders
so
her
judgment
that
whats
else
rare
is
chokd
and
in
that
point
i
will
conclude
to
hate
her

to
be
revengd
upon
her

would

she
said
upon
a
time
the
bitterness
of
it
i
now
belch
from
my
heart
that
she
held
the
very
garment
of
posthumus
in
more
respect
than
my
noble
and
natural
person
together
with
the
adornment
of
my
qualities
with
that
suit
upon
my
back
will
i
ravish
her
first
kill
him
and
in
her
eyes
there
shall
she
see
my
valour
which
will
then
be
a
torment
to
her
contempt
he
on
the
ground
my
speech
of
insultment
ended
on
his
dead
body
and
when
my
lust
hath
dined

as
i
say
to
vex
her
i
will
execute
in
the
clothes
that
she
so
praised
to
the
court
ill
knock
her
back
foot

home

hath
despised

itself
to

boys
great

which
their

boys

go

our
hunt
fair
youth
come
in
discourse
is
heavy
fasting
when
we
have
suppd
well
mannerly
demand
thee
of
thy
story
so
far
as
thou
wilt
speak
it
pray
draw
near
the
night
to
the
owl
and
morn
to
the
lark
less
welcome
thanks
sir
i
pray
draw
near
this
is
the
tenour
of
the
emperors
writ
that
since
the
common
men
are
now
in
action
gainst
the
pannonians
and
dalmatians
and
that
the
legions
now
in
gallia
are
full
weak
to
undertake
our
wars
against
the
fallnoff
britons
that
we
do
incite
the
gentry
to
this
business
he
creates
lucius
proconsul
and
to
you
the
tribunes
for
this
immediate
levy
he
commends
his
absolute
commission
long
live
c
sar
is
lucius
general
of
the
forces
ay
remaining
now
in
gallia
with
those
legions
which
i
have
spoke
of
whereunto
your
levy
must
be
supplyant
the
words
of
your
commission
will
tie
you
to
the
numbers
and
the
time
of
their
dispatch
we
will
discharge
our
duty
i
am
near
to
the
place
where
they
should
meet
if
pisanio
have
mapped
it
truly
how
fit
his
garments
serve
me
why
should
his
mistress
who
was
made
by
him
that
made
the
tailor
not
be
fit
too
the
rather
saving
reverence
of
the
word
for
tis
said
a
womans
fitness
comes
by
fits
therein
i
must
play
the
workman
i
dare
speak
it
to
myself
for
it
is
not
vainglory
for
a
man
and
his
glass
to
confer
in
his
own
chamber
i
mean
the
lines
of
my
body
are
as
well
drawn
as
his
no
less
young
more
strong
not
beneath
him
in
fortunes
beyond
him
in
the
advantage
of
the
time
above
him
in
birth
alike
conversant
in
general
services
and
more
remarkable
in
single
oppositions
yet
this
imperceiverant
thing
loves
him
in
my
despite
what
mortality
is
posthumus
thy
head
which
now
is
growing
upon
thy
shoulders
shall
within
this
hour
be
off
thy
mistress
enforced
thy
garments
cut
to
pieces
before
thy
face
and
all
this
done
spurn
her
home
to
her
father
who
may
haply
be
a
little
angry
for
my
so
rough
usage
but
my
mother
having
power
of
his
testiness
shall
turn
all
into
my
commendations
my
horse
is
tied
up
safe
out
sword
and
to
a
sore
purpose
fortune
put
them
into
my
hand
this
is
the
very
description
of
their
meetingplace
and
the
fellow
dares
not
deceive
me

are
not
well

here
in
the
cave
well
come

you

his
neat
cookery

cut
our
roots
in
characters
and
saucd
our
broths
as
juno
had
been
sick
and
he
her
dieter
nobly
he
yokes
a
smiling
with
a
sigh
as
if
the
sigh
was
that
it
was
for
not
being
such
a
smile
the
smile
mocking
the
sigh
that
it
would
fly
from
so
divine
a
temple
to
commix
with
winds
that
sailors
rail
at
i
do
note
that
grief
and
patience
rooted
in
him
both
mingle
their
spurs
together
grow
patience
and
let
the
stinkingelder
grief
untwine
his
perishing
root
with
the
increasing
vine

sorry
for

i
reverence
those
i
fear

death

ill

fled
hence
and
on
the
gates
of
luds
town
set
your
heads
yield
rustic
mountaineer
no
companies
abroad
none
in
the
world
you
did
mistake
him
sure
i
cannot
tell
long
is
it
since
i
saw
him
but
time
hath
nothing
blurrd
those
lines
of
favour
which
then
he
wore
the
snatches
in
his
voice
and
burst
of
speaking
were
as
his
i
am
absolute
twas
very
cloten
in
this
place
we
left
them
i
wish
my
brother
make
good
time
with
him
you
say
he
is
so
fell
being
scarce
made
up
i
mean
to
man
he
had
not
apprehension
of
roaring
terrors
for
defect
of
judgment
is
oft
the
cease
of
fear
but
see
thy
brother
this
cloten
was
a
fool
an
empty
purse
there
was
no
money
in
t
not
hercules
could
have
knockd
out
his
brains
for
he
had
none
yet
i
not
doing
this
the
fool
had
borne
my
head
as
i
do
his
what
hast
thou
done
i
am
perfect
what
cut
off
one
clotens
head
son
to
the
queen
after
his
own
report
who
calld
me
traitor
mountaineer
and
swore
with
his
own
single
hand
hed
take
us
in
displace
our
heads
where
thank
the
gods
they
grow
and
set
them
on
luds
town
we
are
all
undone
why
worthy
father
what
have
we
to
lose
but
that
he
swore
to
take
our
lives
the
law
protects
not
us
then
why
should
we
be
tender
to
let
an
arrogant
piece
of
flesh
threat
us
play
judge
and
executioner
all
himself
for
we
do
fear
the
law
what
company
discover
you
abroad
no
single
soul
can
we
set
eye
on
but
in
all
safe
reason
he
must
have
some
attendants
though
his
humour
was
nothing
but
mutation
ay
and
that
from
one
bad
thing
to
worse
not
frenzy
not
absolute
madness
could
so
far
have
ravd
to
bring
him
here
alone
although
perhaps
it
may
be
heard
at
court
that
such
as
we
cave
here
hunt
here
are
outlaws
and
in
time
may
make
some
stronger
head
the
which
he
hearing
as
it
is
like
him
might
break
out
and
swear
hed
fetch
us
in
yet
is
t
not
probable
to
come
alone
either
he
so
undertaking
or
they
so
suffering
then
on
good
ground
we
fear
if
we
do
fear
this
body
hath
a
tail
more
perilous
than
the
head
let
ordinance
come
as
the
gods
foresay
it
howsoeer
my
brother
hath
done
well
i
had
no
mind
to
hunt
this
day
the
boy
fideles
sickness
did
make
my
way
long
forth
with
his
own
sword
which
he
did
wave
against
my
throat
i
have
taen
his
head
from
him
ill
throw
t
into
the
creek
behind
our
rock
and
let
it
to
the
sea
and
tell
the
fishes
hes
the
queens
son
cloten
thats
all
i
reck
i
fear
twill
be
revengd
would
polydore
thou
hadst
not
done
t
though
valour
becomes
thee
well
enough
would
i
had
done
t
so
the
revenge
alone
pursud
me
polydore
i
love
thee
brotherly
but
envy
much
thou
hast
robbd
me
of
this
deed
i
would
revenges
that
possible
strength
might
meet
would
seek
us
through
and
put
us
to
our
answer
well
tis
done
well
hunt
no
more
today
nor
seek
for
danger
where
theres
no
profit
i
prithee
to
our
rock
you
and
fidele
play
the
cooks
ill
stay
till
hasty
polydore
return
and
bring
him
to
dinner
presently
poor
sick
fidele
ill
willingly
to
him
to
gain
his
colour
id
let
a
parish
of
such
clotens
blood
and
praise
myself
for
charity
o
thou
goddess
thou
divine
nature
how
thyself
thou
blazonst
in
these
two
princely
boys
they
are
as
gentle
as
zephyrs
blowing
below
the
violet
not
wagging
his
sweet
head
and
yet
as
rough
their
royal
blood
enchafd
as
the
rudst
wind
that
by
the
top
doth
take
the
mountain
pine
and
make
him
stoop
to
the
vale
tis
wonder
that
an
invisible
instinct
should
frame
them
to
royalty
unlearnd
honour
untaught
civility
not
seen
from
other
valour
that
wildly
grows
in
them
but
yields
a
crop
as
if
it
had
been
sowd
yet
still
its
strange
what
clotens
being
here
to
us
portends
or
what
his
death
will
bring
us
wheres
my
brother
i
have
sent
clotens
clotpoll
down
the
stream
in
embassy
to
his
mother
his
bodys
hostage
for
his
return
my
ingenious
instrument
hark
polydore
it
sounds
but
what
occasion
hath
cadwal
now
to
give
it
motion
hark
is
he
at
home
he
went
hence
even
now
what
does
he
mean
since
death
of
my
dearst
mother
it
did
not
speak
before
all
solemn
things
should
answer
solemn
accidents
the
matter
triumphs
for
nothing
and
lamenting
toys
is
jollity
for
apes
and
grief
for
boys
is
cadwal
mad
look
here
he
comes
and
brings
the
dire
occasion
in
his
arms
of
what
we
blame
him
for
the
bird
is
dead
that
we
have
made
so
much
on
i
had
rather
have
skippd
from
sixteen
years
of
age
to
sixty
to
have
turnd
my
leapingtime
into
a
crutch
than
have
seen
this
o
sweetest
fairest
lily
my
brother
wears
thee
not
the
one
half
so
well
as
when
thou
grewst
thyself
o
melancholy
who
ever
yet
could
sound
thy
bottom
find
the
ooze
to
show
what
coast
thy
sluggish
crare
might
easiliest
harbour
in
thou
blessed
thing
jove
knows
what
man
thou
mightst
have
made
but
i
thou
diedst
a
most
rare
boy
of
melancholy
how
found
you
him
stark
as
you
see
thus
smiling
as
some
fly
had
tickled
slumber
not
as
deaths
dart
being
laughd
at
his
right
cheek
reposing
on
a
cushion
where
o
the
floor
his
arms
thus
leagud
i
thought
he
slept
and
put
my
clouted
brogues
from
off
my
feet
whose
rudeness
answerd
my
steps
too
loud
why
he
but
sleeps
if
he
be
gone
hell
make
his
grave
a
bed
with
female
fairies
will
his
tomb
be
haunted
and
worms
will
not
come
to
thee
with
fairest
flowers
while
summer
lasts
and
i
live
here
fidele
ill
sweeten
thy
sad
grave
thou
shalt
not
lack
the
flower
thats
like
thy
face
pale
primrose
nor
the
azurd
harebell
like
thy
veins
no
nor
the
leaf
of
eglantine
whom
not
to

outsweetend
not
thy
breath
the
ruddock
would
with
charitable

a
worthy

abhor
to

fever
with
the
absence
of
her
son
a
madness
of
which
her
lifes
in
danger
heavens
how
deeply
you
at
once
do
touch
me
imogen
the
great
part
of
my
comfort
gone
my
queen
upon
a
desperate
bed
and
in
a
time
when
fearful
wars
point
at
me
her
son
gone
so
needful
for
this
present
it
strikes
me
past
the
hope
of
comfort
but
for
thee
fellow
who
needs
must
know
of
her
departure
and
dost
seem
so
ignorant
well
enforce
it
from
thee
by
a
sharp
torture
sir
my
life
is
yours
i
humbly
set
it
at
your
will
but
for
my
mistress
i
nothing
know
where
she
remains
why
gone
nor
when
she
purposes
return
beseech
your
highness
hold
me
your
loyal
servant
good
my
liege
the
day
that
she
was
missing
he
was
here
i
dare
be
bound
hes
true
and
shall
perform
all
parts
of
his
subjection
loyally
for
cloten
there
wants
no
diligence
in
seeking
him
and
will
no
doubt
be
found
the
time
is
troublesome
well
slip
you
for
a
season
but
our
jealousy
does
yet
depend
so
pleaseyour
majesty
the
roman
legions
all
from
gallia
drawn
are
landed
on
your
coast
with
a
supply
of
roman
gentlemen
by
the
senate
sent
now
for
the
counsel
of
my
son
and
queen
i
am
amazd
with
matter
good
my
liege
your
preparation
can
affront
no
less
than
what
you
hear
of
come
more
for
more
youre
ready
the
want
is
but
to
put
those
powers
in
motion
that
long
to
move
i
thank
you
lets
withdraw
and
meet
the
time
as
it
seeks
us
we
fear
not
what
can
from
italy
annoy
us
but
we
grieve
at
chances
here
away
i
heard
no
letter
from
my
master
since
i
wrote
him
imogen
was
slain
tis
strange
nor
hear
i
from
my
mistress
who
did
promise
to
yield
me
often
tidings
neither
know
i
what
is
betid
to
cloten
but
remain
perplexd
in
all
the
heavens
still
must
work
wherein
i
am
false
i
am
honest
not
true
to
be
true
these
present
wars
shall
find
i
love
my
country
even
to
the
note
o
the
king
or
ill
fall
in
them
all
other
doubts
by
time
let
them
be
cleard
fortune
brings
in
some
boats
that
are
not
steerd
the
noise
is
round
about
us
let
us
from
it
what
pleasure
sir
find
we
in
life
to
lock
it
from
action
and
adventure
nay
what
hope
have
we
in
hiding
us
this
way
the
romans
must
or
for
britons
slay
us
or
receive
us
for
barbarous
and
unnatural
revolts
during
their
use
and
slay
us
after
sons
well
higher
to
the
mountains
there
secure
us
to
the
kings
party
theres
no
going
newness
of
clotens
death
we
being
not
known
not
musterd
among
the
bands
may
drive
us
to
a
render
where
we
have
livd
and
so
extort
from
s
that
which
we
have
done
whose
answer
would
be
death
drawn
on
with
torture
this
is
sir
a
doubt
in
such
a
time
nothing
becoming
you
nor
satisfying
us
it
is
not
likely
that
when
they
hear
the
roman
horses
neigh
behold
their
quarterd
fires
have
both
their
eyes
and
ears
so
cloyd
importantly
as
now
that
they
will
waste
their
time
upon
our
note
to
know
from
whence
we
are
o
i
am
known
of
many
in
the
army
many
years
though
cloten
then
but
young
you
see
not
wore
him
from
my
remembrance
and
besides
the
king
hath
not
deservd
my
service
nor
your
loves
who
find
in
my
exile
the
want
of
breeding
the
certainty
of
this
hard
life
aye
hopeless
to
have
the
courtesy
your
cradle
promisd
but
to
be
still
hot
summers
tanlings
and
the
shrinking
slaves
of
winter
than
be
so
better
to
cease
to
be
pray
sir
to
the
army
i
and
my
brother
are
not
known
yourself
so
out
of
thought
and
thereto
so
oergrown
cannot
be
questiond
by
this
sun
that
shines
ill
thither
what
thing
is
it
that
i
never
did
see
man
die
scarce
ever
lookd
on
blood
but
that
of
coward
hares
hot
goats
and
venison
never
bestrid
a
horse
save
one
that
had
a
rider
like
myself
who
neer
wore
rowel
nor
iron
on
his
heel
i
am
ashamd
to
look
upon
the
holy
sun
to
have
the
benefit
of
his
blessd
beams
remaining
so
long
a
poor
unknown
by
heavens
ill
go
if
you
will
bless
me
sir
and
give
me
leave
ill
take
the
better
care
but
if
you
will
not
the
hazard
therefore
due
fall
on
me
by
the
hands
of
romans
so
say
i
amen
no
reason
i
since
of
your
lives
you
set
so
slight
a
valuation
should
reserve
my
crackd
one
to
more
care
have
with
you
boys
if
in
your
country
wars
you
chance
to
die
that
is
my
bed
too
lads
and
there
ill
lie
lead
lead
the
time
seems
long
their
blood
thinks
scorn
till
it
fly
out
and
show
them
princes
born
yea
bloody
cloth
ill
keep
thee
for
i
wishd
thou
shouldst
be
colourd
thus
you
married
ones
if
each
of
you
should
take
this
course
how
many
must
murder
wives
much
better
than
themselves
for
wrying
but
a
little
o
pisanio
every
good
servant
does
not
all
commands
no
bond
but
to
do
just
ones
gods
if
you
should
have
taen
vengeance
on
my
faults
i

put
on
this
so
had
you
savd
the
noble
imogen
to
repent
and
struck
me
wretch
more
worth
your
vengeance
but
alack

snatch
some
hence
for
little
faults
thats
love
to
have
them
fall
no
more
you
some
permit
to
second
ills
with
ills
each
elder
worse
and
make
them
dread
it
to
the
doers
thrift
but
imogen
is
your
own
do
your
best
wills
and
make
me
blessd
to
obey
i
am
brought
hither
among
the
italian
gentry
and
to
fight
against
my
ladys
kingdom
tis
enough
that
britain
i
have
killd
thy
mistresspiece
ill
give
no
wound
to
thee
therefore
good
heavens
hear
patiently
my
purpose
ill
disrobe
me
of
these
italian
weeds
and
suit
myself
as
does
a
briton
peasant
so
ill
fight
against
the
part
i
come
with
so
ill
die
for
thee
o
imogen
even
for
whom
my
life
is
every
breath
a
death
and
thus
unknown
pitied
nor
hated
to
the
face
of
peril
myself
ill
dedicate
let
me
make
men
know
more
valour
in
me
than
my
habits
show
gods
put
the
strength
o
the
leonati
in
me
to
shame
the
guise
o
the

i
will
begin
the
fashion
less
without
and
more
within
the
heaviness
and
guilt
within
my
bosom
takes
off
my
manhood
i
have
belied
a
lady
the
princess
of
this
country
and
the
air
on

revengingly
enfeebles
me
or
could
this
carl
a
very
drudge
of

have
subdud
me
in
my
profession
knighthoods
and
honours
borne
as
i
wear
mine
are
titles
but
of
scorn
if
that
thy
gentry
britain
go
before
this
lout
as
he
exceeds
our
lords
the

is
that
we
scarce
are

you
are

thou

thou

created
a

and
two
brothers
but
o
scorn
gone
they
went
hence
so
soon
as
they
were

so
i
am
awake
poor
wretches
that
depend
on
greatness
favour
dream
as
i

and
find
nothing
but
alas
i
swerve
many

not

neither

am
i
that

what

be

be
lopped

being

many
years

shall
posthumus
end
his

britain
be
fortunate
and
flourish
in
peace
and
plenty
tis
still
a
dream
or
else
such
stuff
as
madmen
tongue
and
brain
not
either
both
or
nothing
or
senseless
speaking
or
a
speaking
such
as
sense
cannot
untie
be
what
it
is
the
action
of
my
life
is
like
it
which
ill
keep
if
but
for
sympathy
come
sir
are
you
ready
for
death
overroasted
rather
ready
long
ago
hanging
is
the
word
sir
if
you
be
ready
for
that
you
are
well
cooked
so
if
i
prove
a
good
repast
to
the
spectators
the
dish
pays
the
shot
a
heavy
reckoning
for
you
sir
but
the
comfort
is
you
shall
be
called
to
no
more
payments
fear
no
more
tavernbills
which
are
often
the
sadness
of
parting
as
the
procuring
of
mirth
you
come
in
faint
for
want
of
meat
depart
reeling
with
too
much
drink
sorry
that
you
have
paid
too
much
and
sorry
that
you
are
paid
too
much
purse
and
brain
both
empty
the
brain
the
heavier
for
being
too
light
the
purse
too
light
being
drawn
of
heaviness
of
this
contradiction
you
shall
now
be
quit
o
the
charity
of
a
penny
cord
it
sums
up
thousands
in
a
trice
you
have
no
true
debitor
and
creditor
but
it
of
whats
past
is
and
to
come
the
discharge
your
neck
sir
is
pen
book
and
counters
so
the
acquittance
follows
i
am
merrier
to
die
than
thou
art
to
live
indeed
sir
he
that
sleeps
feels
not
the
toothache
but
a
man
that
were
to
sleep
your
sleep
and
a
hangman
to
help
him
to
bed
i
think
he
would
change
places
with
his
officer
for
look
you
sir
you
know
not
which
way
you
shall
go
yes
indeed
do
i
fellow
your
death
has
eyes
in
s
head
then
i
have
not
seen
him
so
pictured
you
must
either
be
directed
by
some
that
take
upon
them
to
know
or
take
upon
yourself
that
which
i
am
sure
you
do
not
know
or
jump
the
after
inquiry
on
your
own
peril
and
how
you
shall
speed
in
your
journeys
end
i
think
youll
never
return
to
tell
one
i
tell
thee
fellow
there
are
none
want
eyes
to
direct
them
the
way
i
am
going
but
such
as
wink
and
will
not
use
them
what
an
infinite
mock
is
this
that
a
man
should
have
the
best
use
of
eyes
to
see
the
way
of
blindness
i
am
sure
hangings
the
way
of
winking
knock
off
his
manacles
bring
your
prisoner
to
the
king
thou
bringst
good
news
i
am
called
to
be
made
free
ill
be
hangd
then
thou
shalt
be
then
freer
than
a
gaoler
no
bolts
for
the
dead
unless
a
man
would
marry
a
gallows
and
beget
young
gibbets
i
never
saw
one
so
prone
yet
on
my
conscience
there
are
verier
knaves
desire
to
live
for
all
he
be
a
roman
and
there
be
some
of
them
too
that
die
against
their
wills
so
should
i
if
i
were
one
i
would
we
were
all
of
one
mind
and
one
mind
good

whose
naked
breast
steppd
before
targes
of

cannot
be
found
he
shall
be
happy

find
him
if

can
make
him
so
i
never
saw
such
noble
fury
in
so
poor
a
thing
such
precious
deeds
in

that
promisd
nought

beggary
and
poor
looks
no

of
him
he
hath
been
searchd
among
the
dead
and
living
but
no
trace
of
him
to
my
grief
i
am
the
heir
of
his

you
the

dying
i
would
not
believe
her
lips
in
opening
it
proceed
your
daughter
whom
she
bore
in
hand
to
love
with
such
integrity
she
did
confess
was
as
a
scorpion
to
her
sight
whose
life
but
that
her
flight
prevented
it
she
had
taen
off
by
poison
o
most
delicate
fiend

worse
she
did
confess
she
had
for
you
a
mortal
mineral
which
being
took
should
by
the
minute
feed
on

and
lingring
by

purposd
by
watching
weeping

and
in

when
she
had
fitted
you
with

son
into
the
adoption
of
the
crown
but
failing
of
her

by
his
strange
absence
grew
shamelessdesperate
opend
in
despite
of
heaven
and
men
her
purposes
repented
the
evils
she
hatchd
were
not
effected
so
despairing
died
heard
you
all
this
her
women
we
did
so
please
your
highness
mine
eyes
were
not
in
fault
for
she
was
beautiful
mine
ears
that
heard
her
flattery
nor
my
heart
that
thought
her
like
her
seeming
it
had
been
vicious
to
have
mistrusted
her
yet
o
my
daughter
that
it
was
folly
in
me
thou
mayst
say
and
prove
it
in
thy
feeling
heaven
mend
all
thou
comst
not
caius
now
for
tribute
that
the
britons
have
razd
out
though
with
the
loss
of
many
a
bold
one
whose
kinsmen
have
made
suit
that
their
good
souls
may
be
appeasd
with
slaughter
of
you
their
captives
which
ourself
have
granted

the
chance
of

not
when
the
blood
was
cool
have
threatend
our
prisoners
with
the
sword
but
since
the
gods
will
have
it
thus
that
nothing
but
our
lives
may
be
calld
ransom
let
it
come
sufficeth

clock
that

the
hour
it

accursd
the
mansion
where
twas
at
a
feast
o
would
our
viands
had
been
poisond
or
at
least
those
which
i
heavd
to
head
the
good
posthumus
what
should
i
say
he
was
too
good
to
be
where
ill
men
were
and
was
the
best
of
all
amongst
the
rarst
of
good
ones
sitting
sadly
hearing
us
praise
our
loves
of
italy
for
beauty
that
made
barren
the
swelld
boast
of
him
that
best
could
speak
for
feature
laming
the
shrine
of
venus
or
straightpight
minerva
postures
beyond
brief
nature
for
condition
a
shop
of
all
the
qualities
that
man
loves
woman
for
besides
that
hook
of
wiving
fairness
which
strikes
the
eye
i
stand
on
fire
come
to
the
matter
all
too
soon
i
shall
unless
thou
wouldst
grieve
quickly
this
posthumus
most
like
a
noble
lord
in
love
and
one
that
had
a
royal
lover
took
his
hint
and
not
dispraising
whom
we
praisd
therein
he
was
as
calm
as
virtue
he
began
his
mistress
picture
which
by
his
tongue
being
made
and
then
a
mind
put
in
t
either
our
brags
were
crackd
of
kitchen
trulls
or
his
description
provd
us
unspeaking
sots
nay
nay
to
the
purpose
your
daughters
chastity
there
it
begins
he
spake
of
her
as
dian
had
hot
dreams
and
she
alone
were
cold
whereat
i
wretch
made
scruple
of
his
praise
and
wagerd
with
him
pieces
of
gold
gainst
this
which
then
he
wore
upon
his
honourd
finger
to
attain
in
suit
the
place
of
his
bed
and
win
this
ring
by
hers
and
mine
adultery
he
true
knight
no
lesser
of
her
honour
confident
than
i
did
truly
find
her
stakes
this
ring
and
would
so
had
it
been
a
carbuncle
of
ph
bus
wheel
and
might
so
safely
had
it
been
all
the
worth
of
s
car
away
to
britain
post
i
in
this
design
well
may
you
sir
remember
me
at
court
where
i
was
taught
of
your
chaste
daughter
the
wide
difference
twixt
amorous
and
villanous
being
thus
quenchd
of
hope
not
longing
mine
italian
brain
gan
in
your
duller
britain
operate
most
vilely
for
my
vantage
excellent
and
to
be
brief
my
practice
so
prevaild
that
i
returnd
with
simular
proof
enough
to
make
the
noble
leonatus
mad
by
wounding
his
belief
in
her
renown
with
tokens
thus
and
thus
averring
notes
of
chamberhanging
pictures
this
her
bracelet
oh
cunning
how
i
got
it
nay
some
marks
of
secret
on
her
person
that
he
could
not
but
think
her
bond
of
chastity
quite
crackd
i
having
taen
the
forfeit
whereupon
methinks
i
see
him
now

mouth
and
swore
if
i
discoverd
not
which
way
she
was
gone
it
was
my
instant
death
by
accident
i
had
a
feigned
letter
of
my
masters
then
in
my
pocket
which
directed
him
to
seek
her
on
the
mountains
near
to
milford
where
in
a
frenzy
in
my
masters
garments
which
he
enforcd
from
me
away
he
posts
with
unchaste
purpose
and
with
oath
to
violate
my
ladys
honour
what
became
of
him
i
further
know
not
let
me
end
the
story
i
slew
him
there

gods
forfend
i
would
not
thy
good
deeds
should
from
my
lips
pluck
a
hard
sentence
prithee
valiant
youth
deny
t
again
i
have
spoke
it
and
i
did
it
he
was
a
prince
a
most
incivil
one
the
wrongs
he
did
me
were
nothing
princelike
for
he
did
provoke
me
with
language
that
would
make
me
spurn
the
sea
if
it
could
so
roar
to
me
i
cut
off
s
head
and
am
right
glad
he
is
not
standing
here
to
tell
this
tale
of
mine
i
am
sorry
for
thee
by
thine
own
tongue
thou
art
condemnd
and
must
endure
our
law

that
headless
man
i
thought
had
been
my
lord
bind
the
offender
and
take
him
from
our
presence
stay
sir
king
this
man
is
better
than
the
man
he
slew
as
well
descended
as
thyself
and
hath
more
of
thee
merited
than
a
band
of
clotens
had
ever
scar
for
let
his
arms
alone
they
were
not
born
for
bondage
why
old
soldier
wilt
thou
undo
the
worth
thou
art
unpaid
for
by
tasting
of
our
wrath
how
of
descent
as
good
as
we
in
that
he
spake
too
far
and
thou
shalt
die
for
t
we
will
die
all
three
but
i
will
prove
that
two
on
s
are
as
good
as
i
have
given
out
him
my
sons
i
must
for
mine
own
part
unfold
a
dangerous
speech
though
haply
well
for
you

dangers

my

so
sure
as
you
your
fathers
i
old

that
belarius
whom
you
sometime
banishd
your
pleasure
was
my
mere
offence
my
punishment
itself
and
all
my
treason
that
i
sufferd
was
all
the
harm
i
did
these
gentle
princes
for
such
and
so
they
are
these
twenty
years

traind
up
those
arts

could
put
into
them

their
heads
like
dew
for
they
are
worthy
to
inlay
heaven
with
stars
thou
weepst
and
speakst
the
service
that
you
three
have
done
is
more
unlike
than
this

children

not
how
to
wish

more
probation

can
with
ease

how
much
more
should
be
demanded
and
all
the

but
nor

long
intergatories

and
she
like
harmless
lightning
throws
her
eye
on
him
her
brothers

object
with
a
joy
the
counterchange

my
good

i
will
yet
do
you
service
happy

forlorn
soldier

of
a
king
i

soldier
that

heavy
conscience
sinks

that
i
can
make
no

of
it
let

show
his
skill
in
the
construction
philarmonus
here
my
good

read
and
declare
the

whenas
a
lions
whelp
shall
to
himself
unknown
without

find
and
be
embraced
by
a
piece
of

the

apt
construction
of
thy

being

doth
import
so
much
the
piece
of
tender

thy
virtuous
daughter
which
we
call
mollis
aer
and
mollis
aer
we
term
it
mulier
which
mulier
i
divine
is
this
most
constant
wife
who
even
now
answering
the
letter
of
the
oracle
unknown
to
you
unsought
were
clippd
about
with

hath
some
seeming
the

cymbeline
personates
thee
and
thy

branches
point
thy
two
sons
forth
who
by
belarius
stolen
for
many
years
thought
dead
are
now
revivd
to
the
majestic
cedar

whose
issue
promises
britain
peace
and

well
my
peace

will
begin

although
the

we
submit
to
c

to
the

promising
to
pay
our
wonted
tribute
from
the
which
we
were
dissuaded
by
our
wicked
queen
whom
heavens
in
justice
both
on
her
and
hers
have
laid
most
heavy
hand
the
fingers
of
the
powers
above
do
tune
the
harmony
of
this
peace
the
vision
which
i
made
known
to
lucius
ere
the
stroke
of

which
foreshowd
our

should
again
unite
his
favour
with
the
radiant
cymbeline
which
shines
here
in
the
west
laud
we
the
gods
and
let
our
crooked
smokes
climb
to
their
nostrils
from
our
blessd
altars
publish

this
peace
to
all
our
subjects
set

forward
let
a

our
peace
well
ratify

it
with
feasts
set
on
there
never
was
a
war
did
cease
ere

lost
let
fame
that
all
hunt
after
in
their
lives
live
registerd
upon

then
grace
us
in
the
disgrace
of

for
so
you

the
huge
army

berowne
dumaine

longaville
have
sworn
for
three
years

live
with
me
my
fellowscholars
and
to
keep
those
statutes
that
are
recorded
in
this
schedule
here
your
oaths
are
passd
and
now
subscribe
your
names
that
his
own
hand
may
strike
his
honour
down
that
violates
the
smallest
branch
herein
if
you

armd
to

as
sworn
to
do
subscribe
to
your
deep
oaths
and
keep
it
too
i
am
resolvd

but
a
three
years

the
mind
shall
banquet
though
the
body
pine
fat
paunches
have
lean
pates
and
dainty
bits
make
rich
the
ribs
but
bankrupt
quite
the
wits
my
loving
lord
dumaine
is
mortified
the
grosser
manner
of
these
worlds
delights
he
throws
upon
the
gross
worlds
baser
slaves
to
love
to
wealth
to
pomp
i
pine
and
die
with
all
these
living
in
philosophy
i
can
but
say
their
protestation
over
so
much
dear
liege
i
have
already
sworn
that
is
to
live
and
study
here
three
years
but
there
are
other
strict
observances
as
not
to
see
a
woman
in
that
term
which
i
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
and
one
day
in
a
week
to
touch
no
food
and
but
one
meal
on
every
day
beside
the
which
i
hope
is
not
enrolled
there
and
then
to
sleep
but
three
hours
in
the
night
and
not
be
seen
to
wink
of
all
the
day
when
i
was
wont
to
think
no
harm
all
night
and
make
a
dark
night
too
of
half
the
day
which
i
hope
well
is
not
enrolled
there
o
these
are
barren
tasks
too
hard
to
keep
not
to
see
ladies
study
fast
not
sleep
your
oath
is
passd
to
pass
away
from
these
let
me
say
no
my
liege
an
if
you
please
i
only
swore
to
study
with
your
grace
and
stay
here
in
your
court
for
three
years
space
you
swore
to
that
berowne
and
to
the
rest
by
yea
and
nay
sir
then
i
swore
in
jest
what
is
the
end
of
study
let
me
know
why
that
to
know
which
else
we
should
not
know
things
hid
and
barrd
you
mean
from
common
sense
ay
that
is
studys
godlike
recompense
come
on
then
i
will
swear
to
study
so
to
know
the
thing
i
am
forbid
to
know
as
thus
to
study
where
i
well
may
dine
when
i
to
feast
expressly
am
forbid
or
study
where
to
meet
some
mistress
fine
when
mistresses
from
common
sense
are
hid
or
having
sworn
too
hardakeeping
oath
study
to
break
it
and
not
break
my
troth
if
studys
gain
be
thus
and
this
be
so
study
knows
that
which
yet
it
doth
not
know
swear
me
to
this
and
i
will
neer
say
no
these
be
the
stops
that
hinder
study
quite
and
train
our
intellects
to
vain
delight
why
all
delights
are
vain
but
that
most
vain
which
with
pain
purchasd
doth
inherit
pain
as
painfully
to
pore
upon
a
book
to
seek
the
light
of
truth
while
truth
the
while
doth
falsely
blind
the
eyesight
of
his
look
light
seeking
light
doth
light
of
light
beguile
so
ere
you
find
where
light
in
darkness
lies
your
light
grows
dark
by
losing
of
your
eyes
study
me
how
to
please
the
eye
indeed
by
fixing
it
upon
a
fairer
eye
who
dazzling
so
that
eye
shall
be
his
heed
and
give
him
light
that
it
was
blinded
by
study
is
like
the
heavens
glorious
sun
that
will
not
be
deepsearchd
with
saucy
looks
small
have
continual
plodders
ever
won
save
base
authority
from
others
books
these
earthly
godfathers
of
heavens
lights
that
give
a
name
to
every
fixed
star
have
no
more
profit
of
their
shining
nights
than
those
that
walk
and
wot
not
what
they
are
too
much
to
know
is
to
know
nought
but
fame
and
every
godfather
can
give
a
name
how
well
hes
read
to
reason
against
reading
proceeded
well
to
stop
all
good
proceeding
he
weeds
the
corn
and
still
lets
grow
the
weeding
the
spring
is
near
when
green
geese
are
abreeding
how
follows
that
fit
in
his
place
and
time
in
reason
nothing
something
then
in
rime
berowne
is
like
an
envious
sneaping
frost
that
bites
the
firstborn
infants
of
the
spring
well
say
i
am
why
should
proud
summer
boast
before
the
birds
have
any
cause
to
sing
why
should
i
joy
in
an
abortive
birth
at
christmas
i
no
more
desire
a
rose
than
wish
a
snow
in
mays
newfangled
mirth
but
like
of
each
thing
that
in
season
grows
so
you
to
study
now
it
is
too
late
climb
oer
the
house
to
unlock
the
little
gate
well
sit
you
out
go
home
berowne
adieu
no
my
good
lord
i
have
sworn
to
stay
with
you
and
though
i
have
for
barbarism
spoke
more
than
for
that
angel
knowledge
you
can
say
yet
confident
ill
keep
to
what
i
swore
and
bide
the
penance
of
each
three
years
day
give
me
the
paper
let
me
read
the
same
and
to
the
strictst
decrees
ill
write
my
name
how
well
this
yielding
rescues
thee
from
shame
item
that
no
woman
shall
come
within
a
mile
of
my
court
hath
this
been
proclaimed
four
days
ago
lets
see
the
penalty
on
pain
of
losing
her
tongue
who
devised
this
penalty
marry
that
did
i
sweet
lord
and
why
to
fright
them
hence
with
that
dread
penalty
a
dangerous
law
against
gentility
item
if
any
man
be
seen
to
talk
with
a
woman
within
the
term
of
three
years
he
shall
endure
such
public
shame
as
the
rest
of
the
court
can
possibly
devise
this
article
my
liege
yourself
must
break
for
well
you
know
here
comes
in
embassy
the
french
kings
daughter
with
yourself
to
speak
a
maid
of
grace
and
complete
majesty
about
surrender
up
of
aquitaine
to
her
decrepit
sick
and
bedrid
father
therefore
this
article
is
made
in
vain
or
vainly
comes
th
admired
princess
hither
what
say
you
lords
why
this
was
quite
forgot
so
study
evermore
is
overshot
while
it
doth
study
to
have
what
it
would
it
doth
forget
to
do
the
thing
it
should
and
when
it
hath
the
thing
it
hunteth
most
tis
won
as
towns
with
fire
so
won
so
lost
we
must
of
force
dispense
with
this
decree
she
must
lie
here
on
mere
necessity
necessity
will
make
us
all
forsworn
three
thousand
times
within
this
three
years
space
for
every
man
with
his
affects
is
born
not
by
might
masterd
but
by
special
grace
if
i
break
faith
this
word
shall
speak
for
me
i
am
forsworn
on
mere
necessity
so
to
the
laws
at
large
i
write
my
name
and
he
that
breaks
them
in
the
least
degree
stands
in
attainder
of
eternal
shame
suggestions
are
to
others
as
to
me
but
i
believe
although
i
seem
so
loath
i
am
the
last
that
will
last
keep
his
oath
but
is
there
no
quick
recreation
granted
ay
that
there
is
our
court
you
know
is
haunted
with
a
refined
traveller
of
spain
a
man
in
all
the
worlds
new
fashion
planted
that
hath
a
mint
of

not
a

yet
so

i
did
commend
the
blackoppressing
humour
to
the
most
wholesome
physic
of
thy
healthgiving
air
and
as
i
am
a
gentleman
betook
myself
to
walk

when
about

sixth
hour
when
beasts
most
graze
birds
best
peck
and
men
sit
down
to
that
nourishment
which
is
called
supper
so
much
for
the
time
when
now
for
the
ground
which
which
i
mean
i
walked
upon
it
is
ycleped
thy
park
then
for
the
place
where
where
i
mean
i
did
encounter
that
most
obscene
and
preposterous
event
that
draweth
from
my
snowwhite
pen
the
eboncoloured
ink
which
here
thou
viewest

but
to
the
place
where
it
standeth
northnortheast
and
by
east
from
the
west
corner
of
thy
curiousknotted
garden
there
did
i
see
that
lowspirited
swain
that
base
minnow
of
thy
mirth
me
that
unlettered
smallknowing

me
that
shallow
vessel
still

which
as
i
remember
hight
costard
o
me
sorted
and
consorted
contrary
to
thy
established
proclaimed
edict
and
continent
canon
with
with
o
with

with
this
i
passion
to
say
wherewith
with
a
wench
with
a
child
of
our
grandmother

a
female
or
for
thy
more
sweet
understanding
a

i
as
my
everesteemed

me
on

of
good

me
ant
please
you
i
am

dull
for
jaquenetta
so
is
the
weaker
vessel
called
which
i
apprehended
with
the
aforesaid
swain
i
keep
her
as
a
vessel
of
thy
laws
fury
and
shall
at
the
least
of
thy
sweet
notice
bring
her
to
trial
thine
in
all
compliments
of
devoted
and
heartburning
heat
of
duty
this
is
not
so
well
as
i
looked
for
but
the
best
that
ever
i
heard
ay
the
best
for
the
worst
but
sirrah
what
say
you
to
this
sir
i
confess
the
wench
did
you
hear
the
proclamation
i
do
confess
much
of
the
hearing
it
but
little
of
the
marking
of
it
it
was
proclaimed
a
years
imprisonment
to
be
taken
with
a
wench
i
was
taken
with
none
sir
i
was
taken
with
a
damosel
well
it
was
proclaimed
damosel
this
was
no
damosel
neither
sir
she
was
a
virgin
it
is
so
varied
too
for
it
was
proclaimed
virgin
if
it
were
i
deny
her
virginity
i
was
taken
with
a
maid
this
maid
will
not
serve
your
turn
sir
this
maid
will
serve
my
turn
sir
sir
i
will
pronounce
your
sentence
you
shall
fast
a
week
with
bran
and
water
i
had
rather
pray
a
month
with
mutton
and
porridge
and
don
armado
shall
be
your
keeper
my
lord
berowne
see
him
deliverd
oer
and
go
we
lords
to
put
in
practice
that
which
each
to
other
hath
so
strongly
sworn
ill
lay
my
head
to
any
good
mans
hat
these
oaths
and
laws
will
prove
an
idle
scorn
sirrah
come
on
i
suffer
for
the
truth
sir
for
true
it
is
i
was
taken
with
jaquenetta
and
jaquenetta
is
a
true
girl
and
therefore
welcome
the
sour
cup
of
prosperity
affliction
may
one
day
smile
again
and
till
then
sit
thee
down
sorrow
boy
what
sign
is
it
when
a
man
of
great
spirit
grows
melancholy
a
great
sign
sir
that
he
will
look
sad
why
sadness
is
one
and
the
selfsame
thing
dear
imp
no
no
o
lord
sir
no
how
canst
thou
part
sadness
and
melancholy
my
tender
juvenal
by
a
familiar
demonstration
of
the
working
my
tough
senior
why
tough
senior
why
tough
senior
why
tender
juvenal
why
tender
juvenal
i
spoke
it
tender
juvenal
as
a
congruent
epitheton
appertaining
to
thy
young
days
which
we
may
nominate
tender
and
i
tough
senior
as
an
appertinent
title
to
your
old
time
which
we
may
name
tough
pretty
and
apt
how
mean
you
sir
i
pretty
and
my
saying
apt
or
i
apt
and
my
saying
pretty
thou
pretty
because
little
little
pretty
because
little
wherefore
apt
and
therefore
apt
because
quick
speak
you
this
in
my
praise
master
in
thy
condign
praise
i
will
praise
an
eel
with
the
same
praise
what
that
an
eel
is
ingenious
that
an
eel
is
quick
i
do
say
thou
art
quick
in
answers
thou
heatest
my
blood
i
am
answered
sir
i
love
not
to
be
crossed
he
speaks
the
mere
contrary
crosses
love
not
him
i
have
promised
to
study
three
years
with
the
duke
you
may
do
it
in
an
hour
sir
impossible
how
many
is
one
thrice
told
i
am
ill
at
reckoning
it
fitteth
the
spirit
of
a
tapster
you
are
a
gentleman
and
a
gamester
sir
i
confess
both
they
are
both
the
varnish
of
a
complete
man
then
i
am
sure
you
know
how
much
the
gross
sum
of
deuceace
amounts
to
it
doth
amount
to
one
more
than
two
which
the
base
vulgar
do
call
three
true
why
sir
is
this
such
a
piece
of
study
now
heres
three
studied
ere
youll
thrice
wink
and
how
easy
it
is
to
put
years
to
the
word
three
and
study
three
years
in
two
words
the
dancing
horse
will
tell
you
a
most
fine
figure
to
prove
you
a
cipher
i
will
hereupon
confess
i
am
in
love
and
as
it
is
base
for
a
soldier
to
love
so
am
i
in
love
with
a
base
wench
if
drawing
my
sword
against
the
humour
of
affection
would
deliver
me
from
the
reprobate
thought
of
it
i
would
take
desire
prisoner
and
ransom
him
to
any
french
courtier
for
a
new
devised
curtsy
i
think
scorn
to
sigh
methinks
i
should
outswear
cupid
comfort
me
boy
what
great
men
have
been
in
love
hercules
master
most
sweet
hercules
more
authority
dear
boy
name
more
and
sweet
my
child
let
them
be
men
of
good
repute
and
carriage
samson
master
he
was
a
man
of
good
carriage
great
carriage
for
he
carried
the
towngates
on
his
back
like
a
porter
and
he
was
in
love
o
wellknit
samson
strongjointed
samson
i
do
excel
thee
in
my
rapier
as
much
as
thou
didst
me
in
carrying
gates
i
am
in
love
too
who
was
samsons
love
my
dear
moth
a
woman
master
of
what
complexion
of
all
the
four
or
the
three
or
the
two
or
one
of
the
four
tell
me
precisely
of
what
complexion
of
the
seawater
green
sir
is
that
one
of
the
four
complexions
as
i
have
read
sir
and
the
best
of
them
too
green
indeed
is
the
colour
of
lovers
but
to
have
a
love
of
that
colour
methinks
samson
had
small
reason
for
it
he
surely
affected
her
for
her
wit
it
was
so
sir
for
she
had
a
green
wit
my
love
is
most
immaculate
white
and
red
most
maculate
thoughts
master
are
masked
under
such
colours
define
define
welleducated
infant
my
fathers
wit
and
my
mothers
tongue
assist
me
sweet
invocation
of
a
child
most
pretty
and
pathetical
if
she
be
made
of
white
and
red
her
faults
will
neer
be
known
for
blushing
cheeks
by
faults
are
bred
and
fears
by
pale
white
shown
then
if
she
fear
or
be
to
blame
by
this
you
shall
not
know
for
still
her
cheeks
possess
the
same
which
native
she
doth
owe
a
dangerous
rime
master
against
the
reason
of
white
and
red
is
there
not
a
ballad
boy
of
the
king
and
the
beggar
the
world
was
very
guilty
of
such
a
ballad
some
three
ages
since
but
i
think
now
tis
not
to
be
found
or
if
it
were
it
would
neither
serve
for
the
writing
nor
the
tune
i
will
have
that
subject
newly
writ
oer
that
i
may
example
my
digression
by
some
mighty
precedent
boy
i
do
love
that
country
girl
that
i
took
in
the
park
with
the
rational
hind
costard
she
deserves
well
to
be
whipped
and
yet
a
better
love
than
my
master
sing
boy
my
spirit
grows
heavy
in
love
and
thats
great
marvel
loving
a
light
wench
i
say
sing
forbear
till
this
company
be
past
sir
the
dukes
pleasure
is
that
you
keep
costard
safe
and
you
must
let
him
take
no
delight
nor
no
penance
but
a
must
fast
three
days
a
week
for
this
damsel
i
must
keep
her
at
the
park
she
is
allowed
for
the
daywoman
fare
you
well
i
do
betray
myself
with
blushing
maid
man
i
will
visit
thee
at
the
lodge
thats
hereby
i
know
where
it
is
situate
lord
how
wise
you
are
i
will
tell
thee
wonders
with
that
face
i
love
thee
so
i
heard
you
say
and
so
farewell
fair
weather
after
you
come
jaquenetta
away
villain
thou
shalt
fast
for
thy
offences
ere
thou
be
pardoned
well
sir
i
hope
when
i
do
it
i
shall
do
it
on
a
full
stomach
thou
shalt
be
heavily
punished
i
am
more
bound
to
you
than
your
fellows
for
they
are
but
lightly
rewarded
take
away
this
villain
shut
him
up
come
you
transgressing
slave
away
let
me
not
be
pent
up
sir
i
will
fast
being
loose
no
sir
that
were
fast
and
loose
thou
shalt
to
prison
well
if
ever
i
do
see
the
merry
days
of
desolation
that
i
have
seen
some
shall
see
what
shall
some
see
nay
nothing
master
moth
but
what
they
look
upon
it
is
not
for
prisoners
to
be
too
silent
in
their
words
and
therefore
i
will
say
nothing
i
thank
god
i
have
as
little
patience
as
another
man
and
therefore
i
can
be
quiet
i
do
affect
the
very
ground
which
is
base
where
her
shoe
which
is
baser
guided
by
her
foot
which
is
basest
doth
tread
i
shall
be
forsworn
which
is
a
great
argument
of
falsehood
if
i
love
and
how
can
that
be
true
love
which
is
falsely
attempted
love
is
a
familiar
love
is
a
devil
there
is
no
evil
angel
but
love
yet
was
samson
so
tempted
and
he
had
an
excellent
strength
yet
was
solomon
so
seduced
and
he
had
a
very
good
wit
cupids
buttshaft
is
too
hard
for
hercules
club
and
therefore
too
much
odds
for
a
spaniards
rapier
the
first
and
second
clause
will
not
serve
my
turn
the
passado
he
respects
not
the
duello
he
regards
not
his
disgrace
is
to
be
called
boy
but
his
glory
is
to
subdue
men
adieu
valour
rust
rapier
be
still
drum
for
your
manager
is
in

yea
he
loveth
assist

to
do
most
harm
least
knowing
ill
for
he
hath
wit
to
make
an
ill
shape
good
and
shape
to
win
grace
though
he
had
no
wit
i
saw
him
at
the
duke
alen
ons
once
and
much
too
little
of
that
good
i
saw
is
my
report
to
his
great
worthiness
another
of
these
students
at
that
time
was
there
with
him
if
i
have
heard
a
truth
berowne
they
call
him
but
a
merrier
man
within
the
limit
of
becoming
mirth
i
never
spent
an
hours
talk
withal
his
eye
begets
occasion
for
his
wit
for
every
object
that
the
one
doth
catch
the
other
turns
to
a
mirthmoving
jest
which
his
fair
tongue
conceits
expositor
delivers
in
such
apt
and
gracious
words
that
aged
ears
play
truant
at
his
tales
and
younger
hearings
are
quite
ravished
so
sweet
and
voluble
is
his
discourse
god
bless
my
ladies
are
they
all
in
love
that
every
one
her
own
hath
garnished
with
such
bedecking
ornaments
of
praise

were
all
addressd
to
meet
you
gentle
lady
before
i
came
marry
thus
much
i
have
learnt
he
rather
means
to
lodge
you
in
the
field
like
one
that
comes
here
to
besiege
his
court
than
seek
a
dispensation
for
his
oath
to
let

enter
his
unpeeled
house

his
knowledge

grace
hath
sworn

tis
deadly
sin
to
keep
that
oath

lord
and

of
you

spur
me
with

madam
your
father
here
doth
intimate
the
payment
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
being
but
the
one
half
of
an
entire
sum
disbursed
by
my
father
in
his
wars
but
say
that
he
or
we
as
neither
have
receivd
that
sum
yet
there
remains
unpaid
a
hundred
thousand
more
in
surety
of
the
which
one
part
of
aquitaine
is
bound
to
us
although
not
valud
to
the
moneys
worth
if
then
the
king
your
father
will
restore
but
that
one
half
which
is
unsatisfied
we
will
give
up
our
right
in
aquitaine
and
hold
fair
friendship
with
his
majesty
but
that
it
seems
he
little
purposeth
for
here
he
doth
demand
to
have
repaid
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
and
not
demands
on
payment
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
to
have
his
title
live
in
aquitaine
which
we
much
rather
had
depart
withal
and
have
the
money
by
our
father
lent
than
aquitaine
so
gelded
as
it
is
dear
princess
were
not
his
requests
so
far
from
reasons
yielding
your
fair
self
should
make
a
yielding
gainst
some
reason
in
my
breast
and
go
well
satisfied
to
france
again
you
do
the
king
my
father
too
much
wrong
and
wrong
the
reputation
of
your
name
in
so
unseeming
to
confess
receipt
of
that
which
hath
so
faithfully
been
paid
i
do
protest
i
never
heard
of
it
and
if

prove
it
ill

yield
up
aquitaine

arrest
your
word

every
jest
but
a
word
it
was
well
done
of
you
to
take
him
at
his
word
i
was
as
willing
to
grapple
as
he
was
to
board
two
hot
sheeps

this
civil

much
better
usd
on
navarre

his
bookmen
for
here
tis
abusd
if
my
observation
which
very
seldom
lies
by
the
hearts
still
rhetoric
disclosed
with
eyes
deceive
me
not
now
navarre
is
infected
with
what
with
that
which
we
lovers
entitle
affected
your
reason
why
all
his
behaviours
did
make
their
retire
to
the
court
of
his
eye
peeping
thorough
desire
his
heart
like
an
agate
with
your
print
impressd
proud
with
his
form
in
his
eye
pride
expressd
his
tongue
all
impatient
to
speak
and
not
see
did
stumble
with
haste
in
his
eyesight
to
be
all
senses
to
that
sense
did
make
their
repair
to
feel
only
looking
on
fairest
of
fair
methought
all
his
senses
were
lockd
in
his
eye
as
jewels
in
crystal
for
some
prince
to
buy
who
tendring
their
own
worth
from
where
they
were
glassd
did
point
you
to
buy
them
along
as
you
passd
his
faces
own
margent
did
quote
such
amazes
that
all
eyes
saw
his
eyes
enchanted
with
gazes
ill
give
you
aquitaine
and
all
that
is
his
an
you
give
him
for
my
sake
but
one
loving
kiss

our
pavilion
boyet

disposd
but
to
speak
that
in
words
which
his
eye
hath
disclosd
i
only
have
made
a
mouth
of
his
eye
by
adding
a
tongue
which
i
know
will
not
he
thou
art
an
old
lovemonger
and
speakst
skilfully
he
is
cupids

with
turning
up
your
eyelids
sigh
a
note
and
sing
a
note
sometime
through
the
throat
as
if
you
swallowed
love
by
singing
love
sometime
through
the
nose
as
if
you
snuffed
up
love
by
smelling
love
with
your
hat
penthouselike
oer
the
shop
of
your
eyes
with
your
arms
crossed
on
your
thin
bellydoublet
like
a
rabbit
on
a
spit
or
your
hands
in
your
pocket
like
a
man
after
the
old
painting
and
keep
not

long
in
one
tune
but
a
snip
and
away
these
are
complements

her
because
your
heart

her
because
your

with
her
and
out

i

not
but
i
think
it
was
not
he
whoeer
a
was
a

a
mounting
mind
well
lords
today
we
shall
have
our
dispatch
on
saturday
we
will
return
to
france
then
forester
my
friend
where
is
the
bush
that
we
must
stand
and
play
the
murderer
in
hereby
upon
the
edge
of
yonder
coppice
a
stand
where
you
may
make
the
fairest
shoot
i
thank
my
beauty
i
am
fair
that
shoot
and
thereupon
thou
speakst
the
fairest
shoot
pardon
me
madam
for
i
meant
not
so
what
what
first
praise
me
and
again
say
no
o
shortlivd
pride
not
fair
alack
for
woe
yes
madam
fair
nay
never
paint
me
now
where
fair
is
not
praise
cannot
mend
the
brow
here
good
my
glass
take
this
for
telling
true
fair
payment
for
foul
words
is
more
than
due
nothing
but
fair
is
that
which
you
inherit
see
see
my
beauty
will
be
savd
by
merit
o
heresy
in
fair
fit
for
these
days
a
giving
hand
though
foul
shall
have
fair
praise
but
come
the
bow
now
mercy
goes
to
kill
and
shooting
well
is
then
accounted
ill
thus
will
i
save
my
credit
in
the
shoot
not
wounding
pity
would
not
let
me
dot
if
wounding
then
it
was
to
show
my
skill
that
more
for
praise
than
purpose
meant
to
kill
and
out
of
question
so
it
is
sometimes
glory
grows
guilty
of
detested
crimes
when
for
fames
sake
for
praise
an
outward
part
we
bend
to
that
the
working
of
the
heart
as
i
for
praise
alone
now
seek
to
spill
the
poor
deers
blood
that
my
heart
means
no
ill
do
not
curst
wives
hold
that
selfsovereignty
only
for
praise
sake
when
they
strive
to
be
lords
oer
their
lords
only
for
praise
and
praise
we
may
afford
to
any
lady
that
subdues
a
lord

of
the

have
commiseration
on
thy
heroical
vassal
the
magnanimous
and
most
illustrate
king
cophetua
set
eye
upon
the
pernicious
and
indubitate
beggar
zenelophon
and
he
it
was
that

rightly
say
veni

vici
which
to
anatomize
in
the
vulgar
o
base
and
obscure
vulgar
videlicet
he
came

came
one

conclusion

the
catastrophe
is
a

pathetical
nit

very
reverend
sport
truly
and
done
in
the
testimony
of

the

as
you

ripe
as
a
pomewater

truly
master
holofernes
the

are
sweetly
varied
like
a

at

least
but
sir
i
assure
ye
it
was
a
buck
of
the
first
head
sir
nathaniel
haud
credo
twas
not
a
haud

twas
a
pricket
most
barbarous
intimation
yet
a
kind
of
insinuation
as
it
were
in
via
in
way
of
explication
facere
as
it
were
replication
or
rather
ostentare
to
show
as
it
were
his
inclination
after
his
undressed
unpolished
uneducated
unpruned
untrained
or
rather
unlettered
or
ratherest
unconfirmed
fashion
to
insert
again
my
haud
credo
for
a

i
said
the
deer
was
not
a
haud
credo
twas
a

twice
sod

how

sir
he
hath
not

that

of
a

he
hath
not
eat
paper
as
it
were
he
hath
not
drunk
ink
his
intellect
is
not
replenished
he
is
only
an
animal
only
sensible
in
the
duller
parts
and
such
barren
plants
are
set
before
us
that
we
thankful
should
be
which
we
of
taste
and
feeling
are
for
those
parts
that
do
fructify
in
us
more
than
he
for
as
it
would
ill
become
me
to
be
vain
indiscreet
or
a
fool
so
were
there
a
patch
set
on
learning
to
see
him
in

but
omne
bene
say
i
being
of
an
old

mind
many
can
brook
the

that

god
comfort
thy

i
say
the
allusion
holds
in

and
i
say
the
pollusion
holds
in
the
exchange
for

is
never
but
a
month
old
and
i
say
beside
that
twas
a
pricket
that
the
princess
killed
sir
nathaniel
will
you
hear
an
extemporal
epitaph
on

that
i
have
simple

a

full
of

i
do
nothing

to

and
to

behold
the
tears
that
swell
in

and
they
thy
glory
through

you

young
blood
doth
not
obey
an
old
decree
we
cannot
cross
the
cause
why
we
were
born
therefore
of
all
hands
must
we
be
forsworn
what
did
these
rent
lines
show
some
love
of
thine
did
they
quoth
you
who
sees
the
heavenly
rosaline
that
like
a
rude
and
savage
man
of
inde
at
the
first
opening
of
the
gorgeous
east
bows
not
his
vassal
head
and
strucken
blind
kisses
the
base
ground
with
obedient
breast
what
peremptory
eaglesighted
eye
dares
look
upon
the
heaven
of
her
brow
that
is
not
blinded
by
her
majesty
what
zeal
what
fury
hath
inspird
thee
now
my
love
her
mistress
is
a
gracious
moon
she
an
attending
star
scarce
seen
a
light
my
eyes
are
then
no
eyes
nor
i
berowne
o
but
for
my
love
day
would
turn
to
night
of
all
complexions
the
culld
sovereignty
do
meet
as
at
a
fair
in
her
fair
cheek
where
several
worthies
make
one
dignity
where
nothing
wants
that
want
itself
doth
seek
lend
me
the
flourish
of
all
gentle
tongues
fie
painted
rhetoric
o
she
needs
it
not
to
things
of
sale
a
sellers
praise
belongs
she
passes
praise
then
praise
too
short
doth
blot
a
witherd
hermit
fivescore
winters
worn
might
shake
off
fifty
looking
in
her
eye
beauty
doth
varnish
age
as
if
newborn
and
gives
the
crutch
the
cradles
infancy
o
tis
the
sun
that
maketh
all
things
shine
by
heaven
thy
love
is
black
as
ebony
is
ebony
like
her
o
wood
divine
a
wife
of
such
wood
were
felicity
o
who
can
give
an
oath
where
is
a
book
that
i
may
swear
beauty
doth
beauty
lack
if
that
she
learn
not
of
her
eye
to
look
no
face
is
fair
that
is
not
full
so
black
o
paradox
black
is
the
badge
of
hell
the
hue
of
dungeons
and
the
scowl
of
night
and
beautys
crest
becomes
the
heavens
well
devils
soonest
tempt
resembling
spirits
of
light
o
if
in
black
my
ladys
brows
be
deckd
it
mourns
that
painting
and
usurping
hair
should
ravish
doters
with
a
false
aspect
and
therefore
is
she
born
to
make
black
fair
her
favour
turns
the
fashion
of
the
days
for
native
blood
is
counted
painting
now
and
therefore
red
that
would
avoid
dispraise
paints
itself
black
to
imitate
her
brow
to
look
like
her
are
chimneysweepers
black
and
since
her
time
are
colliers
counted
bright
and
ethiops
of
their
sweet
complexion
crack
dark
needs
no
candles
now
for
dark
is
light
your
mistresses
dare
never
come
in
rain
for
fear
their
colours
should
be
washd
away
twere
good
yours
did
for
sir
to
tell
you
plain
ill
find
a
fairer
face
not
washd
today
ill
prove
her
fair
or
talk
till
doomsday
here
no
devil
will
fright
thee
then
so
much
as
she
i
never
knew
man
hold
vile
stuff
so
dear
look
heres
thy
love
my
foot
and
her
face
see
o
if
the
streets
were
paved
with
thine
eyes
her
feet
were
much
too
dainty
for
such
tread
o
vile
then
as
she
goes
what
upward
lies
the
street
should
see
as
she
walkd
over
head
but
what
of
this
are
we
not
all
in
love
nothing
so
sure
and
thereby
all
forsworn
then
leave
this
chat
and
good
berowne
now
prove

by
and
by
disguisd
they
will
be
here
their
herald
is
a
pretty
knavish
page
that
well
by
heart
hath
connd
his
embassage
action
and
accent
did
they
teach
him
there
thus
must
thou
speak
and
thus
thy
body
bear
and
ever
and
anon
they
made
a
doubt
presence
majestical
would
put
him
out
for
quoth
the
king
an
angel
shalt
thou
see
yet
fear
not
thou
but
speak
audaciously
the
boy
replied
an
angel
is
not
evil
i
should
have
feard
her
had
she
been
a
devil
with
that
all
laughd
and
clappd
him
on
the
shoulder
making
the
bold
wag
by
their
praises
bolder
one
rubbd
his
elbow
thus
and
fleerd
and
swore
a
better
speech
was
never
spoke
before
another
with
his
finger
and
his
thumb
cryd
via
we
will
dot
come
what
will
come
the
third
he
caperd
and
cried
all
goes
well
the
fourth
turnd
on
the
toe
and
down
he
fell
with
that
they
all
did
tumble
on
the
ground
with
such
a
zealous
laughter
so
profound
that
in
this
spleen
ridiculous
appears
to
check
their
folly
passions
solemn
tears
but
what
but
what
come
they
to
visit
us
they
do
they
do
and
are
apparelld
thus
like
muscovites
or
russians
as
i
guess
their
purpose
is
to
parle
to
court
and
dance
and
every
one
his
lovefeat
will
advance
unto
his
several
mistress
which
theyll
know
by
favours
several
which
they
did
bestow
and
will
they
so
the
gallants
shall
be
taskd
for
ladies
we
will
every
one
be
maskd
and
not
a
man
of
them
shall
have
the
grace
despite
of
suit
to
see
a
ladys
face
hold
rosaline
this
favour
thou
shalt
wear
and
then
the
king
will
court
thee
for
his
dear
hold
take
thou
this
my
sweet
and
give
me
thine
so
shall
berowne
take
me
for
rosaline
and
change
you
favours
too
so
shall
your
loves
woo
contrary
deceivd
by
these
removes
come
on
then
wear
the
favours
most
in
sight
but
in
this
changing
what
is
your
intent
the
effect
of
my
intent
is
to
cross
theirs
they
do
it
but
in
mocking
merriment
and
mock
for
mock
is
only
my
intent
their
several
counsels
they
unbosom
shall
to
loves
mistook
and
so
be
mockd
withal
upon
the
next
occasion
that
we
meet
with
visages
displayd
to
talk
and
greet
but
shall
we
dance
if
they
desire
us
tot
no
to
the
death
we
will
not
move
a
foot
nor
to
their
pennd
speech
render
we
no
grace
but
while
tis
spoke
each
turn
away
her
face
why
that
contempt
will
kill
the
speakers
heart
and
quite
divorce
his
memory
from
his
part
therefore
i
do
it
and
i
make
no
doubt
the
rest
will
neer
come
in
if
he
be
out
theres
no
such
sport
as
sport
by
sport
oerthrown
to
make
theirs
ours
and
ours
none
but
our
own
so
shall
we
stay
mocking
intended
game
and
they
well
mockd
depart
away
with
shame
the
trumpet
sounds
be
maskd
the
maskers
come
all
hail
the
richest
beauties
on
the
earth
beauties
no
richer
than
rich
taffeta
a
holy
parcel
of
the
fairest
dames
that
ever
turnd
their
backs
to
mortal
views
their
eyes
villain
their
eyes
that
ever
turnd
their
eyes
to
mortal
views
out
true
out
indeed
out
of
your
favours
heavenly
spirits
vouchsafe
not
to
behold
once
to
behold
rogue
once
to
behold
with
your
sunbeamed
eyes
with
your
sunbeamed
eyes
they
will
not
answer
to
that
epithet
you
were
best
call
it
daughterbeamed
eyes
they
do
not
mark
me
and
that
brings
me
out
is
this
your
perfectness
be
gone
you
rogue
what
would
these
strangers
know
their
minds
boyet
if
they
do
speak
our
language
tis
our
will
that
some
plain
man
recount
their
purposes
know
what
they
would
what
would
you
with
the
princess
nothing
but
peace
and
gentle
visitation
what
would
they
say
they
nothing
but
peace
and
gentle
visitation
why
that
they
have
and
bid
them
so
be
gone
she
says
you
have
it
and
you
may
be
gone
say
to
her
we
have
measurd
many
miles
to
tread
a
measure
with
her
on
this
grass
they
say
that
they
have
measurd
many
a
mile
to
tread
a
measure
with
you
on
this
grass
it
is
not
so
ask
them
how
many
inches
is
in
one
mile
if
they
have
measurd
many
the
measure
then
of
one
is
easily
told
if
to
come
hither
you
have
measurd
miles
and
many
miles
the
princess
bids
you
tell
how
many
inches
do
fill
up
one
mile
tell
her
we
measure
them
by
weary
steps
she
hears
herself
how
many
weary
steps
of
many
weary
miles
you
have
oergone
are
numberd
in
the
travel
of
one
mile
we
number
nothing
that
we
spend
for
you
our
duty
is
so
rich
so
infinite
that
we
may
do
it
still
without
accompt
vouchsafe
to
show
the
sunshine
of
your
face
that
we
like
savages
may
worship
it
my
face
is
but
a
moon
and
clouded
too
blessed
are
clouds
to
do
as
such
clouds
do
vouchsafe
bright
moon
and
these
thy
stars
to
shine
those
clouds
removd
upon
our
watry

end
their
shallow

to
our
court
vouchsafe

then
this
field
shall
hold
me
and
so
hold
your
vow
nor

nor
i
delights
in
perjurd
men
rebuke
me
not
for
that
which
you
provoke
the
virtue
of
your
eye
must
break
my
oath
you
nickname
virtue
vice
you
should
have
spoke
for
virtues
office
never
breaks
mens
troth
now
by
my
maiden
honour
yet
as
pure
as
the
unsullied
lily
i
protest
a
world
of
torments
though
i
should
endure
i
would
not
yield
to
be
your
houses
guest
so
much
i
hate
a
breaking
cause
to
be
of
heavenly
oaths
vowd
with
integrity
o
you
have
livd
in
desolation
here
unseen
unvisited
much
to
our
shame
not
so
my
lord
it
is
not
so
i
swear
we
have
had
pastime
here
and
pleasant
game
a
mess
of
russians
left
us
but
of
late
how
madam
russians
ay
in
truth
my
lord
trim
gallants
full
of
courtship
and
of
state
madam
speak
true
it
is
not
so
my
lord
my
lady
to
the
manner
of
the
days
in
courtesy
gives
undeserving
praise
we
four
indeed
confronted
were
with
four
in
russian
habit
here
they
stayd
an
hour
and
talkd
apace
and
in
that
hour
my
lord
they
did
not
bless
us
with
one
happy
word
i
dare
not
call
them
fools
but
this
i
think
when
they
are
thirsty
fools
would
fam
have
drink
this
jest
is
dry
to
me
fair
gentle
sweet
your
wit
makes
wise
things
foolish
when
we
greet
with
eyes
best
seeing
heavens
fiery
eye
by
light
we
lose
light
your
capacity
is
of
that
nature
that
to
your
huge
store
wise
things
seem
foolish
and
rich
things
but
poor
this
proves
you
wise
and
rich
for
in
my
eye
i
am
a
fool
and
full
of
poverty
but
that
you
take
what
doth
to
you
belong
it
were
a
fault
to
snatch
words
from
my
tongue
o
i
am
yours
and
all
that
i
possess
all
the
fool
mine
i
cannot
give
you
less
which
of
the
visors
was
it
that
you
wore
where
when
what
visor
why
demand
you
this
there
then
that
visor
that
superfluous
case
that
hid
the
worse
and
showd
the
better
face
we
are
descried
theyll
mock
us
now
downright
let
us
confess
and
turn
it
to
a
jest
amazd
my
lord
why
looks
your
highness
sad
help
hold
his
brows
hell
swound
why
look
you
pale
seasick
i
think
coming
from
muscovy
thus
pour
the
stars
down
plagues
for
perjury
can
any
face
of
brass
hold
longer
out
here
stand
i
lady
dart
thy
skill
at
me
bruise
me
with
scorn
confound
me
with
a
flout
thrust
thy
sharp
wit
quite
through
my
ignorance
cut
me
to
pieces
with
thy
keen
conceit
and
i
will
wish
thee
never
more
to
dance
nor
never
more
in
russian
habit
wait
o
never
will
i
trust
to
speeches
pennd
nor
to
the
motion
of
a
schoolboys
tongue
nor
never
come
in
visor
to
my
friend
nor
woo
in
rime
like
a
blind
harpers
song
taffeta
phrases
silken
terms
precise
threepild
hyperboles
spruce
affectation
figures
pedantical
these
summer
flies
have
blown
me
full
of
maggot
ostentation
i
do
forswear
them
and
i
here
protest
by
this
white
glove
how
white
the
hand
god
knows
henceforth
my
wooing
mind
shall
be
expressd
in
russet
yeas
and
honest
kersey
noes
and
to
begin
wench
so
god
help
me
la
my
love
to
thee
is
sound
sans
crack
or
flaw
sans
sans
i
pray
you
yet
i
have
a
trick
of
the
old
rage
bear
with
me
i
am
sick
ill
leave
it
by
degrees
soft
let
us
see
write
lord
have
mercy
on
us
on
those
three
they
are
infected
in
their
hearts
it
lies
they
have
the
plague
and
caught
it
of
your
eyes
these
lords
are
visited
you
are
not
free
for
the
lords

some
slight
zany
some
mumblenews
some
trencherknight
some
dick
that
smiles

the
trick
to
make
my

laugh
when

disposd
told
our

before
which
once
disclosd
the

the
naked
truth

is
i

no

i
go
woolward
for
penance
true
and
it
was
enjoined
him
in
rome
for
want
of
linen
since
when
ill
be
sworn
he
wore
none
but
a
dishclout
of
jaquenettas
and
that
a
wears
next
his
heart
for
a
favour
god
save
you
madam
welcome
marcade
but
that
thou
interruptst
our
merriment
i
am
sorry
madam
for
the
news
i
bring
is
heavy
in
my
tongue
the
king
your
father
dead
for
my
life
even
so
my
tale
is
told
worthies
away
the
scene
begins
to
cloud
for
my
own
part
i
breathe
free
breath
i
have
seen
the
day
of
wrong
through
the
little
hole
of
discretion
and
i
will
right
myself
like
a
soldier
how
fares
your
majesty
boyet
prepare
i
will
away
tonight
madam
not
so
i
do
beseech
you
stay
prepare
i
say
i
thank
you
gracious
lords
for
all
your
fair
endeavours
and
entreat
out
of
a
newsad
soul
that
you
vouchsafe
in
your
rich
wisdom
to
excuse
or
hide
the
liberal
opposition
of
our
spirits
if
overboldly
we
have
borne
ourselves
in
the
converse
of
breath
your
gentleness
was
guilty
of
it
farewell
worthy
lord
a
heavy
heart
bears
not
a
nimble
tongue
excuse
me
so
coming
so
short
of
thanks
for
my
great
suit
so
easily
obtaind
the
extreme
part
of
time
extremely
forms
all
causes
to
the
purpose
of
his
speed
and
often
at
his
very
loose
decides
that
which
long
process
could
not
arbitrate
and
though
the
mourning
brow
of
progeny
forbid
the
smiling
courtesy
of
love
the
holy
suit
which
fain
it
would
convince
yet
since
loves
argument
was
first
on
foot
let
not
the
cloud
of
sorrow
justle
it
from
what
it
purposd
since
to
wail
friends
lost
is
not
by
much
so
wholesomeprofitable
as
to
rejoice
at
friends
but
newly
found
i
understand
you
not
my
griefs
are
double
honest
plain
words
best
pierce
the
ear
of
grief
and
by
these
badges
understand
the
king
for
your
fair
sakes
have
we
neglected
time
playd
foul
play
with
our
oaths
your
beauty
ladies
hath
much
deformd
us
fashioning
our
humours
even
to
the
opposed
end
of
our
intents
and
what
in
us
hath
seemd
ridiculous
as
love
is
full
of
unbefitting
strains
all
wanton
as
a
child
skipping
and
vain
formd
by
the
eye
and
therefore
like
the
eye
full
of
stray
shapes
of
habits
and
of
forms
varying
in
subjects
as
the
eye
doth
roll
to
every
varied
object
in
his
glance
which
particoated
presence
of
loose
love
put
on
by
us
if
in
your
heavenly
eyes
have
misbecome
our
oaths
and
gravities
those
heavenly
eyes
that
look
into
these
faults
suggested
us
to
make
therefore
ladies
our
love
being
yours
the
error
that
love
makes
is
likewise
yours
we
to
ourselves
prove
false
by
being
once
false
for
ever
to
be
true
to
those
that
make
us
both
fair
ladies
you
and
even
that
falsehood
in
itself
a
sin
thus
purifies
itself
and
turns
to
grace
we
have
receivd
your
letters
full
of
love
your
favours
the
embassadors
of
love
and
in
our
maiden
council
rated
them
at
courtship
pleasant
jest
and
courtesy
as
bombast
and
as
lining
to
the
time
but
more
devout
than
this
in
our
respects
have
we
not
been
and
therefore
met
your
loves
in
their
own
fashion
like
a
merriment
our
letters
madam
showd
much
more
than
jest
so
did
our
looks
we
did
not
quote
them
so
now
at
the
latest
minute
of
the
hour
grant
us
your
loves
a
time
methinks
too
short
to
make
a
worldwithoutend
bargain
in
no
no
my
lord
your
grace
is
perjurd
much
full
of
dear
guiltiness
and
therefore
this
if
for
my
love
as
there
is
no
such
cause
you
will
do
aught
this
shall
you
do
for
me
your
oath
i
will
not
trust
but
go
with
speed
to
some
forlorn
and
naked
hermitage
remote
from
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
there
stay
until
the
twelve
celestial
signs
have
brought
about
their
annual
reckoning
if
this
austere
insociable
life
change
not
your
offer
made
in
heat
of
blood
if
frosts
and
fasts
hard
lodging
and
thin
weeds
nip
not
the
gaudy
blossoms
of
your
love
but
that
it
bear
this
trial
and
last
love
then
at
the
expiration
of
the
year
come
challenge
me
challenge
me
by
these
deserts
and
by
this
virgin
palm
now
kissing
thine
i
will
be
thine
and
till
that
instant
shut
my
woful
self
up
in
a
mourning
house
raining
the
tears
of
lamentation
for
the
remembrance
of
my
fathers
death
if
this
thou
do
deny
let
our
hands
part
neither
intitled
in
the
others
heart
if
this
or
more
than
this
i
would
deny
to
flatter
up
these
powers
of
mine
with
rest
the
sudden
hand
of
death
close
up
mine
eye
hence
ever
then
my
heart
is
in
thy
breast
and
what
to
me
my
love
and
what
to
me
you
must
be
purged
too
your
sins
are
rackd
you
are
attaint
with
faults
and
perjury
therefore
if
you
my
favour
mean
to
get
a
twelvemonth
shall
you
spend
and
never
rest
but
seek
the
weary
beds
of
people
sick
but
what
to
me
my
love
but
what
to
me
a
wife
a
beard
fair
health
and
honesty
with
threefold
love
i
wish
you
all
these
three
o
shall
i
say
i
thank
you
gentle
wife
not
so
my
lord
a
twelvemonth
and
a
day
ill
mark
no
words
that
smoothfacd
wooers
say
come
when
the
king
doth
to
my
lady
come
then
if
i
have
much
love
ill
give
you
some
ill
serve
thee
true
and
faithfully
till
then
yet
swear
not
lest
you
be
forsworn
again
what
says
maria
at
the
twelvemonths
end
ill
change
my
black
gown
for
a
faithful
friend
ill
stay
with
patience
but
the
time
is
long
the
liker
you
few
taller
are
so
young
studies
my
lady
mistress
look
on
me
behold
the
window
of
my
heart
mine
eye
what
humble
suit
attends
thy
answer
there
impose
some
service
on
me
for
thy
love
oft
have
i
heard
of
you
my
lord
berowne
before
i
saw
you
and
the
worlds
large
tongue
proclaims
you
for
a
man
replete
with
mocks
full
of
comparisons
and
wounding
flouts
which
you
on
all
estates
will
execute
that
lie
within
the
mercy
of
your
wit
to
weed
this
wormwood
from
your
fruitful
brain
and
therewithal
to
win
me
if
you
please
without
the
which
i
am
not
to
be
won
you
shall
this
twelvemonth
term
from
day
to
day
visit
the
speechless
sick
and
still
converse
with
groaning
wretches
and
your
task
shall
be
with
all
the
fierce
endeavour
of
your
wit
to
enforce
the
pained
impotent
to
smile
to
move
wild
laughter
in
the
throat
of
death
it
cannot
be
it
is
impossible
mirth
cannot
move
a
soul
in
agony
why
thats
the
way
to
choke
a
gibing
spirit
whose
influence
is
begot
of
that
loose
grace
which
shallow
laughing
hearers
give
to
fools
a
jests
prosperity
lics
in
the
ear
of
him
that
hears
it
never
in
the
tongue
of
him
that
makes
it
then
if
sickly
ears
deafd
with
the
clamours
of
their
own
dear
groans
will
hear
your
idle
scorns
continue
them
and
i
will
have
you
and
that
fault
withal
but
if
they
will
not
throw
away
that
spirit
and
i
shall
find
you
empty
of
that
fault
right
joyful
of
your
reformation
a
twelvemonth
well
befall
what
will
befall
ill
jest

twelvemonth

a
hospital

the
dialogue

escalus
my
lord
of
government
the
properties
to
unfold
would
seem
in
me
to
affect
speech
and
discourse
since
i
am
put
to
know
that
your
own
science
exceeds
in
that
the
lists
of
all
advice
my
strength
can
give
you
then
no
more
remains
but
that
to
your
sufficiency
as
your
worth
is
able
and
let
them
work
the
nature
of
our
people
our
citys
institutions
and
the
terms
for
common
justice
youre
as
pregnant
in
as
art
and
practice
hath
enriched
any
that
we
remember
there
is
our
commission
from
which
we
would
not
have
you
warp
call
hither
i
say
bid
come
before
us
angelo
what
figure
of
us
think
you
he
will
bear
for
you
must
know
we
have
with
special
soul
elected
him
our
absence
to
supply
lent
him
our
terror
drest
him
with
our
love
and
given
his
deputation
all
the
organs
of
our
own
power
what
think
you
of
it
if
any
in
vienna
be
of
worth
to
undergo
such
ample
grace
and
honour
it
is
lord
angelo
look
where
he
comes
always
obedient
to
your
graces
will
i
come
to
know
your
pleasure
angelo
there
is
a
kind
of
character
in
thy
life
that
to
th
observer
doth
thy
history
fully
unfold
thyself
and
thy
belongings
are
not
thine
own
so
proper
as
to
waste
thyself
upon
thy
virtues
they
on
thee
heaven
doth
with
us
as
we
with
torches
do
not
light
them
for
themselves
for
if
our
virtues
did
not
go
forth
of
us
twere
all
alike
as
if
we
had
them
not
spirits
are
not
finely
touchd
but
to
fine
issues
nor
nature
never
lends
the
smallest
scruple
of
her
excellence
but
like
a
thrifty
goddess
she
determines
herself
the
glory
of
a
creditor
both
thanks
and
use
but
i
do
bend
my
speech
to
one
that
can
my
part
in
him
advertise
hold
therefore
angelo
in
our
remove
be
thou
at
full
ourself
mortality
and
mercy
in
vienna
live
in
thy
tongue
and
heart
old
escalus
though
first
in
question
is
thy
secondary
take
thy
commission
now
good
my
lord
let
there
be
some
more
test
made
of
my
metal
before
so
noble
and
so
great
a
figure
be
stampd
upon
it
no
more
evasion
we
have
with
a
leavend
and
prepared
choice
proceeded
to
you
therefore
take
your
honours
our
haste
from
hence
is
of
so
quick
condition
that
it
prefers
itself
and
leaves
unquestiond
matters
of
needful
value
we
shall
write
to
you
as
time
and
our
concernings
shall
importune
how
it
goes
with
us
and
do
look
to
know
what
doth
befall
you
here
so
fare
you
well
to
the
hopeful
execution
do
i
leave
you
of
your
commissions
yet
give
leave
my
lord
that
we
may
bring
you
something
on
the
way
my
haste
may
not
admit
it
nor
need
you
on
mine
honour
have
to
do
with
any
scruple
your
scope
is
as
mine
own
so
to
enforce
or
qualify
the
laws
as
to
your
soul
seems
good
give
me
your
hand
ill
privily
away
i
love
the
people
but
do
not
like
to
stage
me
to
their
eyes
though
it
do
well
i
do
not
relish
well
their
loud
applause
and
aves
vehement
nor
do
i
think
the
man
of
safe
discretion
that
does
affect
it
once
more
fare
you
well
the
heavens
give
safety
to
your
purposes
lead
forth
and
bring
you
back
in
happiness
i
thank
you
fare
you
well
i
shall
desire
you
sir
to
give
me
leave
to
have
free
speech
with
you
and
it
concerns
me
to
look
into
the
bottom
of
my
place
a
power
i
have
but
of
what
strength
and
nature
i
am
not
yet
instructed
tis
so
with
me
let
us
withdraw
together
and
we
may
soon
our
satisfaction
have
touching
that
point
ill
wait
upon
your
honour
if
the
duke
with
the
other
dukes
come
not
to
composition
with
the
king
of
hungary
why
then
all
the
dukes
fall
upon
the
king
heaven
grant
us
its
peace
but
not
the
king
of
hungarys
amen
thou
concludest
like
the
sanctimonious
pirate
that
went
to
sea
with
the
ten
commandments
but
scraped
one
out
of
the
table
thou
shalt
not
steal
ay
that
he
razed
why
twas
a
commandment
to
command
the
captain
and
all
the
rest
from
their
functions
they
put
forth
to
steal
theres
not
a
soldier
of
us
all
that
in
the
thanksgiving
before
meat
doth
relish
the
petition
well
that
prays
for
peace
i
never
heard
any
soldier
dislike
it
i
believe
thee
for
i
think
thou
never
wast
where
grace
was
said
no
a
dozen
times
at
least
what
in
metre
in
any
proportion
or
in
any
language
i
think
or
in
any
religion
ay
why
not
grace
is
grace
despite
of
all
controversy
as
for
example
thou
thyself
art
a
wicked
villain
despite
of
all
grace
well
there
went
but
a
pair
of
shears
between
us
i
grant
as
there
may
between
the
lists
and
the
velvet
thou
art
the
list
and
thou
the
velvet
thou
art
good
velvet
thou
art
a
threepiled
piece
i
warrant
thee
i
had
as
lief
be
a
list
of
an
english
kersey
as
be
piled
as
thou
art
piled
for
a
french
velvet
do
i
speak
feelingly
now
i
think
thou
dost
and
indeed
with
most
painful
feeling
of
thy
speech
i
will
out
of
thine
own
confession
learn
to
begin
thy
health
but
whilst
i
live
forget
to
drink
after
thee
i
think
i
have
done
myself
wrong
have
i
not
yes
that
thou
hast
whether
thou
art
tainted
or
free
behold
behold
where
madam
mitigation
comes
i
have
purchased
as
many
diseases
under
her
roof
as
come
to
to
what
i
pray
judge
to
three
thousand
dolours
a
year
ay
and
more
a
french
crown
more
thou
art
always
figuring
diseases
in
me
but
thou
art
full
of
error
i
am
sound
nay
not
as
one
would
say
healthy
but
so
sound
as
things
that
are
hollow
thy
bones
are
hollow
impiety
has
made
a
feast
of
thee
how
now
which
of
your
hips

the
most
profound
sciatica
well
well

which

more
within

three
days
his
head

after
all
this
fooling

sure
of
this
i
am
too
sure
of
it
and
it
is
for
getting
madam
julietta
with
child
believe
me
this
may
be
he
promised
to
meet
me
two
hours
since
and
he
was
ever
precise
in
promisekeeping
besides
you
know
it
draws
something
near
to
the
speech
we
had
to
such
a
purpose
but
most
of
all
agreeing
with
the
proclamation
away
lets
go
learn
the
truth
of
it
thus
what
with
the
war
what
with
the
sweat
what
with
the
gallows
and
what
with
poverty
i
am
customshrunk
how
now
whats
the
news
with
you
yonder
man
is
carried
to
prison
well
what
has
he
done
a
woman
but
whats
his
offence
groping
for
trouts
in
a
peculiar
river
what
is
there
a
maid
with
child
by
him
no
but
theres
a
woman
with
maid
by
him
you
have
not
heard
of
the
proclamation
have
you
what
proclamation
man
all
houses
of
resort
in
the
suburbs
of
vienna
must
be
plucked
down
and
what
shall
become
of
those
in
the
city
they
shall
stand
for
seed
they
had
gone
down
too
but
that
a
wise
burgher
put
in
for
them
but
shall
all
our
houses
of
resort
in
the
suburbs
be
pulled
down
to
the
ground
mistress
why
heres
a
change
indeed
in
the
commonwealth
what
shall
become
of
me
come
fear
not
you
good
counsellors
lack
no
clients
though
you
change
your
place
you
need
not
change
your
trade
ill
be
your
tapster
still
courage
there
will
be
pity
taken
on
you
you
that
have
worn
your
eyes
almost
out
in
the
service
you
will
be
considered
whats
to
do
here
thomas
tapster
lets
withdraw
here
comes
signior
claudio
led
by
the
provost
to
prison
and
theres
madam
juliet
fellow
why
dost
thou
show
me
thus
to
the
world
bear
me
to
prison
where
i
am
committed
i
do
it
not
in
evil
disposition
but
from
lord
angelo
by
special
charge
thus
can
the
demigod
authority
make
us
pay
down
for
our
offence
by
weight
the
words
of
heaven
on
whom
it
will
it
will
on
whom
it
will
not
so
yet
still
tis
just
why
how
now
claudio
whence
comes
this
restraint
from
too
much
liberty
my
lucio
liberty
as
surfeit
is
the
father
of
much
fast
so
every
scope
by
the
immoderate
use
turns
to
restraint
our
natures
do
pursue
like
rats
that
ravin
down
their
proper
bane
a
thirsty
evil
and
when
we
drink
we
die
if
i
could
speak
so
wisely
under
an
arrest
i
would
send
for
certain
of
my
creditors
and
yet
to
say
the
truth
i
had
as
lief
have
the
foppery
of
freedom
as
the
morality
of
imprisonment
whats
thy
offence
claudio
what
but
to
speak
of
would
offend
again
what
ist
murder
no
lechery
call
it
so
away
sir
you
must
go
one
word
good
friend
lucio
a
word
with
you
a
hundred
if
theyll
do
you
any
good
is
lechery
so
looked
after
thus
stands
it
with
me
upon
a
true
contract
i
got
possession
of
juliettas
bed
you
know
the
lady
she
is
fast
my
wife
save
that
we
do
the
denunciation
lack
of
outward
order
this
we
came
not
to
only
for
propagation
of
a
dower
remaining
in
the
coffer
of
her
friends
from
whom
we
thought
it
meet
to
hide
our
love
till
time
had
made
them
for
us
but
it
chances
the
stealth
of
our
most
mutual
entertainment
with
character
too
gross
is
writ
on
juliet
with
child
perhaps
unhappily
even
so
and
the
new
deputy
now
for
the
duke
whether
it
be
the
fault
and
glimpse
of
newness
or
whether
that
the
body
public
be
a
horse
whereon
the
governor
doth
ride
who
newly
in
the
seat
that
it
may
know
he
can
command
lets
it
straight
feel
the
spur
whether
the
tyranny
be
in
his
place
or
in
his
eminence
that
fills
it
up
i
stagger
in
but
this
new
governor
awakes
me
all
the
enrolled
penalties
which
have
like
unscourd
armour
hung
by
the
wall
so
long
that
nineteen
zodiacs
have
gone
round
and
none
of
them
been
worn
and
for
a
name
now
puts
the
drowsy
and
neglected
act
freshly
on
me
tis
surely
for
a
name
i
warrant
it
is
and
thy
head
stands
so
tickle
on
thy
shoulders
that
a
milkmaid
if
she
be
in
love
may
sigh
it
off
send
after
the
duke
and
appeal
to
him
i
have
done
so
but
hes
not
to
be
found
i
prithee
lucio
do
me
this
kind
service
this
day
my
sister
should
the
cloister
enter
and
there
receive
her
approbation
acquaint
her
with
the
danger
of
my
state
implore
her
in
my
voice
that
she
make
friends
to
the
strict
deputy
bid
herself
assay
him
i
have
great
hope
in
that
for
in
her
youth
there
is
a
prone
and
speechless
dialect
such
as
move
men
beside
she
hath
prosperous
art
when
she
will
play
with
reason
and
discourse
and
well
she
can
persuade
i
pray
she
may
as
well
for
the
encouragement
of
the
like
which
else
would
stand
under
grievous
imposition
as
for
the
enjoying
of
thy
life
who
i
would
be
sorry
should
be
thus
foolishly
lost
at
a
game
of
ticktack
ill
to
her
i
thank
you
good
friend
lucio
within
two
hours
come
officer
away
no
holy
father
throw
away
that
thought
believe
not
that
the
dribbling
dart
of
love
can
pierce
a
complete
bosom
why
i
desire
thee
to
give
me
secret
harbour
hath
a
purpose
more
grave
and
wrinkled
than
the
aims
and
ends
of
burning
youth
may
your
grace
speak
of
it
my
holy
sir
none
better
knows
than
you
how
i
have
ever
lovd
the
life
removd
and
held
in
idle
price
to
haunt
assemblies
where
youth
and
cost
and
witless
bravery
keeps
i
have
deliverd
to
lord
angelo
a
man
of
stricture
and
firm
abstinence
my
absolute
power
and
place
here
in
vienna
and
he
supposes
me
travelld
to
poland
for
so
i
have
strewd
it
in
the
common
ear
and
so
it
is
receivd
now
pious
sir
you
will
demand
of
me
why
i
do
this
gladly
my
lord
we
have
strict
statutes
and
most
biting
laws
the
needful
bits
and
curbs
to
headstrong
steeds
which
for
this
fourteen
years
we
have
let
sleep
even
like
an
oergrown
lion
in
a
cave
that
goes
not
out
to
prey
now
as
fond
fathers
having
bound
up
the
threatning
twigs
of
birch
only
to
stick
it
in
their
childrens
sight
for
terror
not
to
use
in
time
the
rod
becomes
more
mockd
than
feard
so
our
decrees
dead
to
infliction
to
themselves
are
dead
and
liberty
plucks
justice
by
the
nose
the
baby
beats
the
nurse
and
quite
athwart
goes
all
decorum
it
rested
in
your
grace
t
unloose
this
tiedup
justice
when
you
pleasd
and
it
in
you
more
dreadful
would
have
seemd
than
in
lord
angelo
i
do
fear
too
dreadful
sith
twas
my
fault
to
give
the
people
scope
twould
be
my
tyranny
to
strike
and
gall
them
for
what
i
bid
them
do
for
we
bid
this
be
done
when
evil
deeds
have
their
permissive
pass
and
not
the
punishment
therefore
indeed
my
father
i
have
on
angelo
imposd
the
office
who
may
in
the
ambush
of
my
name
strike
home
and
yet
my
nature
never
in
the
sight
to
do
it
slander
and
to
behold
his
sway
i
will
as
twere
a
brother
of
your
order
visit
both
prince
and
people
therefore
i
prithee
supply
me
with
the
habit
and
instruct
me
how
i
may
formally
in
person
bear
me
like
a
true
friar
moe
reasons
for
this
action
at
our
more
leisure
shall
i
render
you
only
this
one
lord
angelo
is
precise
stands
at
a
guard
with
envy
scarce
confesses
that
his
blood
flows
or
that
his
appetite
is
more
to
bread
than
stone
hence
shall
we
see
if
power
change
purpose
what
our
seemers
be
and
have
you
nuns
no
further
privileges
are
not
these
large
enough
yes
truly
i
speak
not
as
desiring
more
but
rather
wishing
a
more
strict
restraint
upon
the
sisterhood
the
votarists
of
saint
clare
ho
peace
be
in
this
place
whos
that
which

then
if
you
speak

must
not
show

so
stead
me
as

me
to
the
sight
of
isabella
a
novice
of
this
place
and
the
fair
sister
to
her
unhappy
brother
claudio
why
her
unhappy
brother
let
me
ask
the
rather
for
i

sister
gentle
and
fair
your
brother

in
prison
woe

for
what
for
that
which

myself
might
be
his
judge
he
should
receive
his
punishment
in
thanks
he
hath
got
his
friend
with
child
sir
make
me
not
your
story
it
is
true
i
would
not
though
tis
my
familiar
sin
with
maids
to
seem
the
lapwing
and
to
jest
tongue
far
from
heart
play
with
all
virgins
so
i
hold
you
as
a
thing
enskyd
and
sainted
by
your
renouncement
an
immortal
spirit
and
to
be
talkd
with
in
sincerity
as
with
a
saint
you
do
blaspheme
the
good
in
mocking
me
do
not
believe
it
fewness
and
truth
tis
thus
your
brother
and
his
lover
have
embracd
as
those
that
feed
grow
full
as
blossoming
time
that
from
the
seedness
the
bare
fallow
brings
to
teeming
foison
even
so
her
plenteous
womb
expresseth
his
full
tilth
and
husbandry
some
one
with
child
by
him
my
cousin
juliet
is
she
your
cousin
adoptedly
asschoolmaids
change
their
names
by
vain
though
apt
affection
she
it
is
o
let
him
marry
her
this
is
the
point
the
duke
is
very
strangely
gone
from
hence
bore
many
gentlemen
myself
being
one
in
hand
and
hope
of
action
but
we
do
learn
by
those
that
know
the
very
nerves
of
state
his
givings
out
were
of
an
infinite
distance
from
his
truemeant
design
upon
his
place
and
with
full
line
of
his
authority
governs
lord
angelo
a
man
whose
blood
is
very
snowbroth
one
who
never
feels
the
wanton
stings
and
motions
of
the
sense
but
doth
rebate
and
blunt
his
natural
edge
with
profits
of
the
mind
study
and
fast
he
to
give
fear
to
use
and
liberty
which
have
for
long
run
by
the
hideous
law
as
mice
by
lions
hath
pickd
out
an
act
under
whose
heavy
sense
your
brothers
life
falls
into
forfeit
he
arrests
him
on
it
and
follows
close
the
rigour
of
the
statute
to
make
him
an
example
all
hope
is
gone
unless
you
have
the
grace
by
your
fair
prayer
to
soften
angelo
and
thats
my
pith
of
business
twixt
you
and
your
poor
brother
doth
he
so
seek
his
life
hes
censurd
him
already
and
as
i
hear
the
provost
hath
a
warrant
for
his
execution
alas
what
poor
abilitys
in
me
to
do
him
good
assay
the
power
you
have
my
power
alas
i
doubt
our
doubts
are
traitors
and
make
us
lose
the
good
we
oft
might
win
by
fearing
to
attempt
go
to
lord
angelo
and
let
him
learn
to
know
when
maidens
sue
men
give
like
gods
but
when
they
weep
and
kneel
all
their
petitions
are
as
freely
theirs
as
they
themselves
would
owe
them
ill
see
what
i
can
do
but
speedily
i
will
about
it
straight
no
longer
staying
but
to
give
the
mother
notice
of
my
affair
i
humbly
thank
you
commend
me
to
my
brother
soon
at
night
ill
send
him
certain
word
of
my
success
i
take
my
leave
of
you
good
sir
adieu
we
must
not
make
a
scarecrow
of
the
law
setting
it
up
to
fear
the
birds
of
prey
and
let
it
keep
one
shape
till
custom
make
it
their
perch
and
not
their
terror
ay
but
yet
let
us
be
keen
and
rather
cut
a
little
than
fall
and
bruise
to
death
alas
this
gentleman
whom
i
would
save
had
a
most
noble
father
let
but
your
honour
know
whom
i
believe
to
be
most
strait
in
virtue
that
in
the
working
of
your
own
affections
had
time
coherd
with
place
or
place
with
wishing
or
that
the
resolute
acting
of
your
blood
could
have
attaind
the
effect
of
your
own
purpose
whether
you
had
not
some
time
in
your
life
errd
in
this
point
which
now
you
censure
him
and
pulld
the
law
upon
you
tis
one
thing
to
be
tempted
escalus
another
thing
to
fall
i
not
deny
the
jury
passing
on
the
prisoners
life
may
in
the
sworn
twelve
have
a
thief
or
two
guiltier
than
him
they
try
whats
open
made
to
justice
that
justice
seizes
what
know
the
laws
that
thieves
do
pass
on
thieves
tis
very
pregnant
the
jewel
that
we
find
we
stoop
and
take
it
because
we
see
it
but
what
we
do
not
see
we
tread
upon
and
never
think
of
it
you
may
not
so
extenuate
his
offence
for
i
have
had
such
faults
but
rather
tell
me
when
i
that
censure
him
do
so
offend
let
mine
own
judgment
pattern
out
my
death
and
nothing
come
in
partial

must
die

wisdom

utmost
of
his
pilgrimage

rise
by
sin
and

by
virtue

ice

condemned
for
a
fault

but
can
you

cannot
do
but
might
you
dot

a
forfeit
of
the
law
and
you
but
waste
your
words
alas

why
all
the
souls
that

were
forfeit
once
and
he
that

the
vantage
best
have
took
found
out
the
remedy
how
would
you
be
if
he
which
is
the
top
of
judgment
should
but
judge
you
as

him
hes
not
prepard
for
death
even
for
our
kitchens
we
kill
the
fowl
of
season
shall
we
serve
heaven
with
less
respect
than
we
do
minister
to
our
gross
selves
good
good
my
lord
bethink
you
who
is
it
that
hath
died
for
this
offence
theres
many
have
committed
it
ay
well
said
the
law
hath
not
been
dead
though
it
hath
slept
those
many
had
not
dard
to
do
that
evil
if
that
the
first
that
did
th
edict
infringe
had
answerd
for
his
deed
now
tis
awake
takes
note
of
what
is
done
and
like
a
prophet
looks
in
a
glass
that
shows
what
future
evils
either
new
or
by
remissness
newconceivd
and
so
in
progress
to
be
hatchd
and
born
are
now
to
have
no
successive
degrees
but
ere
they
live
to
end
yet
show
some
pity
i
show
it
most
of
all
when
i
show
justice
for
then
i
pity
those
i
do
not
know
which
a
dismissd
offence
would
after
gall
and
do
him
right
that
answering
one
foul
wrong
lives
not
to
act
another
be
satisfied
your
brother
dies
tomorrow
be
content
so
you
must
be
the
first
that
gives
this
sentence
and
he
that
suffers
o
it
is
excellent
to
have
a
giants
strength
but
it
is
tyrannous
to
use
it
like
a
giant
thats
well
said
could
great
men
thunder
as
jove
himself
does
jove
would
neer
be
quiet
for
every
pelting
petty
officer
would
use
his
heaven
for
thunder
nothing
but
thunder
merciful
heaven
thou
rather
with
thy
sharp
and
sulphurous
bolt
splitst
the
unwedgeable
and
gnarled
oak
than
the
soft
myrtle
but
man
proud
man
drest
in
a
little
brief
authority
most
ignorant
of
what
hes
most
assurd
his
glassy
essence
like
an
angry
ape
plays
such
fantastic
tricks
before
high
heaven
as
make
the
angels
weep
who
with
our
spleens
would
all
themselves
laugh
mortal
o
to
him
to
him
wench
he
will
relent
hes
coming
i
perceivet
pray
heaven
she
win
him
we
cannot
weigh
our
brother
with
ourself
great
men
may
jest
with
saints
tis
wit
in
them
but
in
the
less
foul
profanation
thourt
in
the
right
girl
more
o
that
that
in
the
captains
but
a
choleric
word
which
in
the
soldier
is
flat
blasphemy
art
advisd
o
that
more
on
t
why
do
you
put
these
sayings
upon
me
because
authority
though
it
err
like
others
hath
yet
a
kind
of
medicine
in
itself
that
skins
the
vice
o
the
top
go
to
your
bosom
knock
there
and
ask
your
heart
what
it
doth
know
thats
like
my
brothers
fault
if
it
confess
a
natural
guiltiness
such
as
is
his
let
it
not
sound
a
thought
upon
your
tongue
against
my
brothers
life
she
speaks
and
tis
such
sense
that
my
sense
breeds
with
it
fare
you
well
gentle
my
lord
turn
back
i
will
bethink
me
come
again
tomorrow
hark
how
ill
bribe
you
good
my
lord
turn
back
how
bribe
me
ay
with
such
gifts
that
heaven
shall
share
with
you
you
had
marrd
all
else
not
with
fond
sicles
of
the
tested
gold
or
stones
whose
rates
are
either
rich
or
poor
as
fancy
values
them
but
with
true
prayers
that
shall
be
up
at
heaven
and
enter
there
ere
sunrise
prayers
from
preserved
souls
from
fasting
maids
whose
minds
are
dedicate
to
nothing
temporal
well
come
to
me
tomorrow
go
to
tis
well
away
heaven
keep
your
honour
safe
amen
for
i
am
that
way
going
to
temptation
where
prayers
cross
at
what
hour
tomorrow
shall
i
attend
your
lordship
at
any
time
fore
noon
save
your
honour
from
thee
even
from
thy
virtue
whats
this
whats
this
is
this
her
fault
or
mine
the
tempter
or
the
tempted
who
sins
most
ha
not
she
nor
doth
she
tempt
but
it
is
i
that
lying
by
the
violet
in
the
sun
do
as
the
carrion
does
not
as
the
flower
corrupt
with
virtuous
season
can
it
be
that
modesty
may
more
betray
our
sense
than
womans
lightness
having
waste
ground
enough
shall
we
desire
to
raze
the
sanctuary
and
pitch
our
evils
there
o
fie
fie
fie
what
dost
thou
or
what
art
thou
angelo
dost
thou
desire
her
foully
for
those
things
that
make
her
good
o
let
her
brother
live
thieves
for
their
robbery
have
authority
when
judges
steal
themselves
what
do
i
love
her
that
i
desire
to
hear
her
speak
again
and
feast
upon
her
eyes
what
ist
i
dream
on
o
cunning
enemy
that
to
catch
a
saint
with
saints
dost
bait
thy
hook
most
dangerous
is
that
temptation
that
doth
goad
us
on
to
sin
in
loving
virtue
never
could
the
strumpet
with
all
her
double
vigour
art
and
nature
once
stir
my
temper
but
this
virtuous
maid
subdues
me
quite
ever
till
now
when
men
were
fond
i
smild
and
wonderd
how

my
charity
and

come
to
visit
the
afflicted
spirits
here
in
the
prison
do
me
the
common
right
to
let
me
see
them
and
to
make
me
know
the
nature
of
their
crimes
that
i
may
minister
to
them
accordingly
i
would
do
more
than
that
if
more
were
needful
look
here
comes
one
a
gentlewoman
of
mine
who
falling
in
the
flaws
of
her
own
youth
hath
blisterd
her
report
she
is
with
child
and
he
that
got
it
sentencd
a
young
man
more
fit
to
do
another
such
offence
than
die
for
this
when
must
he
die
as
i
do
think
tomorrow

have
provided
for
you

a
while
and

your
conscience
and
try
your
penitence
if
it
be
sound
or
hollowly
put
on
ill
gladly
learn
love
you
the
man
that
wrongd
you
yes
as
i
love
the
woman
that
wrongd
him
so
then
it
seems
your
most
offenceful
act
was
mutually
committed
mutually
then
was
your
sin
of
heavier
kind
than
his
i
do
confess
it
and
repent
it
father
tis
meet
so
daughter
but
lest
you
do
repent
as
that
the
sin
hath
brought
you
to
this
shame
which
sorrow
is
always
toward
ourselves
not
heaven
showing
we
would
not
spare
heaven
as
we
love
it
but
as
we
stand
in
fear
i
do
repent
me
as
it
is
an
evil
and
take
the
shame
with
joy
there
rest
your
partner
as
i
hear
must
die
tomorrow
and
i
am
going
with
instruction
to
him
gods
grace
go
with
you
benedicite
must
die
tomorrow
o
injurious
love
that
respites
me
a
life
whose
very
comfort
is
still
a
dying
horror
tis
pity
of
him
when
i
would
pray
and
think
i
think
and
pray
to
several
subjects
heaven
hath
my
empty
words
whilst
my
invention
hearing
not
my
tongue
anchors
on
isabel
heaven
in
my
mouth
as
if
i
did
but
only
chew
his
name
and
in
my
heart
the
strong
and
swelling
evil
of
my
conception
the
state
whereon
i
studied
is
like
a
good
thing
being
often
read
grown
feard
and
tedious
yea
my
gravity
wherein
let
no
man
hear
me
i
take
pride
could
i
with
boot
change
for
an
idle
plume
which
the
air
beats
for
vain
o
place
o
form
how
often
dost
thou
with
thy
case
thy
habit
wrench
awe
from
fools
and
tie
the
wiser
souls
to
thy
false
seeming
blood
thou
art
blood
lets
write
good
angel
on
the
devils
horn
tis
not
the
devils
crest
how
now
whos
there
one
isabel
a
sister
desires
access
to
you
teach
her
the
way
o
heavens
why
does
my
blood
thus
muster
to
my
heart
making
both
it
unable
for
itself
and
dispossessing
all
my
other
parts
of
necessary
fitness
so
play
the
foolish
throngs
with
one
that
swounds
come
all
to
help
him
and
so
stop
the
air
by
which
he
should
revive
and
even
so
the
general
subject
to
a
wellwishd
king
quit
their
own
part
and
in
obsequious
fondness
crowd
to
his
presence
where
their
untaught
love
must
needs
appear
offence
how
now
fair
maid
i
am
come
to
know
your
pleasure
that
you
might
know
it
would
much
better
please
me
than
to
demand
what
tis
your
brother
cannot
live
even
so
heaven
keep
your
honour
yet
may
he
live
awhile
and
it
may
be
as
long
as
you
or
i
yet
he
must
die
under
your
sentence
yea
when
i
beseech
you
that
in
his
reprieve
longer
or
shorter
he
may
be
so
fitted
that
his
soul
sicken
not
ha
fie
these
filthy
vices
it
were
as
good
to
pardon
him
that
hath
from
nature
stolen
a
man
already
made
as
to
remit
their
saucy
sweetness
that
do
coin
heavens
image
in
stamps
that
are
forbid
tis
all
as
easy
falsely
to
take
away
a
life
true
made
as
to
put
metal
in
restrained
means
to
make
a
false
one
tis
set
down
so
in
heaven
but
not
in
earth
say
you
so
then
i
shall
pose
you
quickly
which
had
you
rather
that
the
most
just
law
now
took
your
brothers
life
or
to
redeem
him
give
up
your
body
to
such
sweet
uncleanness
as
she
that
he
hath
staind
sir
believe
this
i
had
rather
give
my
body
than
my
soul
i
talk
not
of
your
soul
our
compelld
sins
stand
more
for
number
than
for
accompt
how
say
you
nay
ill
not
warrant
that
for
i
can
speak
against
the
thing
i
say
answer
to
this
i
now
the
voice
of
the
recorded
law
pronounce
a
sentence
on
your
brothers
life
might
there
not
be
a
charity
in
sin
to
save
this
brothers
life
please
you
to
dot
ill
take
it
as
a
peril
to
my
soul
it
is
no
sin
at
all
but
charity
pleasd
you
to
dot
at
peril
of
your
soul
were
equal
poise
of
sin
and
charity
that
i
do
beg
his
life
if
it
be
sin
heaven
let
me
bear
it
you
granting
of
my
suit
if
that
be
sin
ill
make
it
my
morn
prayer
to
have
it
added
to
the
faults
of
mine
and
nothing
of
your
answer
nay
but
hear
me
your
sense
pursues
not
mine
either
you
are
ignorant
or
seem
so
craftily
and
thats
not
good
let
me
be
ignorant
and
in
nothing
good
but
graciously
to
know
i
am
no
better
thus
wisdom
wishes
to
appear
most
bright
when
it
doth
tax
itself
as
these
black
masks
proclaim
an
enshield
beauty
ten
times
louder
than
beauty
could
displayd
but
mark
me
to
be
received
plain
ill
speak
more
gross
your
brother
is
to
die
so
and
his
offence
is
so
as
it
appears
accountant
to
the
law
upon
that
pain
true
admit
no
other
way
to
save
his
life
as
i
subscribe
not
that
nor
any
other
but
in
the
loss
of
question
that
you
his
sister
finding
yourself
desird
of
such
a
person
whose
credit
with
the
judge
or
own
great
place
could
fetch
your
brother
from
the
manacles
of
the
allbuilding
law
and
that
there
were
no
earthly
mean
to
save
him
but
that
either
you
must
lay
down
the
treasures
of
your
body
to
this
supposd
or
else
to
let
him
suffer
what
would
you
do
as
much
for
my
poor
brother
as
myself
that
is
were
i
under
the
terms
of
death
th
impression
of
keen
whips
id
wear
as
rubies
and
strip
myself
to
death
as
to
a
bed
that
longing
have
been
sick
for
ere
id
yield
my
body
up
to
shame
then
must
your
brother
die
and
twere
the
cheaper
way
better
it
were
a
brother
died
at
once
than
that
a
sister
by
redeeming
him
should
die
for
ever
were
not
you
then
as
cruel
as
the
sentence
that
you
have
slanderd
so
ignomy
in
ransom
and
free
pardon
are
of
two
houses
lawful
mercy
is
nothing
kin
to
foul
redemption
you
seemd
of
late
to
make
the
law
a
tyrant
and
rather
provd
the
sliding
of
your
brother
a
merriment
than
a
vice
o
pardon
me
my
lord
it
oft
falls
out
to
have
what
we
would
have
we
speak
not
what
we
mean
i
something
do
excuse
the
thing
i
hate
for
his
advantage
that
i
dearly
love
we
are
all
frail
else
let
my
brother
die
if
not
a
feodary
but
only
he
owe
and
succeed
thy
weakness
nay
women
are
frail
too
ay
as
the
glasses
where
they
view
themselves
which
are
as
easy
broke
as
they
make
forms
women
help
heaven
men
their
creation
mar
in
profiting
by
them
nay
call
us
ten
times
frail
for
we
are
soft
as
our
complexions
are
and
credulous
to
false
prints
i
think
it
well
and
from
this
testimony
of
your
own
sex
since
i
suppose
we
are
made
to
be
no
stronger
than
faults
may
shake
our
frames
let
me
be
bold
i
do
arrest
your
words
be
that
you
are
that
is
a
woman
if
you
be
more
youre
none
if
you
be
one
as
you
are
well
expressd
by
all
external
warrants
show
it
now
by
putting
on
the
destind
livery
i
have
no
tongue
but
one
gentle

lord

me
entreat
you

the
former
language

and
you
tell
me
that
he
shall
die
fort

shall
not
isabel
if
you
give
me
love
i
know
your
virtue
hath
a
licence
int
which
seems
a
little
fouler
than
it
is
to
pluck
on
others
believe
me
on
mine
honour
my
words
express
my
purpose
ha
little
honour
to
be
much
believd
and
most
pernicious
purpose
seeming

i
will
proclaim
thee
angelo
look

sign
me
a
present
pardon
for
my
brother
or
with
an
outstretchd
throat
ill

isabel
my
unsoild
name
the
austereness
of
my
life
my
vouch
against
you
and
my
place
i
the
state
will
so
your
accusation
overweigh
that
you
shall
stifle
in
your
own
report
and
smell
of
calumny
i
have
begun
and
now
i
give
my
sensual
race
the
rein
fit
thy
consent

my
sharp
appetite

by
all
nicety
and
prolixious

up
thy

death

thy
unkindness

his
death
draw
out
to
lingering
sufferance

to

o
perilous
mouths
that
bear
in
them
one
and
the
selfsame
tongue
either
of
condemnation
or
approof
bidding
the
law
make
curtsy
to
their
will
hooking
both
right
and
wrong
to
th
appetite
to
follow
as
it
draws
ill
to
my
brother
though
he
hath
fallen
by
prompture
of
the
blood
yet
hath
he
in
him
such
a
mind
of
honour
that
had
he
twenty
heads
to
tender
down
on
twenty
bloody
blocks
hed
yield
them
up
before
his
sister
should
her
body
stoop
to
such
abhorrd
pollution
then
isabel
live
chaste
and

die
more
than
our
brother
is
our
chastity
ill
tell
him
yet
of
angelos
request
and
fit
his
mind
to
death
for
his
souls

only
hope
i
have
hope
to
live
and
am
prepard
to

sweeter
reason
thus
with
life
if
i
do
lose
thee
i
do
lose
a
thing
that
none
but
fools
would
keep
a
breath
thou

servile
to
all
the
skyey
influences
that

thou
art
not
noble
for
all
th
accommodations
that
thou
bearst
are
nursd
by
baseness
thou
art
by
no
means
valiant
for
thou
dost
fear
the
soft
and
tender
fork
of
a
poor
worm
thy
best
of
rest
is
sleep
and
that
thou
oft
provokst
yet
grossly
fearst
thy
death
which
is
no
more
thou
art
not
thyself
for
thou
existst
on
many
a
thousand
grains
that
issue
out
of
dust
happy
thou
art
not
for
what
thou
hast
not
still
thou
strivst
to
get
and
what
thou
hast
forgetst
thou
art
not
certain
for
thy
complexion
shifts
to
strange
effects
after
the
moon
if
thou
art
rich
thourt
poor
for
like
an
ass
whose
back
with
ingots
bows
thou
bearst
thy
heavy
riches
but
a
journey
and
death
unloads
thee
friend
hast
thou
none
for
thine

bowels
which
do
call
thee
sire
the
mere
effusion
of
thy
proper
loins
do
curse
the
gout
serpigo
and
the
rheum
for
ending
thee
no
sooner
thou
hast
nor
youth
nor

but
as
it
were

for
all
thy
blessed
youth

hast
neither

whats

moe
thousand

these
odds
all
even
i
humbly
thank
you
to
sue
to
live
i
find
i
seek
to
die
and
seeking
death
find
life
let
it
come
on
what
ho
peace
here
grace
and
good
company
whos
there
come
in
the
wish
deserves
a
welcome
dear
sir
ere
long
ill
visit
you
again
most
holy
sir
i
thank
you
my
business
is
a
word
or
two
with
claudio
and
very
welcome
look
signior
heres
your
sister
provost
a
word
with
you
as
many
as
you
please
bring
me
to
hear
them
speak
where
i
may
be
conceald
now
sister
whats
the
comfort
why
as
all
comforts
are
most
good
most
good
indeed
lord
angelo
having
affairs
to
heaven
intends
you
for
his
swift
ambassador
where
you
shall
be
an
everlasting
leiger
therefore
your
best
appointment
make
with
speed
tomorrow
you
set
on
is
there
no
remedy
none
but
such
remedy
as
to
save
a
head
to
cleave
a
heart
in
twain
but
is
there
any
yes
brother
you
may
live
there
is
a
devilish
mercy
in
the
judge
if
youll
implore
it
that
will
free
your
life
but
fetter
you
till
death
perpetual
durance
ay
just
perpetual
durance
a
restraint
though
all
the
worlds
vastidity
you
had
to
a
determind
scope
but
in
what
nature
in
such
a
one
as
you
consenting
tot
would
bark
your
honour
from
that
trunk
you
bear
and
leave
you
naked
let
me
know
the
point
o
i
do
fear
thee
claudio
and
i
quake
lest
thou
a
feverous
life
shouldst
entertain
and
six
or
seven
winters
more
respect
than
a
perpetual
honour
darst
thou
die
the
sense
of
death
is
most
in
apprehension
and
the
poor
beetle
that
we
tread
upon
in
corporal
sufferance
finds
a
pang
as
great
as
when
a
giant
dies
why
give
you
me
this
shame
think
you
i
can
a
resolution
fetch
from
flowery
tenderness
if
i
must
die
i
will
encounter
darkness
as
a
bride
and
hug
it
in
mine
arms
there
spake
my
brother
there
my
fathers
grave
did
utter
forth
a
voice
yes
thou
must
die
thou
art
too
noble
to
conserve
a
life
in
base
appliances
this
outwardsainted
deputy
whose
settled
visage
and
deliberate
word
nips
youth
i
the
head
and
follies
doth
enmew
as
falcon
doth
the
fowl
is
yet
a
devil
his
filth
within
being
cast
he
would
appear
a
pond
as
deep
as
hell
the
prenzie
angelo
o
tis
the
cunning
livery
of
hell
the
damnedst
body
to
invest
and
cover
in
prenzie
guards
dost
thou
think
claudio
if
i
would
yield
him
my
virginity
thou
mightst
be
freed
o
heavens
it
cannot
be
yes
he
would
givet
thee
from
this
rank
offence
so
to
offend
him
still
this
nights
the
time
that
i
should
do
what
i
abhor
to
name
or
else
thou
diest
tomorrow
thou
shalt
not
dot
o
were
it
but
my
life
id
throw
it
down
for
your
deliverance
as
frankly
as
a
pin
thanks
dear
isabel
be
ready
claudio
for
your
death
tomorrow
yes
has
he
affections
in
him
that
thus
can
make
him
bite
the
law
by
the
nose
when
he
would
force
it
sure
it
is
no
sin
or
of
the
deadly
seven
it
is
the
least
which
is
the
least
if
it
were
damnable
he
being
so
wise
why
would
he
for
the
momentary
trick
be
perdurably
find
o
isabel
what
says
my
brother
death
is
a
fearful
thing
and
shamed
life
a
hateful
ay
but
to
die
and
go
we
know
not
where
to
lie
in
cold
obstruction
and
to
rot
this
sensible
warm
motion
to
become
a
kneaded
clod
and
the
delighted
spirit
to
bathe
in
fiery
floods
or
to
reside
in
thrilling
region
of
thickribbed
ice
to
be
imprisond
in
the
viewless
winds
and
blown
with
restless
violence
round
about
the
pendant
world
or
to
be
worse
than
worst
of
those
that
lawless
and
incertain
thoughts
imagine
howling
tis
too
horrible
the
weariest
and
most
loathed
worldly
life
that
age
ache
penury
and
imprisonment
can
lay
on
nature
is
a
paradise
to
what
we
fear
of
death
alas
alas
sweet
sister
let
me
live
what
sin
you
do
to
save
a
brothers
life
nature
dispenses
with

isabella
vouchsafe
a
word
young
sister
but
one
word
what
is
your
will
might
you
dispense
with
your
leisure
i
would
by
and
by
have
some
speech
with
you
the
satisfaction
i
would
require
is
likewise
your
own
benefit
i
have
no
superfluous
leisure
my
stay
must
be
stolen
out
of
other
affairs
but
i
will
attend
you
a
while
son
i
have
overheard
what
hath
past
between
you
and
your
sister
angelo
had
never
the
purpose
to
corrupt
her
only
he
hath
made
an
assay
of
her
virtue
to
practise
his
judgment
with
the
disposition
of
natures
she
having
the
truth
of
honour
in
her
hath
made
him
that
gracious
denial
which
he
is
most
glad
to
receive
i
am
confessor
to
angelo
and
i
know
this
to
be
true
therefore
prepare
yourself
to
death
do
not
satisfy
your
resolution
with
hopes
that
are
fallible
tomorrow
you
must
die
go
to
your
knees
and
make
ready
let
me
ask
my
sister
pardon
i
am
so
out
of
love
with
life
that
i
will
sue
to
be
rid
of
it
hold
you
there
farewell
provost
a
word
with
you
whats
your
will
father
that
now
you
are
come
you
will
be
gone
leave
me
awhile
with
the
maid
my
mind
promises
with
my
habit
no
loss
shall
touch
her
by
my
company
in
good
time
the
hand
that
hath
made
you
fair
hath
made
you
good
the
goodness
that
is
cheap
in
beauty
makes
beauty
brief
in
goodness
but
grace
being
the
soul
of
your
complexion
shall
keep
the
body
of
it
ever
fair
the
assault
that
angelo
hath
made
to
you
fortune
hath
conveyed
to
my
understanding
and
but
that
frailty
hath
examples
for
his
falling
i
should
wonder
at
angelo
how
would
you
do
to
content
this
substitute
and
to
save
your
brother
i
am
now
going
to
resolve
him
i
had
rather
my
brother
die
by
the
law
than
my
son
should
be
unlawfully
born
but
o
how
much
is
the
good
duke
deceived
in
angelo
if
ever
he
return
and
i
can
speak
to
him
i
will
open
my
lips
in
vain
or
discover
his
government
that
shall
not
be
much
amiss
yet
as
the
matter
now
stands
he
will
avoid
your
accusation
he
made
trial
of
you
only
therefore
fasten
your
ear
on
my
advisings
to
the
love
i
have
in
doing
good
a
remedy
presents
itself
i
do
make
myself
believe
that
you
may
most
uprighteously
do
a
poor
wronged
lady
a
merited
benefit
redeem
your
brother
from
the
angry
law
do
no
stain
to
your
own
gracious
person
and
much
please
the
absent
duke
if
peradventure
he
shall
ever
return
to
have
hearing
of
this
business
let
me
hear
you
speak
further
i
have
spirit
to
do
anything
that
appears
not
foul
in
the
truth
of
my
spirit
virtue
is
bold
and
goodness
never
fearful
have
you
not
heard
speak
of
mariana
the
sister
of
frederick
the
great
soldier
who
miscarried
at
sea
i
have
heard
of
the
lady
and
good
words
went
with
her
name
she
should
this
angelo
have
married
was
affianced
to
her
by
oath
and
the
nuptial
appointed
between
which
time
of
the
contract
and
limit
of
the
solemnity
her
brother
frederick
was
wracked
at
sea
having
in
that
perished
vessel
the
dowry
of
his
sister
but
mark
how
heavily
this
befell
to
the
poor
gentlewoman
there
she
lost
a
noble
and
renowned
brother
in
his
love
toward
her
ever
most
kind
and
natural
with
him
the
portion
and
sinew
of
her
fortune
her
marriagedowry
with
both
her
combinate
husband
this
wellseeming
angelo
can
this
be
so
did
angelo
so
leave
her
left
her
in
her
tears
and
dried
not
one
of
them
with
his
comfort
swallowed
his
vows
whole
pretending
in
her
discoveries
of
dishonour
in
few
bestowed
her
on
her
own
lamentation
which
she
yet
wears
for
his
sake
and
he
a
marble
to
her
tears
is
washed
with
them
but
relents
not
what
a
merit
were
it
in
death
to
take
this
poor
maid
from
the
world
what
corruption
in
this
life
that
it
will
let
this
man
live
but
how
out
of
this
can
she
avail
it
is
a
rupture
that
you
may
easily
heal
and
the
cure
of
it
not
only
saves
your
brother
but
keeps
you
from
dishonour
in
doing
it
show
me
how
good
father
this
forenamed
maid
hath
yet
in
her
the
continuance
of
her
first
affection
his
unjust
unkindness
that
in
all
reason
should
have
quenched
her
love
hath
like
an
impediment
in
the
current
made
it
more
violent
and
unruly
go
you
to
angelo
answer
his
requiring
with
a
plausible
obedience
agree
with
his
demands
to
the
point
only
refer
yourself
to
this
advantage
first
that
your
stay
with
him
may
not
be
long
that
the
time
may
have
all
shadow
and
silence
in
it
and
the
place
answer
to
convenience
this
being
granted
in
course
and
now
follows
all
we
shall
advise
this
wronged
maid
to
stead
up
your
appointment
go
in
your
place
if
the
encounter
acknowledge
itself
hereafter
it
may
compel
him
to
her
recompense
and
here
by
this
is
your
brother
saved
your
honour
untainted
the
poor
mariana
advantaged
and
the
corrupt
deputy
scaled
the
maid
will
i
frame
and
make
fit
for
his
attempt
if
you
think
well
to
carry
this
as
you
may
the
doubleness
of
the
benefit
defends
the
deceit
from
reproof
what
think
you
of
it
the
image
of
it
gives
me
content
already
and
i
trust
it
will
grow
to
a
most
prosperous
perfection
it
lies
much
in
your
holding
up
haste
you
speedily
to
angelo
if
for
this
night
he
entreat
you
to
his
bed
give
him
promise
of
satisfaction

the
moated

dejected

that
place

upon
me

may
be
quickly
i
thank
you
for
this
comfort
fare

well

be
no
remedy

it

pompey
go
what
news
friar
of
the
duke
i
know
none
can
you
tell
me
of
any
some
say
he
is
with
the
emperor
of
russia
other
some
he
is
in
rome
but
where
is
he
think
you
i
know
not
where
but
wheresoever
i
wish
him
well
it
was
a
mad
fantastical
trick
of
him
to
steal
from
the
state
and
usurp
the
beggary
he
was
never
born
to
lord
angelo
dukes
it
well
in
his
absence
he
puts
transgression
tot
he
does
well
int
a
little
more
lenity
to
lechery
would
do
no
harm
in
him
something
too
crabbed
that
way
friar
it
is
too
general
a
vice
and
severity
must
cure
it
yes
in
good
sooth
the
vice
is
of
a
great
kindred
it
is
well
allied
but
it
is
impossible
to
extirp
it
quite
friar
till
eating
and
drinking
be
put
down
they
say
this
angelo
was
not
made
by
man
and
woman
after
this
downright
way
of
creation
is
it
true
think
you
how
should
he
be
made
then
some
report
a
seamaid
spawnd
him
some
that
he
was
begot
between
two
stockfishes
but
it
is
certain
that
when
he
makes
water
his
urine
is
congealed
ice
that
i
know
to
be
true
and
he
is
a
motion
generative
thats
infallible
you
are
pleasant
sir
and
speak
apace
why
what
a
ruthless
thing
is
this
in
him
for
the
rebellion
of
a
codpiece
to
take
away
the
life
of
a
man
would
the
duke
that
is
absent
have
done
this
ere
he
would
have
hanged
a
man
for
the
getting
a
hundred
bastards
he
would
have
paid
for
the
nursing
a
thousand
he
had
some
feeling
of
the
sport
he
knew
the
service
and
that
instructed
him
to
mercy
i
never
heard
the
absent
duke
much
detected
for
women
he
was
not
inclined
that
way
o
sir
you
are
deceived
tis
not
possible
who
not
the
duke
yes
your
beggar
of
fifty
and
his
use
was
to
put
a
ducat
in
her
clackdish
the
duke
had
crotchets
in
him
he
would
be
drunk
too
that
let
me
inform
you
you
do
him
wrong
surely
sir
i
was
an
inward
of
his
a
shy
fellow
was
the
duke
and
i
believe
i
know
the
cause
of
his
withdrawing
what
i
prithee
might
be
the
cause
no
pardon
tis
a
secret
must
be
locked
within
the
teeth
and
the
lips
but
this
i
can
let
you
understand
the
greater
file
of
the
subject
held
the
duke
to
be
wise
wise
why
no
question
but
he
was
a
very
superficial
ignorant
unweighing
fellow
either
this
is
envy
in
you
folly
or
mistaking
the
very
stream
of
his
life
and
the
business
he
hath
helmed
must
upon
a
warranted
need
give
him
a
better
proclamation
let
him
be
but
testimonied
in
his
own
bringings
forth
and
he
shall
appear
to
the
envious
a
scholar
a
statesman
and
a
soldier
therefore
you
speak
unskilfully
or
if
your
knowledge
be
more
it
is
much
darkened
in
your
malice
sir
i
know
him
and
i
love
him
love
talks
with
better
knowledge
and
knowledge
with
dearer
love
come
sir
i
know
what
i
know
i
can
hardly
believe
that
since
you
know
not
what
you
speak
but
if
ever
the
duke
return
as
our
prayers
are
he
may
let
me
desire
you
to
make
your
answer
before
him
if
it
be
honest
you
have
spoke
you
have
courage
to
maintain
it
i
am
bound
to
call
upon
you
and
i
pray
you
your
name
sir
my
name
is
lucio
well
known
to
the
duke
he
shall
know
you
better
sir
if
i
may
live
to
report
you
i
fear
you
not
o
you
hope
the
duke
will
return
no
more
or
you
imagine
me
too
unhurtful
an
opposite
but
indeed
i
can
do
you
little
harm
youll
forswear
this
again
ill
be
hanged
first
thou
art
deceived
in
me
friar
but
no
more
of
this
canst
thou
tell
if
claudio
die
tomorrow
or
no
why
should
he
die
sir
why
for
filling
a
bottle
with
a
tundish
i
would
the
duke
we
talk
of
were
returned
again
this
ungenitured
agent
will
unpeople
the
province
with
continency
sparrows
must
not
build
in
his
houseeaves
because
they
are
lecherous
the
duke
yet
would
have
dark
deeds
darkly
answered
he
would
never
bring
them
to
light
would
he
were
returned
marry
this
claudio
is
condemned
for
untrussing
farewell
good
friar
i
prithee
pray
for
me
the
duke
i
say
to
thee
again
would
eat
mutton
on
fridays
hes
not
past
it
yet
and
i
say
to
thee
he
would
mouth
with
a
beggar
though
she
smelt
brown
bread
and
garlic
say
that
i
said
so
farewell
no
might
nor
greatness
in
mortality
can
censure
scape
backwounding
calumny
the
whitest
virtue
strikes
what
king
so
strong
can
tie
the
gall
up
in
the
slanderous
tongue
but
who
comes
here
go
away
with
her

with
child
by
him

promised
her
marriage

child

a
year
and
a
quarter
old
come
philip
and
jacob
i
have
kept
it
myself
and
see
how
he
goes
about
to
abuse
me
that
fellow
is
a
fellow
of
much
licence
let
him
be
called
before
us
away
with
her
to
prison
go
to
no
more
words
provost
my
brother
angelo
will
not
be
altered
claudio
must
die
tomorrow
let
him
be
furnished
with
divines
and
have
all
charitable
preparation
if
my
brother
wrought
by
my
pity
it
should
not
be
so
with
him
so
please
you
this
friar
hath
been
with
him
and
advised
him
for
the
entertainment
of
death
good
even
good
father
bliss
and
goodness
on
you
of
whence
are
you
not
of
this
country
though
my
chance
is
now
to
use
it
for
my
time
i
am
a
brother
of
gracious
order
late
come
from
the
see
in
special
business
from
his
holiness
what
news
abroad
i
the
world
none
but
there
is
so
great
a
fever
on
goodness
that
the
dissolution
of
it
must
cure
it
novelty
is
only
in
request
and
it
is
as
dangerous
to
be
aged
in
any
kind
of
course
as
it
is
virtuous
to
be
constant
in
any
undertaking
there
is
scarce
truth
enough
alive
to
make
societies
secure
but
security
enough
to
make
fellowships
accursed
much
upon
this
riddle
runs
the
wisdom
of
the
world
this
news
is
old
enough
yet
it
is
every
days
news
i
pray
you
sir
of
what
disposition
was
the
duke
one
that
above
all
other
strifes
contended
especially
to
know
himself
what
pleasure
was
he
given
to
rather
rejoicing
to
see
another
merry
than
merry
at
anything
which
professed
to
make
him
rejoice
a
gentleman
of
all
temperance
but
leave
we
him
to
his
events
with
a
prayer
they
may
prove
prosperous
and
let
me
desire
to
know
how
you
find
claudio
prepared
i
am
made
to
understand
that
you
have
lent
him
visitation
he
professes
to
have
received
no
sinister
measure
from
his
judge
but
most
willingly
humbles
himself
to
the
determination
of
justice
yet
had
he
framed
to
himself
by
the
instruction
of
his
frailty
many
deceiving
promises
of
life
which
i
by
my
good
leisure
have
discredited
to
him
and
now
is
he
resolved
to
die
you
have
paid
the
heavens
your
function
and
the
prisoner
the
very
debt
of
your
calling
i
have
laboured
for
the
poor
gentleman
to
the
extremest
shore
of
my
modesty
but
my
brother
justice
have
i
found
so
severe
that
he
hath
forced
me
to
tell
him
he
is
indeed
justice
if
his
own
life
answer
the
straitness
of
his
proceeding
it
shall
become
him
well
wherein
if
he
chance
to
fail
he
hath
sentenced
himself
i
am
going
to
visit
the
prisoner
fare
you
well
peace
be
with
you
he
who
the
sword
of
heaven
will
bear
should
be
as
holy
as
severe
pattern
in
himself
to
know
grace
to
stand
and
virtue
go
more
nor
less
to
others
paying
than
by
self
offences
weighing
shame
to
him
whose
cruel
striking
kills
for
faults
of
his
own
liking
twice
treble
shame
on
angelo
to
weed
my
vice
and
let
his
grow
o
what
may
man
within
him
hide
though
angel
on
the
outward
side
how
many
likeness
made
in
crimes
making
practice
on
the
times
to
draw
with
idle
spiders
strings
most
pondrous
and
substantial
things
craft
against
vice
i
must
apply
with
angelo
tonight
shall
lie
his
old
betrothed
but
despisd
so
disguise
shall
by
the
disguisd
pay
with
falsehood
false
exacting
and
perform
an
old
contracting
take
o
take
those
lips
away
that
so
sweetly
were
forsworn
and
those
eyes
the
break
of
day
lights
that
do
mislead
the
morn
but
my
kisses
bring
again
bring
again
seals
of
love
but
seald
in
vain
seald
in
vain
break
off
thy
song
and
haste
thee
quick
away

a
man
of
comfort

advice
hath
often
stilld
my
brawling
discontent
i

mirth

displeasd
but
pleasd

woe

harm

long
what

for
claudio
theres
some
in
hope
it
is
a
bitter
deputy
not
so
not
so
his
life
is
paralleld
even
with
the
stroke
and
line
of
his
great
justice
he
doth
with
holy
abstinence
subdue
that
in
himself
which
he
spurs
on
his
power
to
qualify
in
others
were
he
meald
with
that
which
he
corrects
then
were
he
tyrannous
but
this
being
so
hes
just
now
are
they

this
is
a
gentle
provost
seldom
when
the
steeled
gaoler

the
friend

the
unsisting
postern

dawning
provost
as
it
is
you

hear
more
ere
morning
happily
you
something
know
yet
i
believe
there
comes
no
countermand
no
such
example
have
we
besides
upon
the
very
siege
of
justice
lord
angelo
hath
to
the
public
ear
professd
the
contrary
this
is
his
lordships
man
and
here
comes
claudios
pardon
my
lord
hath
sent
you
this
note
and
by
me
this
further
charge
that
you
swerve
not
from
the
smallest
article
of
it
neither
in
time
matter
or
other
circumstance
good
morrow
for
as
i
take
it
it
is
almost
day
i
shall
obey
him
this
is
his
pardon
purchased
by
such
sin
for
which
the
pardoner
himself
is
in
hence
hath
offence
his
quick
celerity
when
it
is
borne
in
high
authority
when
vice
makes
mercy
mercys
so
extended
that
for
the
faults
love
is
the
offender
friended
now
sir
what
news
i
told
you
lord
angelo
belike
thinking
me
remiss
in
mine
office
awakens
me
with
this
unwonted
putting
on
methinks
strangely
for
he
hath
not
used
it
before
pray
you
lets
hear
whatsoever
you
may
hear
to
the
contrary
let
claudio
be
executed
by
four
of
the
clock
and
in
the
afternoon
barnardine
for
my
better
satisfaction
let
me
have
claudios
head
sent
me
by
five
let
this
be
duly
performed
with
a
thought
that
more
depends
on
it
than
we
must
yet
deliver
thus
fail
not
to
do
your
office
as
you
will
answer
it
at
your
peril
what
say
you
to
this
sir
what
is
that
barnardine
who
is
to
be
executed
this
afternoon
a
bohemian
born
but
here
nursed
up
and
bred
one
that
is
a
prisoner
nine
years
old
how
came
it
that
the
absent
duke
had
not
either
delivered
him
to
his
liberty
or
executed
him
i
have
heard
it
was
ever
his
manner
to
do
so
his
friends
still
wrought
reprieves
for
him
and
indeed
his
fact
till
now
in
the
government
of
lord
angelo
came
not
to
an
undoubtful
proof
it
is
now
apparent
most
manifest
and
not
denied
by
himself
hath
he
borne
himself
penitently
in
prison
how
seems
he
to
be
touched
a
man
that
apprehends
death
no
more
dreadfully
but
as
a
drunken
sleep
careless
reckless
and
fearless
of
whats
past
present
or
to
come
insensible
of
mortality
and
desperately
mortal
he
wants
advice
he
will
hear
none
he
hath
evermore
had
the
liberty
of
the
prison
give
him
leave
to
escape
hence
he
would
not
drunk
many
times
a
day
if
not
many
days
entirely
drunk
we
have
very
oft
awaked
him
as
if
to
carry
him
to
execution
and
showed
him
a
seeming
warrant
for
it
it
hath
not
moved
him
at
all
more
of
him
anon
there
is
written
in
your
brow
provost
honesty
and
constancy
if
i
read
it
not
truly
my
ancient
skill
beguiles
me
but
in
the
boldness
of
my
cunning
i
will
lay
myself
in
hazard
claudio
whom
here
you
have
warrant
to
execute
is
no
greater
forfeit
to
the
law
than
angalo
who
hath
sentenced
him
to
make
you
understand
this
in
a
manifested
effect
i
crave
but
four
days
respite
for
the
which
you
are
to
do
me
both
a
present
and
a
dangerous
courtesy
pray
sir
in
what
in
the
delaying
death
alack
how
may
i
do
it
having
the
hour
limited
and
an
express
command
under
penalty
to
deliver
his
head
in
the
view
of
angelo
i
may
make
my
case
as
claudios
to
cross
this
in
the
smallest
by
the
vow
of
mine
order
i
warrant
you
if
my
instructions
may
be
your
guide
let
this
barnardine
be
this
morning
executed
and
his
head
borne
to
angelo
angelo
hath
seen
them
both
and
will
discover
the
favour
o
deaths
a
great
disguiser
and
you
may
add
to
it
shave
the
head
and
tie
the
beard
and
say
it
was
the
desire
of
the
penitent
to
be
so
bared
before
his
death
you
know
the
course
is
common
if
anything
fall
to
you
upon
this
more
than
thanks
and
good
fortune
by
the
saint
whom
i
profess
i
will
plead
against
it
with
my
life
pardon
me
good
father
it
is
against
my
oath
were
you
sworn
to
the
duke
or
to
the
deputy
to
him
and
to
his
substitutes
you
will
think
you
have
made
no
offence
if
the
duke
avouch
the
justice
of
your
dealing
but
what
likelihood
is
in
that
not
a
resemblance
but
a
certainty
yet
since
i
see
you
fearful
that
neither

bran
i

not
for
my
head
fill
my
belly
one
fruitful
meal
would
set

but
they
say
the
duke
will
be
here
tomorrow
by
my
troth
isabel
i
loved
thy
brother
if
the
old
fantastical
duke
of
dark
corners
had
been
at
home
he
had
lived
sir
the
duke
is
marvellous
little
beholding
to
your
reports
but
the
best
is
he
lives
not
in
them
friar
thou
knowest
not
the
duke
so
well
as
i
do
hes
a
better
woodman
than
thou
takest
him

well
youll
answer
this
one
day
fare
ye
well
nay
tarry
ill
go
along
with
thee
i
can
tell
thee
pretty
tales
of
the
duke
you
have
told
me
too
many
of
him
already
sir
if
they
be
true
if
not
true
none
were
enough
i
was
once
before
him
for
getting
a
wench
with
child
did
you
such
a
thing
yes
marry
did
i
but
i
was
fain
to
forswear
it
they
would
else
have
married
me
to
the
rotten
medlar
sir
your
company
is
fairer
than
honest
rest
you

by
my
troth

bawdy
talk
offend
you
well
have
very
little
of
it
nay
friar
i
am
a
kind
of
burr
i
shall
stick
every
letter
he
hath
writ
hath
disvouched
other
in
most
uneven
and
distracted
manner
his
actions
show
much
like
to
madness
pray
heaven
his
wisdom
be
not
tainted
and
why
meet
him
at
the
gates
and
redeliver
our
authorities
there
i
guess
not
and
why
should
we
proclaim
it
in
an
hour
before
his
entering
that
if
any
crave
redress
of
injustice
they
should
exhibit
their
petitions
in
the
street
he
shows
his
reason
for
that
to
have
a
dispatch
of
complaints
and
to
deliver
us
from
devices
hereafter
which
shall
then
have
no
power
to
stand
against
us
well
i
beseech
you
let
it
be
proclaimd
betimes
i
the
morn
ill
call
you
at
your
house
give
notice
to
such
men
of
sort
and
suit
as
are
to
meet
him
i
shall
sir
fare
you
well
good
night
this
deed
unshapes
me
quite
makes
me
unpregnant
and
dull
to
all
proceedings
a
deflowerd
maid
and
by
an
eminent
body
that
enforcd
the
law
against
it
but
that
her
tender
shame
will
not
proclaim
against
her
maiden
loss
how
might
she
tongue
me
yet
reason
dares
her
no
for
my
authority
bears
so
credent
bulk
that
no
particular
scandal
once
can
touch
but
it
confounds
the
breather
he
should
have
livd
save
that
his
riotous
youth
with
dangerous
sense
might
in
the
times
to
come
have
taen
revenge
by
so
receiving
a
dishonourd
life
with
ransom
of
such
shame
would
yet
he
had
livd
alack
when
once
our
grace
we
have
forgot
nothing
goes
right
we
would
and
we
would
not
these
letters
at
fit
time
deliver
me
the
provost

our
purpose
and
our
plot
the
matter
being
afoot
keep
your
instruction
and
hold
you
ever
to
our
special
drift
though
sometimes
you
do
blench
from
this
to
that
as
cause
doth
minister
go
call
at
flavius
house
and
tell
him
where
i
stay

like
notice

gentle
varrius
to

part

im
advisd
to
do
it
he
says
to
veil
full
purpose

ruld
by

tells
me
that

adverse
side

should
wrong
it
to

with
characters
of
brass
a
forted
residence
gainst
the
tooth
of
time
and
razure
of
oblivion
give
me
your
hand

subject

courtesies

fain
proclaim
favours
that

within

must
walk
by
us
on
our
other
hand
and
good
supporters
are

time

and
kneel
before

justice
o
royal
duke
vail
your
regard
upon
a
wrongd
id
fain
have
said
a
maid
o
worthy
prince
dishonour
not
your
eye
by
throwing
it
on
any
other
object
till
you
have
heard
me
in
my
true
complaint
and
given
me
justice
justice
justice
justice
relate
your
wrongs
in
what
by
whom
be
brief
here
is
lord
angelo
shall
give
you
justice
reveal
yourself
to
him
o
worthy
duke
you
bid
me
seek
redemption
of
the
devil
hear
me
yourself
for
that
which
i
must
speak
must
either
punish
me
not
being
believd
or
wring
redress
from
you
hear
me
o
hear
me
here
my
lord
her
wits
i
fear
me
are
not
firm
she
hath
been
a
suitor
to
me
for
her
brother
cut
off
by
course
of
justice
by
course
of
justice
and
she
will
speak
most
bitterly
and
strange
most
strange
but
yet
most
truly
will
i
speak
that
angelos
forsworn
is
it
not
strange
that
angelos
a
murderer
ist
not
strange
that
angelo
is
an
adulterous
thief
a
hypocrite
a
virginviolator
is
it
not
strange
and
strange
nay
it
is
ten
times
strange
it
is
not
truer
he
is
angelo
than
this
is
all
as
true
as
it
is
strange
nay
it
is
ten
times
true
for
truth
is
truth
to
the
end
of
reckoning
away
with
her
poor
soul
she
speaks
this
in
the
infirmity
of
sense
o
prince
i
conjure
thee
as
thou
believst
there
is
another
comfort
than
this
world
that
thou
neglect
me
not
with
that
opinion
that
i
am
touchd
with
madness
make
not
impossible
that
which
but
seems
unlike
tis
not
impossible
but
one
the
wickedst
caitiff
on
the
ground
may
seem
as
shy
as
grave
as
just
as
absolute
as
angelo
even
so
may
angelo
in
all
his
dressings
characts
titles
forms
be
an
archvillain
believe
it
royal
prince
if
he
be
less
hes
nothing
but
hes
more
had
i
more
name
for
badness
by
mine
honesty
if
she
be
mad
as
i
believe
no
other
her
madness
hath
the
oddest
frame
of
sense
such
a
dependency
of
thing
on
thing
as
eer
i
heard
in
madness
o
gracious
duke
harp
not
on
that
nor
do
not
banish
reason
for
inequality
but
let
your
reason
serve
to
make
the
truth
appear
where
it
seems
hid
and
hide
the
false
seems
true
many
that
are
not
mad
have
sure
more
lack
of
reason
what
would
you
say
i
am
the
sister
of
one
claudio
condemnd
upon
the
act
of
fornication
to
lose
his
head
condemnd
by
angelo
i
in
probation
of
a
sisterhood
was
sent
to
by
my
brother
one
lucio
as
then
the
messenger
thats
i
ant
like
your
grace
i
came
to
her
from
claudio
and
desird
her
to
try
her
gracious
fortune
with
lord
angelo
for
her
poor
brothers
pardon
thats
he
indeed
you
were
not
bid
to
speak
no
my
good
lord
nor
wishd
to
hold
my
peace
i
wish
you
now
then
pray
you
take
note
of
it
and
when
you
have
a
business
for
yourself
pray
heaven
you
then
be
perfect
i
warrant
your
honour
the
warrants
for
yourself
take
heed
to
it
this
gentleman
told
somewhat
of
my
tale
right
it
may
be
right
but
you
are
in
the
wrong
to
speak
before
your
time
proceed
i
went
to
this
pernicious
caitiff
deputy
thats
somewhat
madly
spoken
pardon
it
the
phrase
is
to
the
matter
mended
again
the
matter
proceed
in
brief
to
set
the
needless
process
by
how
i
persuaded
how
i
prayd
and
kneeld
how
he
refelld
me
and
how
i
replied
for
this
was
of
much
length
the
vile
conclusion
i
now
begin
with
grief
and
shame
to
utter
he
would
not
but
by
gift
of
my
chaste
body
to
his
concupiscible
intemperate
lust
release
my
brother
and
after
much
debatement
my
sisterly
remorse
confutes
mine
honour
and
i
did
yield
to
him
but
the
next
morn
betimes
his
purpose
surfeiting
he
sends
a
warrant
for
my
poor
brothers
head
this
is
most
likely
o
that
it
were
as
like
as
it
is
true
by
heaven
fond
wretch
thou
knowst
not
what
thou
speakst
or
else
thou
art
subornd
against
his
honour
in
hateful
practice
first
his
integrity
stands
without
blemish
next
it
imports
no
reason
that
with
such
vehemency
he
should
pursue
faults
proper
to
himself
if
he
had
so
offended
he
would
have
weighd
thy
brother
by
himself
and
not
have
cut
him
off
some
one
hath
set
you
on
confess
the
truth
and
say
by
whose
advice
thou
camst
here
to
complain
and
is
this
all
then
o
you
blessed
ministers
above
keep
me
in
patience
and
with
ripend
time
unfold
the
evil
which
is
here
wrapt
up
in
countenance

shield
your
grace
from
woe
as
i
thus
wrongd
hence
unbelieved

youd
fain

shall
we
thus
permit
a
blasting
and
a
scandalous
breath
to
fall
on
him
so
near

needs
must
be
a
practice

this
woman
and
five
years
since
there
was
some
speech
of
marriage
betwixt
myself
and
her
which
was
broke
off
partly
for
that
her
promised
proportions
came
short
of
composition
but
in
chief
for
that
her
reputation
was
disvalud
in
levity
since
which
time
of
five
years
i
never
spake
with
her
saw
her
nor
heard
from
her
upon
my
faith
and
honour
noble
prince
as
there
comes
light
from
heaven
and
words
from
breath
as
there
is
sense
in
truth
and
truth
in
virtue

am
affiancd
this
mans
wife
as
strongly
as
words
could
make
up
vows

my
patience
here

of
some
more
mightier
member
that
sets
them
on
let

find
this
practice

on
let

were
here

be
you
as
free
to
us
your
brothers
death
i
know
sits
at
your
heart
and
you
may
marvel
why
i
obscurd
myself
labouring
to
save
his
life
and
would
not
rather
make
rash
remonstrance
of
my
hidden
power
than
let
him
so
be
lost
o
most
kind
maid
it
was
the
swift
celerity
of
his
death
which
i
did
think
with
slower
foot
came
on
that
braind
my
purpose
but
peace
be
with
him
that
life
is
better
life
past
fearing

i
do
my

for
this
newmarried

hath
wrongd

as
he
adjudgd
your

being
criminal
in
double
violation
of
sacred
chastity
and
of
promisebreach
thereon
dependent
for
your
brothers
life
the
very
mercy
of
the
law
cries
out
most
audible
even
from
his
proper
tongue
an
angelo
for
claudio
death
for
death
haste
still
pays
haste
and
leisure
answers
leisure
like
doth
quit
like
and
measure
still
for
measure
then
angelo
thy
faults
thus
manifested
which
though
thou
wouldst
deny
denies
thee
vantage
we
do
condemn
thee
to
the
very
block
where
claudio
stoopd
to
death
and
with
like
haste
away
with
him
o
my
most
gracious
lord
i
hope
you
will
not
mock
me
with
a
husband
it
is
your
husband
mockd
you
with
a
husband
consenting
to
the
safeguard
of
your
honour
i
thought
your
marriage
fit
else
imputation
for
that
he
knew
you
might
reproach
your
life
and
choke
your

since

let
him
not

my

had
but
justice
in
that
he
did
the
thing
for
which
he
died
for
angelo
his
act
did
not
oertake
his
bad
intent
and
must
be
buried
but
as
an
intent
that
perishd
by
the
way
thoughts
are
no
subjects
intents
but
merely
thoughts
merely
my
lord
your
suits
unprofitable
stand
up
i
say
i
have
bethought
me
of
another
fault
provost
how
came
it
claudio
was
beheaded
at
an
unusual
hour
it
was
commanded
so
had
you
a
special
warrant
for
the
deed
no
my
good
lord
it
was
by
private
message
for
which
i
do
discharge
you
of
your
office
give
up
your
keys
pardon
me
noble
lord
i
thought
it
was
a
fault
but
knew
it
not
yet
did
repent
me
after
more
advice
for
testimony
whereof
one
in
the
prison
that
should
by
private
order
else
have
died
i
have
reservd
alive
whats
he

hadst
done
so
by
claudio

me
look
upon
him
i
am
sorry
one
so
learned
and
so
wise
as
you
lord
angelo
have
still
appeard
should
slip
so
grossly
both
in
the
heat
of
blood
and
lack
of
temperd
judgment
afterward
i
am
sorry
that
such
sorrow
i
procure
and
so
deep
sticks
it
in
my
penitent
heart
that
i
crave
death
more
willingly
than
mercy
tis
my
deserving
and
i
do
entreat
it
which
is
that
barnardine
this
my
lord
there
was
a
friar
told
me
of
this
man

a
stubborn
soul
that

no
further
than
this
world

thourt
condemnd

earthly
faults

you
all
should
know
much
ado
about

i
learn
in
this
letter
that
don
pedro
of
arragon
comes
this
night
to
messina
he
is
very
near
by
this
he
was
not
three
leagues
off
when
i
left
him
how
many
gentlemen
have
you
lost
in
this
action
but
few
of
any
sort
and
none
of
name
a
victory
is
twice
itself
when
the
achiever
brings
home
full
numbers
i
find
here
that
don
pedro
hath
bestowed
much
honour
on
a
young
florentine
called
claudio
much
deserved
on
his
part
and
equally
remembered
by
don
pedro
he
hath
borne
himself
beyond
the
promise
of
his
age
doing
in
the
figure
of
a
lamb
the
feats
of
a
lion
he
hath
indeed
better
bettered
expectation
than
you
must
expect
of
me
to
tell
you
how
he
hath
an
uncle
here
in
messina
will
be
very
much
glad
of
it
i
have
already
delivered
him
letters
and
there
appears
much
joy
in
him
even
so
much
that
joy
could
not
show
itself
modest
enough
without
a
badge
of
bitterness
did
he
break
out
into
tears
in
great
measure
a
kind
overflow
of
kindness
there
are
no
faces
truer
than
those
that
are
so
washed
how
much
better
is
it
to
weep
at
joy
than
to
joy
at
weeping
i
pray
you
is
signior
mountanto
returned
from
the
wars
or
no
i
know
none
of
that
name
lady
there
was
none
such
in
the
army
of
any
sort
what
is
he
that
you
ask
for
niece
my
cousin
means
signior
benedick
of
padua
o
he
is
returned
and
as
pleasant
as
ever
he
was
he
set
up
his
bills
here
in
messina
and
challenged
cupid
at
the
flight
and
my
uncles
fool
reading
the
challenge
subscribed
for
cupid
and
challenged
him
at
the
birdbolt
i
pray
you
how
many
hath
he
killed
and
eaten
in
these
wars
but
how
many
hath
he
killed
for
indeed
i
promised
to
eat
all
of
his
killing
faith
niece
you
tax
signior
benedick
too
much
but
hell
be
meet
with
you
i
doubt
it
not
he
hath
done
good
service
lady
in
these
wars
you
had
musty
victual
and
he
hath
holp
to
eat
it
he
is
a
very
valiant
trencherman
he
hath
an
excellent
stomach
and
a
good
soldier
too
lady
and
a
good
soldier
to
a
lady
but
what
is
he
to
a
lord
a
lord
to
a
lord
a
man
to
a
man
stuffed
with
all
honourable
virtues
it
is
so
indeed
he
is
no
less
than
a
stuffed
man
but
for
the
stuffing
well
we
are
all
mortal
you
must
not
sir
mistake
my
niece
there
is
a
kind
of
merry
war
betwixt
signior
benedick
and
her
they
never
meet
but
theres
a
skirmish
of
wit
between
them
alas
he
gets
nothing
by
that
in
our
last
conflict
four
of
his
five
wits
went
halting
off
and
now
is
the
whole
man
governed
with
one
so
that
if
he
have
wit
enough
to
keep
himself
warm
let
him
bear
it
for
a
difference
between
himself
and
his
horse
for
it
is
all
the
wealth
that
he
hath
left
to
be
known
a
reasonable
creature
who
is
his
companion
now
he
hath
every
month
a
new
sworn
brother
ist
possible
very
easily
possible
he
wears
his
faith
but
as
the
fashion
of
his
hat
it
ever
changes
with
the
next
block
i
see
lady
the
gentleman
is
not
in
your
books
no
an
he
were
i
would
burn
my
study
but
i
pray
you
who
is
his
companion
is
there
no
young
squarer
now
that
will
make
a
voyage
with
him
to
the
devil
he
is
most
in
the
company
of
the
right
noble
claudio
o
lord
he
will
hang
upon
him
like
a
disease
he
is
sooner
caught
than
the
pestilence
and
the
taker
runs
presently
mad
god
help
the
noble
claudio
if
he
have
caught
the
benedick
it
will
cost
him
a
thousand
pound
ere
a
be
cured
i
will
hold
friends
with
you
lady
do
good
friend
you
will
never
run
mad
niece
no
not
till
a
hot
january
don
pedro
is
approached
good
signior
leonato
you
are
come
to
meet
your
trouble
the
fashion
of
the
world
is
to
avoid
cost
and
you
encounter
it
never
came
trouble
to
my
house
in
the
likeness
of
your
grace
for
trouble
being
gone
comfort
should
remain
but
when
you
depart
from
me
sorrow
abides
and
happiness
takes
his
leave
you
embrace
your
charge
too
willingly
i
think
this
is
your
daughter
her
mother
hath
many
times
told
me
so
were
you
in
doubt
sir
that
you
asked
her
signior
benedick
no
for
then
you
were
a
child
you
have
it
full
benedick
we
may
guess
by
this
what
you
are
being
a
man
truly
the
lady
fathers
herself
be
happy
lady
for
you
are
like
an
honourable
father
if
signior
leonato
be
her
father
she
would
not
have
his
head
on
her
shoulders
for
all
messina
as
like
him
as
she
is
i
wonder
that
you
will
still
be
talking
signior
benedick
nobody
marks
you
what
my
dear
lady
disdain
are
you
yet
living
is
it
possible
disdain
should
die
while
she
hath
such
meet
food
to
feed
it
as
signior
benedick
courtesy
itself
must
convert
to
disdain
if
you
come
in
her
presence
then
is
courtesy
a
turncoat
but
it
is
certain
i
am
loved
of
all
ladies
only
you
excepted
and
i
would
i
could
find
in
my
heart
that
i
had
not
a
hard
heart
for
truly
i
love
none
a
dear
happiness
to
women
they
would
else
have
been
troubled
with
a
pernicious
suitor
i
thank
god
and
my
cold
blood
i
am
of
your
humour
for
that
i
had
rather
hear
my
dog
bark
at
a
crow
than
a
man
swear
he
loves
me
god
keep
your
ladyship
still
in
that
mind
so
some
gentleman
or
other
shall
scape
a
predestinate
scratched
face
scratching
could
not
make
it
worse
an
twere
such
a
face
as
yours
were
well
you
are
a
rare
parrotteacher
a
bird
of
my
tongue
is
better
than
a
beast
of
yours
i
would
my
horse
had
the
speed
of
your
tongue
and
so
good
a
continuer
but
keep
your
way
i
gods
name
i
have
done
you
always
end
with
a
jades
trick
i
know
you
of
old
this
is
the
sum
of
all
leonato
signior
claudio
and
signior
benedick
my
dear
friend
leonato
hath
invited
you
all
i
tell
him
we
shall
stay
here
at
the
least
a
month
and
he
heartily
prays
some
occasion
may
detain
us
longer
i
dare
swear
he
is
no
hypocrite
but
prays
from
his
heart
if
you
swear
my
lord
you
shall
not
be
forsworn
let
me
bid
you
welcome
my
lord
being
reconciled
to
the
prince
your
brother
i
owe
you
all
duty
i
thank
you
i
am
not
of
many
words
but
i
thank
you
please
it
your
grace
lead
on
your
hand
leonato
we
will
go
together
benedick
didst
thou
note
the
daughter
of
signior
leonato
i
noted
her
not
but
i
looked
on
her
is
she
not
a
modest
young
lady
do
you
question
me
as
an
honest
man
should
do
for
my
simple
true
judgment
or
would
you
have
me
speak
after
my
custom
as
being
a
professed
tyrant
to
their
sex
no
i
pray
thee
speak
in
sober
judgment
why
i
faith
methinks
shes
too
low
for
a
high
praise
too
brown
for
a
fair
praise
and
too
little
for
a
great
praise
only
this
commendation
i
can
afford
her
that
were
she
other
than
she
is
she
were
unhandsome
and
being
no
other
but
as
she
is
i
do
not
like
her
thou
thinkest
i
am
in
sport
i
pray
thee
tell
me
truly
how
thou
likest
her
would
you
buy
her
that
you
inquire
after
her
can
the
world
buy
such
a
jewel
yea
and
a
case
to
put
it
into
but
speak
you
this
with
a
sad
brow
or
do
you
play
the
flouting
jack
to
tell
us
cupid
is
a
good
harefinder
and
vulcan
a
rare
carpenter
come
in
what
key
shall
a
man
take
you
to
go
in
the
song
in
mine
eye
she
is
the
sweetest
lady
that
ever
i
looked
on
i
can
see
yet
without
spectacles
and
i
see
no
such
matter
theres
her
cousin
an
she
were
not
possessed
with
a
fury
exceeds
her
as
much
in
beauty
as
the
first
of
may
doth
the
last
of
december
but
i
hope
you
have
no
intent
to
turn
husband
have
you
i
would
scarce
trust
myself
though
i
had
sworn
to
the
contrary
if
hero
would
be
my
wife
ist
come
to
this
i
faith
hath
not
the
world
one
man
but
he
will
wear
his
cap
with
suspicion
shall
i
never
see
a
bachelor
of
threescore
again
go
to
i
faith
an
thou
wilt
needs
thrust
thy
neck
into
a
yoke
wear
the
print
of
it
and
sigh
away
sundays
look
don
pedro
is
returned
to
seek
you
what
secret
hath
held
you
here
that
you
followed
not
to
leonatos
i
would
your
grace
would
constrain
me
to
tell
i
charge
thee
on
thy
allegiance
you
hear
count
claudio
i
can
be
secret
as
a
dumb
man
i
would
have
you
think
so
but
on
my
allegiance
mark
you
this
on
my
allegiance
he
is
in
love
with
who
now
that
is
your
graces
part
mark
how
short
his
answer
is
with
hero
leonatos
short
daughter
if
this
were
so
so
were
it
uttered
like
the
old
tale
my
lord
it
is
not
so
nor
twas
not
so
but
indeed
god
forbid
it
should
be
so
if
my
passion
change
not
shortly
god
forbid
it
should
be
otherwise
amen
if
you
love
her
for
the
lady
is
very
well
worthy
you
speak
this
to
fetch
me
in
my
lord
by
my
troth
i
speak
my
thought
and
in
faith
my
lord
i
spoke
mine
and
by
my
two
faiths
and
troths
my
lord
i
spoke
mine
that
i
love
her
i
feel
that
she
is
worthy
i
know
that
i
neither
feel
how
she
should
be
loved
nor
know
how
she
should
be
worthy
is
the
opinion
that
fire
cannot
melt
out
of
me
i
will
die
in
it
at
the
stake
thou
wast
ever
an
obstinate
heretic
in
the
despite
of
beauty
and
never
could
maintain
his
part
but
in
the
force
of
his
will
that
a
woman
conceived
me
i
thank
her
that
she
brought
me
up
i
likewise
give
her
most
humble
thanks
but
that
i
will
have
a
recheat
winded
in
my
forehead
or
hang
my
bugle
in
an
invisible
baldrick
all
women
shall
pardon
me
because
i
will
not
do
them
the
wrong
to
mistrust
any
i
will
do
myself
the
right
to
trust
none
and
the
fine
is
for
the
which
i
may
go
the
finer
i
will
live
a
bachelor
i
shall
see
thee
ere
i
die
look
pale
with
love
with
anger
with
sickness
or
with
hunger
my
lord
not
with
love
prove
that
ever
i
lose
more
blood
with
love
than
i
will
get
again
with
drinking
pick
out
mine
eyes
with
a
balladmakers
pen
and
hang
me
up
at
the
door
of
a
brothelhouse
for
the
sign
of
blind
cupid
well
if
ever
thou
dost
fall
from
this
faith
thou
wilt
prove
a
notable
argument
if
i
do
hang
me
in
a
bottle
like
a
cat
and
shoot
at
me
and
he
that
hits
me
let
him
be
clapped
on
the
shoulder
and
called
adam
well
as
time
shall
try
in
time
the
savage
bull
doth
bear
the
yoke
the
savage
bull
may
but
if
ever
the
sensible
benedick
bear
it
pluck
off
the
bulls
horns
and
set
them
in
my
forehead
and
let
me
be
vilely
painted
and
in
such
great
letters
as
they
write
here
is
good
horse
to
hire
let
them
signify
under
my
sign
here
you
may
see
benedick
the
married
man
if
this
should
ever
happen
thou
wouldst
be
hornmad
nay
if
cupid
have
not
spent
all
his
quiver
in
venice
thou
wilt
quake
for
this
shortly
i
look
for
an
earthquake
too
then
well
you
will
temporize
with
the
hours
in
the
meantime
good
signior
benedick
repair
to
leonatos
commend
me
to
him
and
tell
him
i
will
not
fail
him
at
supper
for
indeed
he
hath
made
great
preparation
i
have
almost
matter
enough
in
me
for
such
an
embassage
and
so
i
commit
you
to
the
tuition
of
god
from
my
house
if
i
had
it
the
sixth
of
july
your
loving
friend
benedick
nay
mock
not
mock
not
the
body
of
your
discourse
is
sometime
guarded
with
fragments
and
the
guards
are
but
slightly
basted
on
neither
ere
you
flout
old
ends
any
further
examine
your
conscience
and
so
i
leave
you
my
liege
your
highness
now
may
do
me
good
my
love
is
thine
to
teach
teach
it
but
how
and
thou
shalt
see
how
apt
it
is
to
learn
any
hard
lesson
that
may
do
thee
good
hath
leonato
any
son
my
lord
no
child
but
hero
shes
his
only
heir
dost
thou
affect
her
claudio
o
my
lord
when
you
went
onward
on
this
ended
action
i
looked
upon
her
with
a
soldiers
eye
that
likd
but
had
a
rougher
task
in
hand
than
to
drive
liking
to
the
name
of
love
but
now
i
am
returnd
and
that
warthoughts
have
left
their
places
vacant
in
their
rooms
come
thronging
soft
and
delicate
desires
all
prompting
me
how
fair
young
hero
is
saying
i
likd
her
ere
i
went
to
wars
thou
wilt
be
like
a
lover
presently
and
tire
the
hearer
with
a
book
of
words
if
thou
dost
love
fair
hero
cherish
it
and
i
will
break
with
her
and
with
her
father
and
thou
shalt
have
her
wast
not
to
this
end
that
thou
beganst
to
twist
so
fine
a
story
how
sweetly
do
you
minister
to
love
that
know
loves
grief
by
his
complexion
but
lest
my
liking
might
too
sudden
seem
i
would
have
salvd
it
with
a
longer
treatise
what
need
the
bridge
much
broader
than
the
flood
the
fairest
grant
is
the
necessity
look
what
will
serve
is
fit
tis
once
thou
lovst
and
i
will
fit
thee
with
the
remedy
i
know
we
shall
have
revelling
tonight
i
will
assume
thy
part
in
some
disguise
and
tell
fair
hero
i
am
claudio
and
in
her
bosom
ill
unclasp
my
heart
and
take
her
hearing
prisoner
with
the
force
and
strong
encounter
of
my
amorous
tale
then
after
to
her
father
will
i
break
and
the
conclusion
is
she
shall
be
thine
in
practice
let
us
put
it
presently
how
now
brother
where
is
my
cousin
your
son
hath
he
provided
this
music
he
is
very
busy
about
it
but
brother
i
can
tell
you
strange
news
that
you
yet
dreaint
not
of
are
they
good
as
the
event
stamps
them
but
they
have
a
good
cover
they
show
well
outward
the
prince
and
count
claudio
walking
in
a
thickpleached
alley
in
my
orchard
were
thus
much
overheard
by
a
man
of
mine
the
prince
discovered
to
claudio
that
he
loved
my
niece
your
daughter
and
meant
to
acknowledge
it
this
night
in
a
dance
and
if
he
found
her
accordant
he
meant
to
take
the
present
time
by
the
top
and
instantly
break
with
you
of
it
hath
the
fellow
any
wit
that
told
you
this
a
good
sharp
fellow
i
will
send
for
him
and
question
him
yourself
no
no
we
will
hold
it
as
a
dream
till
it
appear
itself
but
i
will
acquaint
my
daughter
withal
that
she
may
be
the
better
prepared
for
an
answer
if
peradventure
this
be
true
go
you
and
tell
her
of
it
cousins
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
o
i
cry
you
mercy
friend
go
you
with
me
and
i
will
use
your
skill
good
cousin
have
a
care
this
busy
time
what
the
goodyear
my
lord
why
are
you
thus
out
of
measure
sad
there
is
no
measure
in
the
occasion
that
breeds
therefore
the
sadness
is
without
limit
you
should
hear
reason
and
when
i
have
heard
it
what
blessing
brings
it
it
not
a
present
remedy
at
least
a
patient
sufferance
i
wonder
that
thou
being
as
thou
sayst
thou
art
born
under
saturn
goest
about
to
apply
a
moral
medicine
to
a
mortifying
mischief
i
cannot
hide
what
i
am
i
must
be
sad
when
i
have
cause
and
smile
at
no
mans
jests
eat
when
i
have
stomach
and
wait
for
no
mans
leisure
sleep
when
i
am
drowsy
and
tend
on
no
mans
business
laugh
when
i
am
merry
and
claw
no
man
in
his
humour
yea
but
you
must
not
make
the
full
show
of
this
till
you
may
do
it
without
controlment
you
have
of
late
stood
out
against
your
brother
and
he
hath
taen
you
newly
into
his
grace
where
it
is
impossible
you
should
take
true
root
but
by
the
fair
weather
that
you
make
yourself
it
is
needful
that
you
frame
the
season
for
your
own
harvest
i
had
rather
be
a
canker
in
a
hedge
than
a
rose
in
his
grace
and
it
better
fits
my
blood
to
be
disdained
of
all
than
to
fashion
a
carriage
to
rob
love
from
any
in
this
though
i
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
flattering
honest
man
it
must
not
be
denied
but
i
am
a
plaindealing
villain
i
am
trusted
with
a
muzzle
and
enfranchised
with
a
clog
therefore
i
have
decreed
not
to
sing
in
my
cage
if
i
had
my
mouth
i
would
bite
if
i
had
my
liberty
i
would
do
my
liking
in
the
meantime
let
me
be
that
i
am
and
seek
not
to
alter
me
can
you
make
no
use
of
your
discontent
i
make
all
use
of
it
for
i
use
it
only
who
comes
here
what
news
borachio
i
came
yonder
from
a
great
supper

prince

brother
is
royally
entertained
by
leonato
and
i
can
give
you
intelligence
of
an
intended
marriage
will
it
serve
for
any
model
to
build
mischief
on
what
is
he
for
a
fool
that
betroths
himself
to
unquietness
marry
it
is
your
brothers
right
hand
who

most
exquisite
claudio

proper
squire
and
who
and
who
which
way
looks

hero

daughter
and
heir
of
leonato
a
very
forward
marchchick
how
came

to
this
being
entertained
for
a
perfumer
as
i
was
smoking
a
musty
room
comes
me
the
prince
and
claudio
hand
in
hand
in
sad
conference
i
whipt
me
behind
the
arras
and
there
heard
it
agreed
upon
that
the
prince
should
woo
hero
for
himself
and
having
obtained
her
give
her
to
count
claudio
come
come
let
us
thither
this
may
prove
food
to
my
displeasure
that
young
startup
hath
all
the
glory
of
my
overthrow
if
i
can
cross
him
any
way
i
bless
myself
every
way
you
are
both
sure
and
will
assist
me
to
the
death
my
lord
to
the
death
my
lord
let
us
to
the
great
supper
their
cheer
is
the
greater
that
i
am
subdued
would
the
cook
were
of
my
mind
shall
we
go
prove
whats
to
be
done
well
wait
upon
your
lordship
was
not
count
john
here
at
supper
i
saw
him
not
how
tartly
that
gentleman
looks
i
never
can
see
him
but
i
am
heartburned
an
hour
after
he
is
of
a
very
melancholy
disposition
he
were
an
excellent
man
that
were
made
just
in
the
midway
between
him
and
benedick
the
one
is
too
like
an
image
and
says
nothing
and
the
other
too
like
my
ladys
eldest
son
evermore
tattling
then
half
signior
benedicks
tongue
in
count
johns
mouth
and
half
count
johns
melancholy
in
signior
benedicks
face
with
a
good
leg
and
a
good
foot
uncle
and
money
enough
in
his
purse
such
a
man
would
win
any
woman
in
the
world
if
a
could
get
her
good
will
by
my
troth
niece
thou
wilt
never
get
thee
a
husband
if
thou
be
so
shrewd
of
thy
tongue
in
faith
shes
too
curst
too
curst
is
more
than
curst
i
shall
lessen
gods
sending
that
way
for
it
is
said
god
sends
a
curst
cow
short
horns
but
to
a
cow
too
curst
he
sends
none
so
by
being
too
curst
god
will
send
you
no
horns
just
if
he
send
me
no
husband
for
the
which
blessing
i
am
at
him
upon
my
knees
every
morning
and
evening
lord
i
could
not
endure
a
husband
with
a
beard
on
his
face
i
had
rather
lie
in
the
woollen
you
may
light
on
a
husband
that
hath
no
beard
what
should
i
do
with
him
dress
him
in
my
apparel
and
make
him
my
waitinggentlewoman
he
that
hath
a
beard
is
more
than
a
youth
and
he
that
hath
no
beard
is
less
than
a
man
and
he
that
is
more
than
a
youth
is
not
for
me
and
he
that
is
less
than
a
man
i
am
not
for
him
therefore
i
will
even
take
sixpence
in
earnest
of
the
bearward
and
lead
his
apes
into
hell
well
then
go
you
into
hell
no
but
to
the
gate
and
there
will
the
devil
meet
me
like
an
old
cuckold
with
horns
on
his
head
and
say
get
you
to
heaven
beatrice
get
you
to
heaven
heres
no
place
for
you
maids
so
deliver
i
up
my
apes
and
away
to
saint
peter
for
the
heavens
he
shows
me
where
the
bachelors
sit
and
there
live
we
as
merry
as
the
day
is
long
well
niece
i
trust
you
will
be
ruled
by
your
father
yes
faith
it
is
my
cousins
duty
to
make
curtsy
and
say
father
as
it
please
you
but
yet
for
all
that
cousin
let
him
be
a
handsome
fellow
or
else
make
another
curtsy
and
say
father
as
it
please
me
well
niece
i
hope
to
see
you
one
day
fitted
with
a
husband
not
till
god
make
men
of
some
other
metal
than
earth
would
it
not
grieve
a
woman
to
be
overmastered
with
a
piece
of
valiant
dust
to
make
an
account
of
her
life
to
a
clod
of
wayward
marl
no
uncle
ill
none
adams
sons
are
my
brethren
and
truly
i
hold
it
a
sin
to
match
in
my
kindred
daughter
remember
what
i
told
you
if
the
prince
do
solicit
you
in
that
kind
you
know
your
answer
the
fault
will
be
in
the
music
cousin
if
you
be
not
wooed
in
good
time
if
the
prince
be
too
important
tell
him
there
is
measure
in
everything
and
so
dance
out
the
answer
for
hear
me
hero
wooing
wedding
and
repenting
is
as
a
scotch
jig
a
measure
and
a
cinquepace
the
first
suit
is
hot
and
hasty
like
a
scotch
jig
and
full
as
fantastical
the
wedding
mannerlymodest
as
a
measure
full
of
state
and
ancientry
and
then
comes
repentance
and
with
his
bad
legs
falls
into
the
cinquepace
faster
and
faster
till
he
sink
into
his
grave
cousin
you
apprehend
passing
shrewdly

a
good

i
had
my
good
wit
out
of
the
hundred
merry
tales

this
was
signior
benedick
that
said

i
pray
you
what
is
he
why
he
is
the
princes
jester
a
very
dull
fool
only
his
gift
is
in
devising
impossible
slanders
none
but
libertines
delight
in
him
and
the
commendation
is
not
in
his
wit
but
in
his
villany
for
he
both
pleases
men
and
angers
them
and
then
they
laugh
at
him
and
beat
him
i
am
sure
he
is
in
the
fleet
i
would
he
had
boarded
me
when
i
know
the
gentleman
ill
tell
him
what
you
say
do
do
hell
but
break
a
comparison
or
two
on
me
which
peradventure
not
marked
or
not
laughed
at
strikes
him
into
melancholy
and
then
theres
a
partridge
wing
saved
for
the
fool
will
eat
no
supper
that
night
we
must
follow
the
leaders
in
every
good
thing
nay
if
they
lead
to
any
ill
i
will
leave
them
at
the
next
turning
sure
my
brother
is
amorous
on
hero
and
hath
withdrawn
her
father
to
break
with
him
about
it
the
ladies
follow
her
and
but
one
visor
remains
and

news

for
himself
friendship
is
constant

all
other
things
save
in
the
office
and
affairs
of
love
therefore
all
hearts
in
love
use
their
own
tongues
let
every
eye
negotiate
for
itself
and
trust
no
agent
for
beauty
is
a
witch
against
whose
charms
faith
melteth
into
blood
this
is
an
accident
of
hourly
proof
which
i
mistrusted
not
farewell
therefore
hero
count
claudio
yea
the
same
come
will
you
go
with
me
whither
even
to
the
next
willow
about
your
own
business
count
what
fashion
will
you
wear
the
garland
of
about
your
neck
like
a
usurers
chain
or
under
your
arm
like
a
lieutenants
scarf
you
must
wear
it
one
way
for
the
prince
hath
got
your
hero
i
wish
him
joy
of
her
why
thats
spoken
like
an
honest
drovier
so
they
sell
bullocks
but
did
you
think
the
prince
would
have
served
you
thus
i
pray
you
leave
me
ho
now
you
strike
like
the
blind
man
twas
the
boy
that
stole
your
meat
and
youll
beat
the
post
if
it
will
not
be
ill
leave
you
alas
poor
hurt
fowl
now
will
he
creep
into
sedges
but
that
my
lady
beatrice
should
know
me
and
not
know
me
the
princes
fool
ha
it
may
be
i
go
under
that
title
because
i
am
merry
yea
but
so
i
am
apt
to
do
myself
wrong
i
am
not
so
reputed
it
is
the
base
though
bitter
disposition
of
beatrice
that
puts
the
world
into
her
person
and
so
gives
me
out
well
ill
be
revenged
as
i
may
now
signior
wheres
the
count
did
you
see
him
troth
my
lord
i
have
played
the
part
of
lady
fame
i
found
him
here
as
melancholy
as
a
lodge
in
a
warren
i
told
him
and
i
think
i
told
him
true
that
your
grace
had
got
the
good
will
of
this
young
lady
and
i
offered
him
my
company
to
a
willow
tree
either
to
make
him
a
garland
as
being
forsaken
or
to
bind
him
up
a
rod
as
being
worthy
to
be
whipped
to
be
whipped
whats
his
fault
the
flat
transgression
of
a
schoolboy
who
being
overjoyd
with
finding
a
birds
nest
shows
it
his
companion
and
he
steals
it
wilt
thou
make
a
trust
a
transgression
the
transgression
is
in
the
stealer
yet
it
had
not
been
amiss
the
rod
had
been
made
and
the
garland
too
for
the
garland
he
might
have
worn
himself
and
the
rod
he
might
have
bestowed
on
you
who
as
i
take
it
have
stolen
his
birds
nest
i
will
but
teach
them
to
sing
and
restore
them
to
the
owner
if
their
singing
answer
your
saying
by
my
faith
you
say
honestly
the
lady
beatrice
hath
a
quarrel
to
you
the
gentleman
that
danced
with
her
told
her
she
is
much
wronged
by
you
o
she
misused
me
past
the
endurance
of
a
block
an
oak
but
with
one
green
leaf
on
it
would
have
answered
her
my
very
visor
began
to
assume
life
and
scold
with
her
she
told
me
not
thinking
i
had
been
myself
that
i
was
the
princes
jester
that
i
was
duller
than
a
great
thaw
huddling
jest
upon
jest
with
such
impossible
conveyance
upon
me
that
i
stood
like
a
man
at
a
mark
with
a
whole
army
shooting
at
me
she
speaks
poniards
and
every
word
stabs
if
her
breath
were
as
terrible
as
her
terminations
there
were
no
living
near
her
she
would
infect
to
the
north
star
i
would
not
marry
her
though
she
were
endowed
with
all
that
adam
had
left
him
before
he
transgressed
she
would
have
made
hercules
have
turned
spit
yea
and
have
cleft
his
club
to
make
the
fire
too
come
talk
not
of
her
you
shall
find
her
the
infernal
ate
in
good
apparel
i
would
to
god
some
scholar
would
conjure
her
for
certainly
while
she
is
here
a
man
may
live
as
quiet
in
hell
as
in
a
sanctuary
and
people
sin
upon
purpose
because
they
would
go
thither
so
indeed
all
disquiet
horror
and
perturbation
follow
her
look
here
she
comes
will
your
grace
command
me
any
service
to
the
worlds
end
i
will
go
on
the
slightest
errand
now
to
the
antipodes
that
you
can
devise
to
send
me
on
i
will
fetch
you
a
toothpicker
now
from
the
furthest
inch
of
asia
bring
you
the
length
of
prester
johns
foot
fetch
you
a
hair
off
the
great
chams
beard
do
you
any
embassage
to
the
pigmies
rather
than
hold
three
words
conference
with
this
harpy
you
have
no
employment
for
me
none
but
to
desire
your
good
company
o
god

a
dish

love

cannot
endure

lady

gave
him
use
for
it
a
double
heart

a
single
one

and
not
ever
sad
then
for
i
have
heard
my
daughter

she
hath
often
dreamed
of
unhappiness
and
waked
herself
with
laughing
she
cannot
endure
to
hear
tell
of
a
husband
o
by
no
means
she
mocks
all
her
wooers
out
of

she
were
an
excellent
wife
for

just
sevennight

time
too
brief
too
to
have
all
things
answer
my
mind
come
you
shake
the
head
at
so
long
a
breathing
but
i
warrant
thee
claudio
the
time
shall
not
go
dully
by
us
i
will
in
the
interim
undertake
one
of
hercules
labours
which
is
to
bring
signior
benedick
and
the
lady
beatrice
into
a
mountain
of
affection
the
one
with
the
other
i
would
fain
have
it
a
match
and
i
doubt
not
but
to
fashion
it
if
you
three
will
but
minister
such
assistance
as
i
shall
give
you
direction
my
lord
i
am
for
you
though
it
cost
me
ten
nights
watchings
and
i
my
lord
and
you
too
gentle
hero
i
will
do
any
modest
office
my
lord
to
help
my
cousin
to
a
good
husband
and
benedick
is
not
the
unhopefullest
husband
that
i
know
thus
far
can
i
praise
him
he
is
of
a
noble
strain
of
approved
valour
and
confirmed
honesty
i
will
teach
you
how
to
humour
your
cousin
that
she
shall
fall
in
love
with
benedick
and
i
with
your
two
helps
will
so
practise
on
benedick
that
in
despite
of
his
quick
wit
and
his
queasy
stomach
he
shall
fall
in
love
with
beatrice
if
we
can
do
this
cupid
is
no
longer
an
archer
his
glory
shall
be
ours
for
we
are
the
only
lovegods
go
in
with
me
and
i
will
tell
you
my
drift
it
is
so
the
count
claudio
shall
marry
the
daughter
of
leonato
yea
my
lord
but
i
can
cross
it
any
bar
any
cross
any
impediment
will
be
medicinable
to
me
i
am
sick
in
displeasure
to
him
and
whatsoever
comes
athwart
his
affection
ranges
evenly
with
mine
how
canst
thou
cross
this
marriage
not
honestly
my
lord
but
so
covertly
that
no
dishonesty
shall
appear
in
me
show
me
briefly
how
i
think
i
told
your
lordship
a
year
since
how
much
i
am
in
the
favour
of
margaret
the
waitinggentlewoman
to
hero
i
remember
i
can
at
any
unseasonable
instant
of
the
night
appoint
her
to
look
out
at
her
ladys
chamberwindow
what
life
is
in
that
to
be
the
death
of
this
marriage
the
poison
of
that
lies
in
you
to
temper
go
you
to
the
prince
your
brother
spare
not
to
tell
him
that
he
hath
wronged
his
honour
in
marrying
the
renowned
claudio
whose
estimation
do
you
mightily
hold
up
to
a
contaminated
stale
such
a
one
as
hero
what
proof
shall
i
make
of
that
proof
enough
to
misuse
the
prince
to
vex
claudio
to
undo
hero
and
kill
leonato
look
you
for
any
other
issue
only
to
despite
them
i
will
endeavour
any
thing
go
then
find
me
a
meet
hour
to
draw
don
pedro
and
the
count
claudio
alone
tell
them
that
you
know
that
hero
loves
me
intend
a
kind
of
zeal
both
to
the
prince
and
claudio
as
in
love
of
your
brothers
honour
who
hath
made
this
match
and
his
friends
reputation
who
is
thus
like
to
be
cozened
with
the
semblance
of
a
maid
that
you
have
discovered
thus
they
will
scarcely
believe
this
without
trial
offer
them
instances
which
shall
bear
no
less
likelihood
than
to
see
me
at
her
chamberwindow
hear
me
call
margaret
hero
hear
margaret
term
me
claudio
and
bring
them
to
see
this
the
very
night
before
the
intended
wedding
for
in
the
meantime
i
will
so
fashion
the
matter
that
hero
shall
be
absent
and
there
shall
appear
such
seeming
truth
of
heros
disloyalty
that
jealousy
shall
be
called
assurance
and
all
the
preparation
overthrown
grow
this
to
what
adverse
issue
it
can
i
will
put
it
in
practice
be
cunning
in
the
working
this
and
thy
fee
is
a
thousand
ducats
be
you
constant
in
the
accusation
and
my
cunning
shall
not
shame
me
i
will
presently
go
learn
their
day
of
marriage
boy
signior
in
my
chamberwindow
lies
a
book
bring
it
hither
to
me
in
the
orchard
i
am
here
already
sir
i
know
that
but
i
would
have
thee
hence
and
here
again
exit
boy
i
do
much
wonder
that
one
man
seeing
how
much
another
man
is
a
fool
when
he
dedicates
his
behaviours
to
love
will
after
he
hath
laughed
at
such
shallow
follies
in
others
become
the
argument
of
his
own
scorn
by
falling
in
love
and
such
a
man
is
claudio
i
have
known
when
there
was
no
music
with
him
but
the
drum
and
the
fife
and
now
had
he
rather
hear
the
tabor
and
the
pipe
i
have
known
when
he
would
have
walked
ten
mile
afoot
to
see
a
good
armour
and
now
will
he
lie
ten
nights
awake
carving
the
fashion
of
a
new
doublet
he
was
wont
to
speak
plain
and
to
the
purpose
like
an
honest
man
and
a
soldier
and
now
is
he
turned
orthographer
his
words
are
a
very
fantastical
banquet
just
so
many
strange
dishes
may
i
be
so
converted
and
see
with
these
eyes
i
cannot
tell
i
think
not
i
will
not
be
sworn
but
love
may
transform
me
to
an
oyster
but
ill
take
my
oath
on
it
till
he
have
made
an
oyster
of
me
he
shall
never
make
me
such
a
fool
one
woman
is
fair
yet
i
am
well
another
is
wise
yet
i
am
well
another
virtuous
yet
i
am
well
but
till
all
graces
be
in
one
woman
one
woman
shall
not
come
in
my
grace
rich
she
shall
be
thats
certain
wise
or
ill
none
virtuous
or
ill
never
cheapen
her
fair
or
ill
never
look
on
her
mild
or
come
not
near
me
noble
or
not
i
for
an
angel
of
good
discourse
an
excellent
musician
and
her
hair
shall
be
of
what
colour
it
please
god
ha
the
prince
and
monsieur
love
i
will
hide
me
in
the
arbour
come
shall
we
hear
this
music
yea
my
good
lord
how
still
the
evening
is
as
hushd
on
purpose
to
grace
harmony
see
you
where
benedick
hath
hid
himself
o
very
well
my
lord
the
music
ended
well
fit
the
kidfox
with
a
pennyworth
come
balthazar
well
hear
that
song
again
o
good
my
lord
tax
not
so
bad
a
voice
to
slander
music
any
more
than
once
it
is
the
witness
still
of
excellency
to
put
a
strange
face
on
his
own
perfection
i
pray
thee
sing
and
let
me
woo
no
more
because
you
talk
of
wooing
i
will
sing
since
many
a
wooer
doth
commence
his
suit
to
her
he
thinks
not
worthy
yet
he
woos
yet
will
he
swear
he
loves
nay
pray
thee
come
or
if
thou
wilt
hold
longer
argument
do
it
in
notes
note
this
before
my
notes
theres
not
a
note
of
mine
thats
worth
the
noting
why

very
crotchets

notes
notes
forsooth
and
nothing

chamberwindow
the
best
i
can
my
lord
do
so
farewell
come
hither
leonato
what
was
it
you
told
me
of
today
that
your
niece
beatrice
was
in
love
with
signior
benedick
o
ay
stalk
on
stalk
on
the
fowl
sits
i
did
never
think
that
lady
would
have
loved
any
man
no
nor
i
neither
but
most
wonderful
that
she
should
so
dote
on
signior
benedick
whom
she
hath
in
all
outward
behaviours
seemed
ever
to
abhor
ist
possible
sits
the
wind
in
that
corner
by
my
troth
my
lord
i
cannot
tell
what
to
think
of
it
but
that
she
loves
him
with
an
enraged
affection
it
is
past
the
infinite
of
thought
may
be
she
doth
but
counterfeit
faith
like
enough
o
god
counterfeit
there
was
never
counterfeit
of
passion
came
so
near
the
life
of
passion
as
she
discovers
it
why
what
effects
of
passion
shows
she
bait
the
hook
well
this
fish
will
bite
what
effects
my
lord
she
will
sit
you
you
heard
my
daughter
tell
you
how
she
did
indeed
how
how
i
pray
you
you
amaze
me
i
would
have
thought
her
spirit
had
been
invincible
against
all
assaults
of
affection
i
would
have
sworn
it
had
my
lord
especially
against
benedick
i
should
think
this
a
gull
but
that
the
whitebearded
fellow
speaks
it
knavery
cannot
sure
hide
itself
in
such
reverence
he
hath
taen
the
infection
hold
it
up
hath
she
made
her
affection
known
to
benedick
no
and
swears
she
never
will
thats
her
torment
tis
true
indeed
so
your
daughter
says
shall
i
says
she
that
have
so
oft
encountered
him
with
scorn
write
to
him
that
i
love
him
this
says
she
now
when
she
is
beginning
to
write
to
him
for
shell
be
up
twenty
times
a
night
and
there
will
she
sit
in
her
smock
till
she
have
writ
a
sheet
of
paper
my
daughter
tells
us
all
now
you
talk
of
a
sheet
of
paper
i
remember
a
pretty
jest
your
daughter
told
us
of
o
when
she
had
writ
it
and
was
reading
it
over
she
found
benedick
and
beatrice
between
the
sheet
that
o
she
tore
the
letter
into
a
thousand
halfpence
railed
at
herself
that
she
should
be
so
immodest
to
write
to
one
that
she
knew
would
flout
her
i
measure
him
says
she
by
my
own
spirit
for
i
should
flout
him
if
he
writ
to
me
yea
though
i
love
him
i
should
then
down
upon
her
knees
she
falls
weeps
sobs
beats
her
heart
tears
her
hair
prays
curses
o
sweet
benedick
god
give
me
patience
she
doth
indeed
my
daughter
says
so
and
the
ecstasy
hath
so
much
overborne
her
that
my
daughter
is
sometimes
afeard
she
will
do
a
desperate
outrage
to
herself
it
is
very
true
it
were
good
that
benedick
knew
of
it
by
some
other
if
she
will
not
discover
it
to
what
end
he
would
but
make
a
sport
of
it
and
torment
the
poor
lady
worse
an
he
should
it
were
an
alms
to
hang
him
shes
an
excellent
sweet
lady
and
out
of
all
suspicion
she
is
virtuous
and
she
is
exceeding
wise
in
everything
but
in
loving
benedick
o
my
lord
wisdom
and
blood
combating
in
so
tender
a
body
we
have
ten
proofs
to
one
that
blood
hath
the
victory
i
am
sorry
for
her
as
i
have
just
cause
being
her
uncle
and
her
guardian
i
would
she
had
bestowed
this
dotage
on
me
i
would
have
daffed
all
other
respects
and
made
her
half
myself
i
pray
you
tell
benedick
of
it
and
hear
what
a
will
say
were
it
good
think
you
hero
thinks
surely
she
will
die
for
she
says
she
will
die
if
he
love
her
not
and
she
will
die
ere
she
make
her
love
known
and
she
will
die
if
he
woo
her
rather
than
she
will
bate
one
breath
of
her
accustomed
crossness
she
doth
well
if
she
should
make
tender
of
her
love
tis
very
possible
hell
scorn
it
for
the
man
as
you
know
all
hath
a
contemptible
spirit
he
is
a
very
proper
man
he
hath
indeed
a
good
outward
happiness
fore
god
and
in
my
mind
very
wise
he
doth
indeed
show
some
sparks
that
are
like
wit
and
i
take
him
to
be
valiant
as
hector
i
assure
you
and
in
the
managing
of
quarrels
you
may
say
he
is
wise
for
either
he
avoids
them
with
great
discretion
or
undertakes
them
with
a
most
christianlike
fear
if
he
do
fear
god
a
must
necessarily
keep
peace
if
he
break
the
peace
he
ought
to
enter
into
a
quarrel
with
fear
and
trembling
and
so
will
he
do
for
the
man
doth
fear
god
howsoever
it
seems
not
in
him
by
some
large
jests
he
will
make
well
i
am
sorry
for
your
niece
shall
we
go
seek
benedick
and
tell
him
of
her
love
never
tell
him
my
lord
let
her
wear
it
out
with
good
counsel
nay
thats
impossible
she
may
wear
her
heart
out
first
well
we
will
hear
further
of
it
by
your
daughter
let
it
cool
the
while
i
love
benedick
well
and
i
could
wish
he
would
modestly
examine
himself
to
see
how
much
he
is
unworthy
to
have
so
good
a
lady
my
lord
will
you
walk
dinner
is
ready
if
he
do
not
dote
on
her
upon
this
i
will
never
trust
my
expectation
let
there
be
the
same
net
spread
for
her
and
that
must
your
daughter
and
her
gentlewoman
carry
the
sport
will
be
when
they
hold
one
an
opinion
of
anothers
dotage
and
no
such
matter
thats
the
scene
that
i
would
see
which
will
be
merely
a
dumbshow
let
us
send
her
to
call
him
in
to
dinner
this
can
be
no
trick
the
conference
was
sadly
borne
they
have
the
truth
of
this
from
hero
they
seem
to
pity
the
lady
it
seems
her
affections
have
their
full
bent
love
me
why
it
must
be
requited
i
hear
how
i
am
censured
they
say
i
will
bear
myself
proudly
if
i
perceive
the
love
come
from
her
they
say
too
that
she
will
rather
die
than
give
any
sign
of
affection
i
did
never
think
to
marry
i
must
not
seem
proud
happy
are
they
that
hear
their
detractions
and
can
put
them
to
mending
they
say
the
lady
is
fair
tis
a
truth
i
can
bear
them
witness
and
virtuous
tis
so
i
cannot
reprove
it
and
wise
but
for
loving
me
by
my
troth
it
is
no
addition
to
her
wit
nor
no
great
argument
of
her
folly
for
i
will
be
horribly
in
love
with
her
i
may
chance
have
some
odd
quirks
and
remnants
of
wit
broken
on
me
because
i
have
railed
so
long
against
marriage
but
doth
not
the
appetite
alter
a
man
loves
the
meat
in
his
youth
that
he
cannot
endure
in
his
age
shall
quips
and
sentences
and
these
paper
bullets
of
the
brain
awe
a
man
from
the
career
of
his
humour
no
the
world
must
be
peopled
when
i
said
i
would
die
a
bachelor
i
did
not
think
i
should
live
till
i
were
married
here
comes
beatrice
by
this
day
shes
a
fair
lady
i
do
spy
some
marks
of
love
in
her
against
my
will
i
am
sent
to
bid
you
come
in
to
dinner
fair
beatrice
i
thank
you
for
your
pains
i
took
no
more
pains
for
those
thanks
than
you
take
pains
to
thank
me
if
it
had
been
painful
i
would
not
have
come
you
take
pleasure
then
in
the
message
yea
just
so
much
as
you
may
take
upon
a
knifes
point
and
choke
a
daw
withal
you
have
no
stomach
signior
fare
you
well
ha
against
my
will
i
am
sent
to
bid
you
come
in
to
dinner
theres
a
double
meaning
in
that
i
took
no
more
pains
for
those
thanks
than
you
took
pains
to
thank
me
thats
as
much
as
to
say
any
pains
that
i
take
for
you
is
as
easy
as
thanks
if
i
do
not
take
pity
of
her
i
am
a
villain
if
i
do
not
love
her
i
am
a
jew
i
will
go
get
her
picture
good
margaret
run
thee
to
the
parlour
there
shalt
thou
find
my
cousin
beatrice
proposing
with
the
prince
and
claudio
whisper
her
ear
and
tell
her
i
and
ursula
walk
in
the
orchard
and
our
whole
discourse
is
all
of
her
say
that
thou
overheardst
us
and
bid
her
steal
into
the
pleached
bower
where
honeysuckles
ripend
by
the
sun
forbid
the
sun
to
enter
like
favourites
made
proud
by
princes
that
advance
their
pride
against
that
power
that
bred
it
there
will
she
hide
her
to
listen
our
propose
this
is
thy
office
bear
thee
well
in
it
and
leave
us
alone
ill
make
her
come
i
warrant
you
presently
now
ursula
when
beatrice
doth
come
as
we
do
trace
this
alley
up
and
down
our
talk
must
only
be
of
benedick
when
i
do
name
him
let
it
be
thy
part
to
praise
him
more
than
ever
man
did
merit
my
talk
to
thee
must
be
how
benedick
is
sick
in
love
with
beatrice
of
this
matter
is
little
cupids
crafty
arrow
made
that
only
wounds
by
hearsay
now
begin
for
look
where
beatrice
like
a
lapwing
runs
close
by
the
ground
to
hear
our
conference
the
pleasantst
angling
is
to
see
the
fish
cut
with
her
golden
oars
the
silver
stream
and
greedily
devour
the
treacherous
bait
so
angle
we
for
beatrice
who
even
now
is
couched
in
the
woodbine
coverture
fear
you
not
my
part
of
the
dialogue
then
go
we
near
her
that
her
ear
lose
nothing
of
the
false
sweet
bait
that
we
lay
for
it
no
truly
ursula
she
is
too
disdainful
i
know
her
spirits
are
as
coy
and
wild
as
haggerds
of
the
rock
but
are
you
sure
that
benedick
loves
beatrice
so
entirely
so
says
the
prince
and
my
newtrothed
lord
and
did
they
bid
you
tell
her
of
it
madam
they
did
entreat
me
to
acquaint
her
of
it
but
i
persuaded
them
if
they
lovd
benedick
to
wish
him
wrestle
with
affection
and
never
to
let
beatrice
know
of
it
why
did
you
so
doth
not
the
gentleman
deserve
as
full
as
fortunate
a
bed
as
ever
beatrice
shall
couch
upon
o
god
of
love
i
know
he
doth
deserve
as
much
as
may
be
yielded
to
a
man
but
nature
never
framd
a
womans
heart
of
prouder
stuff
than
that
of
beatrice
disdain
and
scorn
ride
sparkling
in
her
eyes
misprising
what
they
look
on
and
her
wit
values
itself
so
highly
that
to
her
all
matter
else
seems
weak
she
cannot
love
nor
take
no
shape
nor
project
of
affection
she
is
so
selfendeard
sure
i
think
so
and
therefore
certainly
it
were
not
good
she
knew
his
love
lest
she
make
sport
at
it
why
you
speak
truth
i
never
yet
saw
man
how
wise
how
noble
young
how
rarely
featurd
but
she
would
spell
him
backward
if
fairfacd
she
would
swear
the
gentleman
should
be
her
sister
if
black
why
nature
drawing
of
an
antick
made
a
foul
blot
if
tall
a
lance
illheaded
if
low
an
agate
very
vilely
cut
if
speaking
why
a
vane
blown
with
all
winds
if
silent
why
a
block
moved
with
none
so
turns
she
every
man
the
wrong
side
out
and
never
gives
to
truth
and
virtue
that
which
simpleness
and
merit
purchaseth
sure
sure
such
carping
is
not
commendable
no
not
to
be
so
odd
and
from
all
fashions
as
beatrice
is
cannot
be
commendable
but
who
dare
tell
her
so
if
i
should
speak
she
would
mock
me
into
air
o
she
would
laugh
me
out
of
myself
press
me
to
death
with
wit
therefore
let
benedick
like
coverd
fire
consume
away
in
sighs
waste
inwardly
it
were
a
better
death
than
die
with
mocks
which
is
as
bad
as
die
with
tickling
yet
tell
her
of
it
hear
what
she
will
say
no
rather
i
will
go
to
benedick
and
counsel
him
to
fight
against
his
passion
and
truly
ill
devise
some
honest
slanders
to
stain
my
cousin
with
one
doth
not
know
how
much
an
ill
word
may
empoison
liking
o
do
not
do
your
cousin
such
a
wrong
she
cannot
be
so
much
without
true
judgment
having
so
swift
and
excellent
a
wit
as
she
is
prizd
to
have
as
to
refuse
so
rare
a
gentleman
as
signior
benedick
he
is
the
only
man
of
italy
always
excepted
my
dear
claudio
i
pray
you
be
not
angry

fancy
signior

bearing
argument
and
valour

excellent
good

his

a
holy

i
toward
arragon

bring
you
thither
my
lord
if

vouchsafe
me

that
would
be
as
great
a
soil
in
the
new
gloss
of
your
marriage
as
to
show
a
child
his
new
coat
and
forbid
him
to
wear
it
i
will
only
be
bold
with
benedick
for
his
company
for
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot

the
little
hangman

him
he
hath
a
heart

sound
as
a
bell
and
his
tongue
is
the
clapper
for
what
his
heart
thinks
his
tongue
speaks
gallants
i
am
not

theres
no
true
drop
of
blood
in
him
to
be
truly
touched
with
love
if
he
be
sad
he
wants
money
i
have
the
toothache
draw
it
hang
it
you
must
hang
it
first
and
draw
it
afterwards
what
sigh
for
the
toothache
where
is
but
a
humour
or
a
worm
well
every
one
can
master
a
grief
but
he
that
has
it
yet
say
i
he
is
in
love
there
is
no
appearance
of
fancy
in
him
unless
it
be
a
fancy
that
he
hath
to
strange
disguises
as
to
be
a
dutchman
today
a
frenchman
tomorrow
or
in
the
shape
of
two
countries
at
once
as
a
german
from
the
waist
downward
all
slops
and
a
spaniard
from
the
hip
upward
no
doublet
unless
he
have
a
fancy
to
this
foolery
as
it
appears
he
hath
he
is
no
fool
for
fancy
as
you
would
have
it
appear
he
is
if
he
be
not
in
love
with
some
woman
there
is
no
believing
old
signs
a
brushes
his
hat
a
mornings
what
should
that
bode
hath
any
man
seen
him
at
the
barbers
no
but
the
barbers
man
hath
been
seen
with
him
and
the
old
ornament
of
his
cheek
hath
already
stuffed
tennisballs
indeed
he
looks
younger
than
he
did
by
the
loss
of
a
beard
nay
a
rubs
himself
with
civet
can
you
smell
him
out
by
that
thats
as
much
as
to
say
the
sweet
youths
in
love
the
greatest
note
of
it
is
his
melancholy
and
when
was
he
wont
to
wash
his
face
yea
or
to
paint
himself
for
the
which
i
hear
what
they
say
of
him
nay
but
his
jesting
spirit
which
is
now
crept
into
a
lutestring
and
newgoverned
by
stops
indeed
that
tells
a
heavy
tale
for
him
conclude
conclude
he
is
in
love
nay
but
i
know
who
loves
him
that
would
i
know
too
i
warrant
one
that
knows
him
not
yes
and
his
ill
conditions
and
in
despite
of
all
dies
for
him
she
shall
be
buried
with
her
face
upwards
yet
is
this
no
charm
for
the
toothache
old
signior
walk
aside
with
me
i
have
studied
eight
or
nine
wise
words
to
speak
to
you
which
these
hobbyhorses
must
not
hear
for
my
life
to
break
with
him
about
beatrice
tis
even
so
hero
and
margaret
have
by
this
played
their
parts
with
beatrice
and
then
the
two
bears
will
not
bite
one
another
when
they
meet
my
lord
and
brother
god
save
you
good
den
brother
if
your
leisure
served
i
would
speak
with
you
in
private
if
it
please
you
yet
count
claudio
may
hear
for
what
i
would
speak
of
concerns
him
whats
the
matter
means
your
lordship
to
be
married
tomorrow
you
know
he
does
i
know
not
that
when
he
knows
what
i
know
if
there
be
any
impediment
i
pray
you
discover
it
you
may
think
i
love
you
not
let
that
appear
hereafter
and
aim
better
at
me
by
that
i
now
will
manifest
for
my
brother
i
think
he
holds
you
well
and
in
dearness
of
heart
hath
holp
to
effect
your
ensuing
marriage
surely
suit
illspent
and
labour
ill
bestowed
why
whats
the
matter
i
came
hither
to
tell
you
and
circumstances
shortened
for
she
hath
been
too
long
a
talking
of
the
lady
is
disloyal
who
hero
even
she
leonatos
hero
your
hero
every
mans
hero
disloyal
the
words
too
good
to
paint
out
her
wickedness
i
could
say
she
were
worse
think
you
of
a
worse
title
and
i
will
fit
her
to
it
wonder
not
till
further
warrant
go
but
with
me
tonight
you
shall
see
her
chamberwindow
entered
even
the
night
before
her
weddingday
if
you
love
her
then
tomorrow
wed
her
but
it
would
better
fit
your
honour
to
change
your
mind
may
this
be
so
i
will
not
think
it
if
you
dare
not
trust
that
you
see
confess
not
that
you
know
if
you
will
follow
me
i
will
show
you
enough
and
when
you
have
seen
more
and
heard
more
proceed
accordingly
if
i
see
any
thing
tonight
why
i
should
not
marry
her
tomorrow
in
the
congregation
where
i
should
wed
there
will
i
shame
her
and
as
i
wooed
for
thee
to
obtain
her
i
will
join
with
thee
to
disgrace
her
i
will
disparage
her
no
further
till
you
are
my
witnesses
bear
it
coldly
but
till
midnight
and
let
the
issue
show
itself
o
day
untowardly
turned
o
mischief
strangely
thwarting
o
plague
right
well
prevented
so
will
you
say
when
you
have
seen
the
sequel
are
you
good
men
and
true
yea
or
else
it
were
pity
but
they
should
suffer
salvation
body
and
soul
nay
that
were
a
punishment
too
good
for
them
if
they
should
have
any
allegiance
in
them
being
chosen
for
the
princes
watch
well
give
them
their
charge
neighbour
dogberry
first
who
think
you
the
most
desartless
man
to
be
constable
hugh
oatcake
sir
or
george
seacoal
for
they
can
write
and
read
come
hither
neighbour
seacoal
god
hath
blessed
you
with
a
good
name
to
be
a
wellfavoured
man
is
the
gift
of
fortune
but
to
write
and
read
comes
by
nature
both
which
master
constable
you
have
i
knew
it
would
be
your
answer
well
for
your
favour
sir
why
give
god
thanks
and
make
no
boast
of
it
and
for
your
writing
and
reading
let
that
appear
when
there
is
no
need
of
such
vanity
you
are
thought
here
to
be
the
most
senseless
and
fit
man
for
the
constable
of
the
watch
therefore
bear
you
the
lanthorn
this
is
your
charge
you
shall
comprehend
all
vagrom
men
you
are
to
bid
any
man
stand
in
the
princes
name
how
if
a
will
not
stand
why
then
take
no
note
of
him
but
let
him
go
and
presently
call
the
rest
of
the
watch
together
and
thank
god
you
are
rid
of
a
knave
if
he
will
not
stand
when
he
is
bidden
he
is
none
of
the
princes
subjects
true
and
they
are
to
meddle
with
none
but
the
princes
subjects
you
shall
also
make
no
noise
in
the
streets
for
for
the
watch
to
babble
and
to
talk
is
most
tolerable
and
not
to
be
endured
we
will
rather
sleep
than
talk
we
know
what
belongs
to
a
watch
why
you
speak
like
an
ancient
and
most
quiet
watchman
for
i
cannot
see
how
sleeping
should
offend
only
have
a
care
that
your
bills
be
not
stolen
well
you
are
to
call
at
all
the
alehouses
and
bid
those
that
are
drunk
get
them
to
bed
how
if
they
will
not
why
then
let
them
alone
till
they
are
sober
if
they
make
you
not
then
the
better
answer
you
may
say
they
are
not
the
men
you
took
them
for
well
sir
if
you
meet
a
thief
you
may
suspect
him
by
virtue
of
your
office
to
be
no
true
man
and
for
such
kind
of
men
the
less
you
meddle
or
make
with
them
why
the
more
is
for
your
honesty
if
we
know
him
to
be
a
thief
shall
we
not
lay
hands
on
him
truly
by
your
office
you
may
but
i
think
they
that
touch
pitch
will
be
defiled
the
most
peaceable
way
for
you
if
you
do
take
a
thief
is
to
let
him
show
himself
what
he
is
and
steal
out
of
your
company
you
have
been
always
called
a
merciful
man
partner
truly
i
would
not
hang
a
dog
by
my
will
much
more
a
man
who
hath
any
honesty
in
him
if
you
hear
a
child
cry
in
the
night
you
must
call
to
the
nurse
and
bid
her
still
it
how
if
the
nurse
be
asleep
and
will
not
hear
us
why
then
depart
in
peace
and
let
the
child
wake
her
with
crying
for
the
ewe
that
will
not
hear
her
lamb
when
it
baes
will
never
answer
a
calf
when
he
bleats
tis
very
true
this
is
the
end
of
the
charge
you
constable
are
to
present
the
princes
own
person
if
you
meet
the
prince
in
the
night
you
may
stay
him
nay
by
r
lady
that
i
think
a
cannot
five
shillings
to
one
ont
with
any
man
that
knows
the
statues
he
may
stay
him
marry
not
without
the
prince
be
willing
for
indeed
the
watch
ought
to
offend
no
man
and
it
is
an
offence
to
stay
a
man
against
his
will
by
r
lady
i
think
it
be
so
ha
ah
ha
well
masters
good
night
an
there
be
any
matter
of
weight
chances
call
up
me
keep
your
fellows
counsels
and
your
own
and
good
night
come
neighbour
well
masters
we
hear
our
charge
let
us
go
sit
here
upon
the
churchbench
till
two
and
then
all
go
to
bed
one
word
more
honest
neighbours
i
pray
you
watch
about
signior
leonatos
door
for
the
wedding
being
there
tomorrow
there
is
a
great
coil
tonight
adieu
be
vigitant
i
beseech
you
what
conrade
peace
stir
not
conrade
i
say
here
man
i
am
at
thy
elbow
mass
and
my
elbow
itched
i
thought
there
would
a
scab
follow
i
will
owe
thee
an
answer
for
that
and
now
forward
with
thy
tale
stand
thee
close
then
under
this
penthouse
for
it
drizzles
rain
and
i
will
like
a
true
drunkard
utter
all
to
thee
some
treason
masters
yet
stand
close
therefore
know
i
have
earned
of
don
john
a
thousand
ducats
is
it
possible
that
any
villany
should
be
so
dear
thou
shouldst
rather
ask
if
it
were
possible
any
villany
should
be
so
rich
for
when
rich
villains
have
need
of
poor
ones
poor
ones
may
make
what
price
they
will
i
wonder
at
it
that
shows
thou
art
unconfirmed
thou
knowest
that
the
fashion
of
a
doublet
or
a
hat
or
a
cloak
is
nothing
to
a
man
yes
it
is
apparel
i
mean
the
fashion
yes
the
fashion
is
the
fashion
tush
i
may
as
well
say
the
fools
the
fool
but
seest
thou
not
what
a
deformed
thief
this
fashion
is
i
know
that
deformed
a
has
been
a
vile
thief
this
seven
years
a
goes
up
and
down
like
a
gentleman
i
remember
his
name
didst
thou
not
hear
somebody
no
twas
the
vane
on
the
house
seest
thou
not
i
say
what
a
deformed
thief
this
fashion
is
how
giddily
he
turns
about
all
the
hot
bloods
between
fourteen
and
fiveandthirty
sometime
fashioning
them
like
pharaohs
soldiers
in
the
reechy
painting
sometime
like
god
bels
priests
in
the
old
churchwindow
sometime
like
the
shaven
hercules
in
the
smirched
wormeaten
tapestry
where
his
codpiece
seems
as
massy
as
his
club
all
this
i
see
and
i
see
that
the
fashion
wears
out
more
apparel
than
the
man
but
art
not
thou
thyself
giddy
with
the
fashion
too
that
thou
hast
shifted
out
of
thy
tale
into
telling
me
of
the
fashion
not
so
neither
but
know
that
i
have
tonight
wooed
margaret
the
lady
heros
gentlewoman
by
the
name
of
hero
she
leans
me
out
at
her
mistress
chamberwindow
bids
me
a
thousand
times
good
night
i
tell
this
tale
vilely
i
should
first
tell
thee
how
the
prince
claudio
and
my
master
planted
and
placed
and
possessed
by
my
master
don
john
saw
afar
off
in
the
orchard
this
amiable
encounter
and
thought
they
margaret
was
hero
two
of
them
did
the
prince
and
claudio
but
the
devil
my
master
knew
she
was
margaret
and
partly
by
his
oaths
which
first
possessed
them
partly
by
the
dark
night
which
did
deceive
them
but
chiefly
by
my
villany
which
did
confirm
any
slander
that
don
john
had
made
away
went
claudio
enraged
swore
he
would
meet
her
as
he
was
appointed
next
morning
at
the
temple
and
there
before
the
whole
congregation
shame
her
with
what
he
saw
oer
night
and
send
her
home
again
without
a
husband

charge
you
in
the
princes

right
master

dangerous

of
them

to

you
learn

noble
thankfulness
there
leonato
take
her
back
again
give
not
this
rotten
orange
to
your
friend
shes
but
the
sign
and
semblance
of
her
honour
behold
how
like
a
maid
she
blushes
here
o
what
authority
and
show
of
truth
can
cunning
sin
cover
itself
withal
comes
not
that
blood
as
modest
evidence
to
witness
simple
virtue
would
you
not
swear
all
you
that
see
her
that
she
were
a
maid
by
these
exterior
shows
but
she
is
none
she
knows
the
heat
of
a
luxurious
bed
her
blush
is
guiltiness
not
modesty
what
do
you
mean
my
lord
not
to
be
married
not
to
knit
my
soul
to
an
approved
wanton
dear
my
lord
if
you
in
your
own
proof
have
vanquishd
the
resistance
of
her
youth
and
made
defeat
of
her
virginity
i
know
what
you
would
say
if
i
have
known
her
youll
say
she
did
embrace
me
as
a
husband
and
so
extenuate
the
forehand
sin
no
leonato
i
never
tempted
her
with
word
too
large
but
as
a
brother
to
his
sister
showd
bashful
sincerity
and
comely
love
and
seemd
i
ever
otherwise
to
you
out
on
thee
seeming
i
will
write
against
it
you
seem
to
me
as
dian
in
her
orb
as
chaste
as
is
the
bud
ere
it
be
blown
but
you
are
more
intemperate
in
your
blood
than
venus
or
those
pamperd
animals
that
rage
in
savage
sensuality
is
my
lord
well
that
he
doth
speak
so
wide
sweet
prince
why
speak
not
you
what
should
i
speak
i
stand
dishonourd
that
have
gone
about
to
link
my
dear
friend
to
a
common
stale
are
these
things
spoken
or
do
i
but
dream
sir
they
are
spoken
and
these
things
are
true
this
looks
not
like
a
nuptial
true
o

this
is
so
but
what
of
this
my
lord
let
me
but
move
one
question
to
your
daughter
and
by
that
fatherly
and
kindly
power
that
you
have
in
her
bid
her
answer
truly
i
charge
thee

so
as
thou

my
child
o

how
am
i
beset
what
kind
of
catechizing
call

grieved
count

at
that
hour
last
night
talk
with
a
ruffian
at
her
chamberwindow
who
hath
indeed
most
like
a
liberal
villain
confessd
the
vile
encounters
they
have
had
a
thousand
times
in
secret
fie
fie
they
are
not
to

lord

is
not
chastity
enough
in
language
without
offence
to
utter
them
thus
pretty
lady
i
am
sorry
for
thy
much
misgovernment
o
hero
what
a
hero
hadst
thou
been
if
half
thy
outward
graces
had
been
placd
about
thy
thoughts
and
counsels
of
thy
heart
but
fare
thee
well
most
foul
most
fair
farewell
thou
pure
impiety
and
impious
purity
for
thee
ill
lock
up
all
the
gates
of
love
and
on
my
eyelids
shall
conjecture
hang
to
turn
all
beauty
into
thoughts
of
harm
and
never
shall
it
more
be
gracious

a
point
for
me
why
how

wherefore
sink

thus
to
light
smother

uncle
signior
benedick
friar
o
fate
take
not
away
thy
heavy

for
her
shame
that
may
be
wishd
for
how
now
cousin

comfort
lady
dost
thou
look
up
yea
wherefore
should
she
not
wherefore
why

upon
her
could
she
here
deny
the
story
that
is
printed

her
blood
do
not
live
hero
do
not
ope
thine
eyes
for
did
i
think
thou
wouldst
not
quickly
die
thought
i
thy
spirits
were
stronger
than
thy
shames
myself
would
on
the
rearward
of
reproaches
strike
at
thy
life
grievd
i
i
had
but
one
chid
i
for
that
at
frugal
natures
frame
o
one
too
much
by
thee
why
had
i
one
why
ever
wast
thou
lovely
in
mine
eyes
why
had
i
not
with
charitable
hand
took
up
a
beggars
issue
at
my
gates
who
smirched
thus
and
mird
with
infamy
i
might
have
said
no
part
of
it
is
mine
this
shame
derives
itself
from
unknown
loins
but
mine
and
mine
i
lovd
and
mine
i
praisd
and
mine
that
i
was
proud
on
mine
so
much
that
i
myself
was
to
myself
not
mine
valuing
of
her
why
she
o
she
is
fallen
into
a
pit
of
ink
that
the
wide
sea
hath
drops
too
few
to
wash
her
clean
again
and
salt
too
little
which
may
season
give
to
her
foultainted
flesh
sir
sir
be
patient
for
my
part
i
am
so
attird
in
wonder
i
know
not
what
to
say
o
on
my
soul
my
cousin
is
belied
lady
were
you
her
bedfellow
last
night
no
truly
not
although
until
last
night
i
have
this
twelvemonth
been
her
bedfellow
confirmd
confirmd
o
that
is
stronger
made
which
was
before
barrd
up
with
ribs
of
iron
would
the
two
princes
lie
and
claudio
lie
who
lovd
her
so
that
speaking
of
her
foulness
washd
it
with
tears
hence
from
her
let
her
die
hear
me
a
little
for
i
have
only
been
silent
so
long
and
given
way
unto
this
course
of
fortune
by
noting
of
the
lady
i
have
markd
a
thousand
blushing
apparitions
to
start
into
her
face
a
thousand
innocent
shames
in
angel
whiteness
bear
away
those
blushes
and
in
her
eye
there
hath
appeard
a
fire
to
burn
the
errors
that
these
princess
hold
against
her
maiden
truth
call
me
a
fool
trust
not
my
reading
nor
my
observations
which
with
experimental
seal
doth
warrant
the
tenour
of
my
book
trust
not
my
age
my
reverence
calling
nor
divinity
if
this
sweet
lady
lie
not
guiltless
here
under
some
biting
error
friar
it
cannot
be
thou
seest
that
all
the
grace
that
she
hath
left
is
that
she
will
not
add
to
her
damnation
a
sin
of
perjury
she
not
denies
it
why
seekst
thou
then
to
cover
with
excuse
that
which
appears
in
proper
nakedness
lady
what
man
is
he
you
are
accusd
of
they
know
that
do
accuse
me
i
know
none
if
i
know
more
of
any
man
alive
than
that
which
maiden
modesty
doth
warrant
let
all
my
sins
lack
mercy
o
my
father
prove
you
that
any
man
with
me
conversd
at
hours
unmeet
or
that
i
yesternight
maintaind
the
change
of
words
with
any
creature
refuse
me
hate
me
torture
me
to
death
there
is
some
strange
misprision
in
the
princes
two
of
them
have
the
very
bent
of
honour
and
if
their
wisdoms
be
misled
in
this
the
practice
of
it
lives
in
john
the
bastard
whose
spirits
toil
in
frame
of
villanies
i
know
not
if
they
speak
but
truth
of
her
these
hands
shall
tear
her
if
they
wrong
her
honour
the
proudest
of
them
shall
well
hear
of
it
time
hath
not
yet
so
dried
this
blood
of
mine
nor
age
so
eat
up
my
invention
nor
fortune
made
such
havoc
of
my
means
nor
my
bad
life
reft
me
so
much
of
friends
but
they
shall
find
awakd
in
such
a
kind
both
strength
of
limb
and
policy
of
mind
ability
in
means
and
choice
of
friends
to
quit
me
of
them
throughly
pause
awhile
and
let
my
counsel
sway
you
in
this
case
your
daughter
here
the
princes
left
for
dead
let
her
awhile
be
secretly
kept
in
and
publish
it
that
she
is
dead
indeed
maintain
a
mourning
ostentation
and
on
your
familys
old
monument
hang
mournful
epitaphs
and
do
all
rites
that
appertain
unto
a
burial
what
shall
become
of
this
what
will
this
do
marry
this
well
carried
shall
on
her
behalf
change
slander
to
remorse
that
is
some
good
but
not
for
that
dream
i
on
this
strange
course
but
on
this
travail
look
for
greater
birth
she
dying
as
it
must
be
so
maintaind
upon
the
instant
that
she
was
accusd
shall
be
lamented
pitied
and
excusd
of
every
hearer
for
it
so
falls
out
that
what
we
have
we
prize
not
to
the
worth
whiles
we
enjoy
it
but
being
lackd
and
lost
why
then
we
rack
the
value
then
we
find
the
virtue
that
possession
would
not
show
us
whiles
it
was
ours
so
will
it
fare
with
claudio
when
he
shall
hear
she
died
upon
his
words
the
idea
of
her
life
shall
sweetly
creep
into
his
study
of
imagination
and
every
lovely
organ
of
her
life
shall
come
apparelld
in
more
precious
habit
more
movingdelicate
and
full
of
life
into
the
eye
and
prospect
of
his
soul
than
when
she
livd
indeed
then
shall
he
mourn
if
ever
love
had
interest
in
his
liver
and
wish
he
had
not
so
accused
her
no
though
he
thought
his
accusation
true
let
this
be
so
and
doubt
not
but
success
will
fashion
the
event
in
better
shape
than
i
can
lay
it
down
in
likelihood
but
if
all
aim
but
this
be
levelld
false
the
supposition
of
the
ladys
death
will
quench
the
wonder
of
her
infamy
and
if
it
sort
not
well
you
may
conceal
her
as
best
befits
her
wounded
reputation
in
some
reclusive
and
religious
life
out
of
all
eyes
tongues
minds
and
injuries
signior
leonato
let
the
friar
advise
you
and
though
you
know
my
inwardness
and
love
is
very
much
unto
the
prince
and
claudio
yet
by
mine
honour
i
will
deal
in
this
as
secretly
and
justly
as
your
soul
should
with
your
body
being
that
i
flow
in
grief
the
smallest
twine
may
lead
me
tis
well
consented
presently
away
for
to
strange
sores
strangely
they
strain
the
cure
come
lady
die
to
live
this
wedding
day
perhaps
is
but
prolongd
have
patience
and
endure
lady
beatrice
have
you
wept
all
this
while
yea
and
i
will
weep
a
while
longer
i
will
not
desire
that
you
have
no
reason
i
do
it
freely
surely
i
do
believe
your
fair
cousin
is
wronged
ah
how
much
might
the
man
deserve
of
me
that
would
right
her
is
there
any
way
to
show
such
friendship
a
very
even
way
but
no
such
friend
may
a
man
do
it
it
is
a
mans
office
but
not
yours
i
do
love
nothing
in
the
world
so
well
as
you
is
not
that
strange
as
strange
as
the
thing
i
know
not
it
were
as
possible
for
me
to
say
i
loved
nothing
so
well
as
your
but
believe
me
not
and
yet
i
lie
not
i
confess
nothing

thine
enemy
is
he
not
approved
in
the
height
a
villain
that
hath
slandered
scorned
dishonoured
my
kinswoman
o
that
i
were
a
man
what
bear
her
in
hand
until
they
come
to
take
hands
and
then
with
public
accusation
uncovered
slander
unmitigated
rancour
o
god
that
i
were
a
man
i
would
eat
his
heart
in

hear

beatrice
talk
with
a
man
out
at
a
window
a
proper
saying
nay
but
beatrice
sweet
hero
she
is
wronged
she
is
slandered
she
is
undone
beat
princes
and
counties
surely
a
princely
testimony
a
goodly
count
comfect
a
sweet
gallant
surely
o
that
i
were
a
man
for
his
sake
or
that
i
had
any
friend
would
be
a
man
for
my
sake
but
manhood
is
melted
into
curtsies
valour
into
compliment
and
men
are
only
turned
into
tongue
and
trim
ones
too
he
is
now
as
valiant
as
hercules
that
only
tells
a
lie
and
swears
it
i
cannot
be
a
man
with
wishing
therefore
i
will
die
a
woman
with
grieving
tarry
good
beatrice
by
this
hand

am

ass

i
am
an
ass

thou
villain
thou
art
full
of
piety
as
shall
be
proved
upon
thee
by
good
witness
i
am
a
wise
fellow
and
which
is
more
an
officer
and
which
is
more
a
householder
and
which
is
more
as
pretty
a
piece
of
flesh
as
any
in
messina
and
one
that
knows
the
law
go
to
and
a
rich
fellow
enough
go
to
and
a
fellow
that
hath
had
losses
and
one
that
hath
two
gowns
and
everything
handsome
about
him
bring
him
away
o
that
i
had
been
writ
down
an
ass
if
you
go
on
thus
you
will
kill
yourself
and
tis
not
wisdom
thus
to
second
grief
against
yourself
i
pray
thee
cease
thy
counsel
which
falls
into
mine
ears
as
profitless
as
water
in
a
sieve
give
not
me
counsel
nor
let
no
comforter
delight
mine
ear
but
such
a
one
whose
wrongs
do
suit
with
mine
bring
me
a
father
that
so
lovd
his
child
whose
joy
of
her
is
overwhelmd
like
mine
and
bid
him
speak
of
patience
measure
his
woe
the
length
and
breadth
of
mine
and
let
it
answer
every
strain
for
strain
as
thus
for
thus
and
such
a
grief
for
such
in
every
lineament
branch
shape
and
form
if
such
a
one
will
smile
and
stroke
his
beard
bid
sorrow
wag
cry
hem
when
he
should
groan
patch
grief
with
proverbs
make
misfortune
drunk
with
candlewasters
bring
him
yet
to
me
and
i
of
him
will
gather
patience
but
there
is
no
such
man
for
brother
men
can
counsel
and
speak
comfort
to
that
grief
which
they
themselves
not
feel
but
tasting
it
their
counsel
turns
to
passion
which
before
would
give
preceptial
medicine
to
rage
fetter
strong
madness
in
a
silken
thread
charm
ache
with
air
and
agony
with
words
no
no
tis
all
mens
office
to
speak
patience
to
those
that
wring
under
the
load
of
sorrow
but
no
mans
virtue
nor
sufficiency
to
be
so
moral
when
he
shall
endure
the
like
himself
therefore
give
me
no
counsel
my
griefs
cry
louder
than
advertisement
therein
do
men
from
children
nothing
differ
i
pray
thee
peace
i
will
be
flesh
and
blood
for
there
was
never
yet
philosopher
that
could
endure
the
toothache
patiently
however
they
have
writ
the
style
of
gods
and
made
a
push
at
chance
and
sufferance
yet
bend
not
all
the
harm
upon
yourself
make
those
that
do
offend
you
suffer
too
there
thou
speakst
reason
nay
i
will
do
so
my
soul
doth
tell
me
hero
is
belied
and
that
shall
claudio
know
so
shall
the
prince
and
all
of
them
that
thus
dishonour
her

weigh
more
reasons
in
her
balance
nay
an
you

a
cursing
hypocrite

be
looked
to
how

my
lord
officers
what
offence

have
committed
false
report
moreover
they
have
spoken
untruths
secondarily
they
are
slanders
sixth
and
lastly
they
have
belied
a
lady
thirdly
they
have
verified
unjust
things
and
to
conclude
they
are
lying
knaves
first
i
ask
thee
what
they
have
done
thirdly
i
ask
thee
whats
their
offence
sixth
and
lastly
why
they
are
committed
and
to
conclude
what
you
lay
to
their
charge
rightly
reasoned
and
in
his
own
division
and
by
my
troth
theres
one
meaning
well
suited
who
have
you
offended
masters
that
you
are

her
when
you
should
marry
her
my
villany
they
have
upon

which
i
had
rather
seal
with
my
death
than
repeat
over
to
my
shame
the
lady
is
dead
upon
mine
and
my
masters
false
accusation
and
briefly
i
desire
nothing

this
speech
like
iron
through
your
blood
i
have
drunk
poison

a
sonnet
in

my
beauty
in
so
high

pikes
with
a
vice
and
they
are
dangerous
weapons
for
maids
well
i
will
call
beatrice
to
you
who
i
think
hath
legs
and
therefore
will
come
the
god
of
love
that
sits
above
and
knows
me
and
knows
me
how
pitiful
i
deserve
i
mean
in
singing
but
in
loving
leander
the
good
swimmer
troilus
the
first
employer
of
pandars
and
a
whole
book
full
of
these
quondam
carpetmongers
whose
names
yet
run
smoothly
in
the
even
road
of
a
blank
verse
why
they
were
never
so
truly
turned
over
and
over
as
my
poor
self
in
love
marry
i
cannot
show
it
in
rime
i
have
tried
i
can
find
out
no
rime
to
lady
but
baby
an
innocent
rime
for
scorn
horn
a
hard
rime
for
school
fool
a
babbling
rime
very
ominous
endings
no
i
was
not
born
under
a
riming
planet
nor
i
cannot
woo
in
festival
terms
sweet
beatrice
wouldst
thou
come
when
i
called
thee
yea
signior
and
depart
when
you
bid
me
o
stay
but
till
then
then
is
spoken
fare
you
well
now
and
yet
ere
i
go
let
me
go
with
that
i
came
for
which
is
with
knowing
what
hath
passed
between
you
and
claudio
only
foul
words
and
thereupon
i
will
kiss
thee
foul
words
is
but
foul
wind
and
foul
wind
is
but
foul
breath
and
foul
breath
is
noisome
therefore
i
will
depart
unkissed
thou
hast
frighted
the
word
out
of
his
right
sense
so
forcible
is
thy
wit
but
i
must
tell
thee
plainly
claudio
undergoes
my
challenge
and
either
i
must
shortly
hear
from
him
or
i
will
subscribe
him
a
coward
and
i
pray
thee
now
tell
me
for
which
of
my
bad
parts
didst
thou
first
fall
in
love
with
me
for
them
all
together
which
maintained
so
politic
a
state
of
evil
that
they
will
not
admit
any
good
part
to
intermingle
with
them
but
for
which
of
my
good
parts
did
you
first
suffer
love
for
me
suffer
love
a
good
epithet
i
do
suffer
love
indeed
for
i
love
thee
against
my
will
in
spite
of
your
heart
i
think
alas
poor
heart
if
you
spite
it
for
my
sake
i
will
spite
it
for
yours
for
i
will
never
love
that
which
my
friend
hates
thou
and
i
are
too
wise
to
woo
peaceably
it
appears
not
in
this
confession
theres
not
one
wise
man
among
twenty
that
will
praise
himself
an
old
an
old
instance
beatrice
that
lived
in
the
time
of
good
neighbours
if
a
man
do
not
erect
in
this
age
his
own
tomb
ere
he
dies
he
shall
live
no
longer
in
monument
than
the
bell
rings
and
the
widow
weeps
and
how
long
is
that
think
you
question
why
an
hour
in
clamour
and
a
quarter
in
rheum
therefore
it
is
most
expedient
for
the
wise
if
don
worm
his
conscience
find
no
impediment
to
the
contrary
to
be
the
trumpet
of
his
own
virtues
as
i
am
to
myself
so
much
for
praising
myself
who
i
myself
will
bear
witness
is
praiseworthy
and
now

me

doth
your
cousin

ill

what

to
prevent
he
made

by
those
fearful
objects
to
prepare
this

my
unspotted
fire
of

to
you
thus
ready
for
the

of
life
or
death
i
wait
the
sharpest
blow
scorning
advice
read
the
conclusion
then
which
read
and
not
expounded
tis
decreed
as
these
before
thee
thou
thyself
shalt
bleed
of
all
sayd
yet
mayst
thou
prove
prosperous
of
all
sayd
yet
i
wish
thee
happiness
like
a
bold
champion
i
assume
the
lists
nor
ask
advice
of
any
other
thought
but
faithfulness
and
courage
i
am
no
viper
yet
i
feed
on
mothers
flesh
which
did
me
breed
i
sought
a
husband
in
which
labour
i
found
that
kindness
in
a
father
hes
father
son
and
husband
mild
i
mother
wife
and
yet
his
child
how
they
may
be
and
yet
in
two
as
you
will
live
resolve
it
you
sharp
physic
is
the
last
but
o
you
powers
that
give
heaven
countless
eyes
to
view
mens
acts
why
cloud
they
not
their
sights
perpetually
if
this
be
true
which
makes
me
pale
to
read
it
fair
glass
of
light
i
lovd
you
and
could
still
were
not
this
glorious
casket
stord
with
ill
but
i
must
tell
you
now
my
thoughts
revolt
for
hes
no
man
on
whom
perfections
wait
that
knowing
sin
within
will
touch
the
gate
youre
a
fair
viol
and
your
sense
the
strings
who
fingerd
to
make
men
his
lawful
music
would
draw
heaven
down
and
all
the
gods
to
hearken
but
being
playd
upon
before
your
time
hell
only
danceth
at
so
harsh
a
chime
good
sooth
i
care
not
for
you
prince
pericles
touch
not
upon
thy
life
for
thats
an
article
within
our
law
as
dangerous
as
the
rest
your
times
expird
either
expound
now
or
receive
your
sentence
great
king
few
love
to
hear
the
sins
they
love
to
act
twould
braid
yourself
too
near
for
me
to
tell
it
who
has
a
book
of
all
that
monarchs
do
hes
more
secure
to
keep
it
shut
than
shown
for
vice
repeated
is
like
the
wandering
wind
blows
dust
in
others
eyes
to
spread
itself
and
yet
the
end
of
all
is
bought
thus
dear
the
breath
is
gone
and
the
sore
eyes
see
clear
to
stop
the
air
would
hurt
them
the
blind
mole
casts
coppd
hills
towards
heaven
to
tell
the
earth
is
throngd
by
mans
oppression
and
the
poor
worm
doth
die
for
t
kings
are
earths
gods
in
vice
their
laws
their
will
and
if
jove
stray
who
dares
say
jove
doth
ill
it
is
enough
you
know
and
it
is
fit
what
being
more
known
grows
worse
to
smother
it
all
love
the
womb
that
their
first
being
bred
then
give
my
tongue
like
leave
to
love
my
head
heaven
that
i
had
thy
head
he
has
found
the
meaning
but
i
will
gloze
with
him
young
prince
of
tyre
though
by
the
tenour
of
our
strict
edict
your
exposition
misinterpreting
we
might
proceed
to
cancel
of
your
days
yet
hope
succeeding
from
so
fair
a
tree
as
your
fair
self
doth
tune
us
otherwise
forty
days
longer
we
do
respite
you
if
by
which
time
our
secret
be
undone
this
mercy
shows
well
joy
in
such
a
son
and
until
then
your
entertain
shall
be
as
doth
befit
our
honour
and
your
worth
how
courtesy
would
seem
to
cover
sin
when
what
is
done
is
like
a
hypocrite
the
which
is
good
in
nothing
but
in
sight
if
it
be
true
that
i
interpret
false
then
were
it
certain
you
were
not
so
bad
as
with
foul
incest
to
abuse
your
soul
where
now
youre
both
a
father
and
a
son
by
your
untimely
claspings
with
your
child
which
pleasure
fits
a
husband
not
a
father
and
she
an
eater
of
her
mothers
flesh
by
the
defiling
of
her
parents
bed
and
both
like
serpents
are
who
though
they
feed
on
sweetest
flowers
yet
they
poison
breed
antioch
farewell
for
wisdom
sees
those
men
blush
not
in
actions
blacker
than
the
night
will
shun
no
course
to
keep
them
from
the
light
one
sin
i
know
another
doth
provoke
murders
as
near
to
lust
as
flame
to
smoke
poison
and
treason
are
the
hands
of
sin
ay
and
the
targets
to
put
off
the
shame
then
lest
my
life
be
croppd
to
keep
you
clear
by
flight
ill
shun
the
danger
which
i
fear
he
hath
found
the
meaning
for
which
we
mean
to
take
his
head
he
must
not
live
to
trumpet
forth
my
infamy
nor
tell
the
world
antiochus
doth
sin
in
such
a
loathed
manner
and
therefore
instantly
this
prince
must
die
for
by
his
fall
my
honour
must
keep
high
who
attends
us
there
doth
your
highness
call
thaliard
youre
of
our
chamber
and
our
mind
partakes
her
private
actions
to
your
secrecy
and
for
your
faithfulness
we
will
advance
you
thaliard
behold
heres
poison
and
heres
gold
we
hate
the
prince
of
tyre
and
thou
must
kill
him
it
fits
thee
not
to
ask
the
reason
why
because
we
bid
it
say
is
it
done
my
lord
tis
done
enough
let
your
breath
cool
yourself
telling
your
haste
my
lord
prince
pericles
is
fled
as
thou
wilt
live
fly
after
and
as
an
arrow
shot
from
a
wellexperiencd
archer
hits
the
mark
his
eye
doth
level
at
so
thou
neer
return
unless
thou
say
prince
pericles
is
dead
my
lord
if
i
can
get
him
within
my
pistols
length
ill
make
him
sure
enough
so
farewell
to
your
highness
thaliard
adieu
till
pericles
be
dead
my
heart
can
lend
no
succour
to
my
head
let
none
disturb
us
why
should
this
change
of
thoughts
the
sad
companion
dulleyd
melancholy
be
my
so
usd
a
guest
as
not
an
hour
in
the
days
glorious
walk
or
peaceful
night
the
tomb
where
grief
should
sleep
can
breed
me
quiet
here
pleasures
court
mine
eyes
and
mine
eyes
shun
them
and
danger
which
i
feared
is
at
antioch
whose
arm
seems
far
too
short
to
hit
me
here
yet
neither
pleasures
art
can
joy
my
spirits
nor
yet
the
others
distance
comfort
me
then
it
is
thus
the
passions
of
the
mind
that
have
their
first
conception
by
misdread
have
afternourishment
and
life
by
care
and
what
was
first
but
fear
what
might
be
done
grows
elder
now
and
cares
it
be
not
done
and
so
with
me
the
great
antiochus
gainst
whom
i
am
too
little
to
contend
since
hes
so
great
can
make
his
will
his
act
will
think
me
speaking
though
i
swear
to
silence
nor
boots
it
me
to
say
i
honour
him
if
he
suspect
i
may
dishonour
him
and
what
may
make
him
blush
in
being
known
hell
stop
the
course
by
which
it
might
be
known
with
hostile
forces
hell
oerspread
the
land
and
with
the
ostent
of
war
will
look
so
huge
amazement
shall
drive
courage
from
the
state
our
men
be
vanquishd
ere
they
do
resist
and
subjects
punishd
that
neer
thought
offence
which
care
of
them
not
pity
of
myself
who
am
no
more
but
as
the
tops
of
trees
which
fence
the
roots
they
grow
by
and
defend
them
make
both
my
body
pine
and
soul
to
languish
and
punish
that
before
that
he
would
punish
joy
and
all
comfort
in
your
sacred
breast
and
keep
your
mind
till
you
return
to
us
peaceful
and
comfortable
peace
peace
and
give
experience
tongue
they
do
abuse
the
king
that
flatter
him
for
flattery
is
the
bellows
blows
up
sin
the
thing
the
which
is
flatterd
but
a
spark
to
which
that
blast
gives
heat
and
stronger
glowing
whereas
reproof
obedient
and
in
order
fits
kings
as
they
are
men
for
they
may
err
when
signior
sooth
here
does
proclaim
a
peace
he
flatters
you
makes
war
upon
your
life
prince
pardon
me
or
strike
me
if
you
please
i
cannot
be
much
lower
than
my
knees
all
leave
us
else
but
let
your
cares
oerlook
what
shipping
and
what
ladings
in
our
haven
and
then
return
to
us
helicanus
thou
hast
movd
us
what
seest
thou
in
our
looks
an
angry
brow
dread
lord
if
there
be
such
a
dart
in
princes
frowns
how
durst
thy
tongue
move
anger
to
our
face
how
dare
the
plants
look
up
to
heaven
from
whence
they
have
their
nourishment
thou
knowst
i
have
power
to
take
thy
life
from
thee
i
have
ground
the
axe
myself
do
you
but
strike
the
blow
rise
prithee
rise
sit
down
thou
art
no
flatterer
i
thank
thee
for
it
and
heaven
forbid
that
kings
should
let
their
ears
hear
their
faults
hid
fit
counsellor
and
servant
for
a
prince
who
by
thy
wisdom
makst
a
prince
thy
servant
what
wouldst
thou
have
me
do
to
bear
with
patience
such
griefs
as
you
yourself
do
lay
upon
yourself
thou
speakst
like
a
physician
helicanus
that
ministerst
a
potion
unto
me
that
thou
wouldst
tremble
to
receive
thyself
attend
me
then
i
went
to
antioch
where
as
thou
knowst
against
the
face
of
death
i
sought
the
purchase
of
a
glorious
beauty
from
whence
an
issue
i
might
propagate
are
arms
to
princes
and
bring
joys
to
subjects
her
face
was
to
mine
eye
beyond
all
wonder
the
rest
hark
in
thine
ear
as
black
as
incest
which
by
my
knowledge
found
the
sinful
father
seemd
not
to
strike
but
smooth
but
thou
knowst
this
tis
time
to
fear
when
tyrants
seem
to
kiss
which
fear
so
grew
in
me
i
hither
fled
under
the
covering
of
a
careful
night
who
seemd
my
good
protector
and
being
here
bethought
me
what
was
past
what
might
succeed
i
knew
him
tyrannous
and
tyrants
fears
decrease
not
but
grow
faster
than
the
years
and
should
he
doubt
it
as
no
doubt
he
doth
that
i
should
open
to
the
listening
air
how
many
worthy
princes
bloods
were
shed
to
keep
his
bed
of
blackness
unlaid
ope
to
lop
that
doubt
hell
fill
this
land
with
arms
and
make
pretence
of
wrong
that
i
have
done
him
when
all
for
mine
if
i
may
call
t
offence
must
feel
wars
blow
who
spares
not
innocence
which
love
to
all
of
which
thyself
art
one
who
now
reprovst
me
for
it
alas
sir
drew
sleep
out
of
mine
eyes
blood
from
my
cheeks
musings
into
my
mind
with
thousand
doubts
how
i
might
stop
this
tempest
ere
it
came
and
finding
little
comfort
to
relieve
them
i
thought
it
princely
charity
to
grieve
them
well
my
lord
since
you
have
given
me
leave
to
speak
freely
will
i
speak
antiochus
you
fear
and
justly
too
i
think
you
fear
the
tyrant
who
either
by
public
war
or
private
treason
will
take
away
your
life
therefore
my
lord
go
travel
for
a
while
till
that
his
rage
and
anger
be
forgot
or
till
the
destinies
do
cut
his
thread
of
life
your
rule
direct
to
any
if
to
me
day
serves
not
light
more
faithful
than
ill
be
i
do
not
doubt
thy
faith
but
should
he
wrong
my
liberties
in
my
absence
well
mingle
our
bloods
together
in
the
earth
from
whence
we
had
our
being
and
our
birth
tyre
i
now
look
from
thee
then
and
to
tarsus
intend
my
travel
where
ill
hear
from
thee
and
by
whose
letters
ill
dispose
myself
the
care
i
had
and
have
of
subjects
good
on
thee
ill
lay
whose
wisdoms
strength
can
bear
it
ill
take
thy
word
for
faith
not
ask
thine
oath
who
shuns
not
to
break
one
will
sure
crack
both
but
in
our
orbs
well
live
so
round
and
safe
that
time
of
both
this
truth
shall
neer
convince
thou
showdst
a
subjects
shine
i
a
true
prince
so
this
is
tyre
and
this
the
court
here
must
i
kill
king
pericles
and
if
i
do
not
i
am
sure
to
be
hanged
at
home
tis
dangerous
well
i
perceive
he
was
a
wise
fellow
and
had
good
discretion
that
being
bid
to
ask
what
he
would
of
the
king
desired
he
might
know
none
of
his
secrets
now
do
i
see
he
had
some
reason
for
it
for
if
a
king
bid
a
man
be
a
villain
he
is
bound
by
the
indenture
of
his
oath
to
be
one
hush
here
come
the
lords
of
tyre
you
shall
not
need
my
fellow
peers
of
tyre
further
to
question
me
of
your
kings
departure
his
seald
commission
left
in
trust
with
me
doth
speak
sufficiently
hes
gone
to
travel
how
the
king
gone
if
further
yet
you
will
be
satisfied
why
as
it
were
unlicensd
of
your
loves
he
would
depart
ill
give
some
light
unto
you
being
at
antioch
what
from
antioch
royal
antiochus
on
what
cause
i
know
not
took
some
displeasure
at
him
at
least
he
judgd
so
and
doubting
lest
that
he
had
errd
or
sinnd
to
show
his
sorrow
hed
correct
himself
so
puts
himself
unto
the
shipmans
toil
with
whom
each
minute
threatens
life
or
death
well
i
perceive
i
shall
not
be
hangd
now
although
i
would
but
since
hes
gone
the
king
it
sure
must
please
he
scapd
the
land
to
perish
at
the
sea
ill
present
myself
peace
to
the
lords
of
tyre
lord
thaliard
from
antiochus
is
welcome
from
him
i
come
with
message
unto
princely
pericles
but
since
my
landing
i
have
understood
your
lord
hath
betook
himself
to
unknown
travels
my
message
must
return
from
whence
it
came
we
have
no
reason
to
desire
it
commended
to
our
master
not
to
us
yet
ere
you
shall
depart
this
we
desire
as
friends
to
antioch
we
may
feast
in
tyre
my
dionyza
shall
we
rest
us
here
and
by
relating
tales
of
others
griefs
see
if
twill
teach
us
to
forget
our
own
that
were
to
blow
at
fire
in
hope
to
quench
it
for
who
digs
hills
because
they
do
aspire
throws
down
one
mountain
to
cast
up
a
higher
o
my
distressed
lord
even
such
our
griefs
are
here
theyre
but
felt
and
seen
with
mischiefs
eyes
but
like
to
groves
being
toppd
they
higher
rise
o
dionyza
who
wanteth
food
and
will
not
say
he
wants
it
or
can
conceal
his
hunger
till
he
famish
our
tongues
and
sorrows
do
sound
deep
our
woes
into
the
air
our
eyes
do
weep
till
tongues
fetch
breath
that
may
proclaim
them
louder
that
if
heaven
slumber
while
their
creatures
want
they
may
awake
their
helps
to
comfort
them
ill
then
discourse
our
woes
felt
several
years
and
wanting
breath
to
speak
help
me
with
tears
ill
do
my
best
sir
this
tarsus
oer
which
i
have
the
government
a
city
on
whom
plenty
held
full
hand
for
riches
strewd
herself
even
in
the
streets
whose
towers
bore
heads
so
high
they
kissd
the
clouds
and
strangers
neer
beheld
but
wonderd
at
whose
men
and
dames
so
jetted
and
adornd
like
one
anothers
glass
to
trim
them
by
their
tables
were
stord
full
to
glad
the
sight
and
not
so
much
to
feed
on
as
delight
all
poverty
was
scornd
and
pride
so
great
the
name
of
help
grew
odious
to
repeat
o
tis
too
true
but
see
what
heaven
can
do
by
this
our
change
these
mouths
whom
but
of
late
earth
sea
and
air
were
all
too
little
to
content
and
please
although
they
gave
their
creatures
in
abundance
as
houses
are
defild
for
want
of
use
they
are
now
starvd
for
want
of
exercise
those
palates
who
not
yet
two
summers
younger
must
have
inventions
to
delight
the
taste
would
now
be
glad
of
bread
and
beg
for
it
those
mothers
who
to
nousle
up
their
babes
thought
nought
too
curious
are
ready
now
to
eat
those
little
darlings
whom
they
lovd
so
sharp
are
hungers
teeth
that
man
and
wife
draw
lots
who
first
shall
die
to
lengthen
life
here
stands
a
lord
and
there
a
lady
weeping
here
many
sink
yet
those
which
see
them
fall
have
scarce
strength
left
to
give
them
burial
is
not
this
true
our
cheeks
and
hollow
eyes
do
witness
it
o
let
those
cities
that
of
plentys
cup
and
her
prosperities
so
largely
taste
with
their
superfluous
riots
hear
these
tears
the
misery
of
tarsus
may
be
theirs
wheres
the
lord
governor
here
speak
out
thy
sorrows
which
thou
bringst
in
haste
for
comfort
is
too
far
for
us
to
expect
we
have
descried
upon
our
neighbouring
shore
a
portly
sail
of
ships
make
hitherward
i
thought
as
much
one
sorrow
never
comes
but
brings
an
heir
that
may
succeed
as
his
inberitor
and
so
in
ours
some
neighbouring
nation
taking
advantage
of
our
misery
hath
stuffd
these
hollow
vessels
with
their
power
to
beat
us
down
the
which
are
down
already
and
make
a
conquest
of
unhappy
me
whereas
no
glorys
got
to
overcome
thats
the
least
fear
for
by
the
semblance
of
their
white
flags
displayd
they
bring
us
peace
and
come
to
us
as
favourers
not
as
foes
thou
speakst
like
him
s
untutord
to
repeat
who
makes
the
fairest
show
means
most
deceit
but
bring
they
what
they
will
and
what
they
can
what
need
we
fear
the
grounds
the
lowest
and
we
are
half
way
there
go
tell
their
general
we
attend
him
here
to
know
for
what
he
comes
and
whence
he
comes
and
what
he
craves
i
go
my
lord
welcome
is
peace
if
he

peace

unable
to

cease

you
angry
stars
of

remember
earthly
man
is
but
a
substance
that
must
yield
to
you
and
i
as
fits
my
nature
do
obey
you
alas
the
sea
hath
cast
me
on
the
rocks
washd
me
from
shore
to
shore
and
left
me
breath
nothing
to
think
on
but
ensuing
death
let
it
suffice
the
greatness
of
your
powers
to
have
bereft
a
prince
of
all
his
fortunes
and
having
thrown
him
from
your
watery
grave
here
to
have
death
in
peace
is
all
hell
crave
what
ho
pilch
ha
come
and
bring
away
the
nets
what
patchbreech
i
say
what
say
you
master
look
how
thou
stirrest
now
come
away
or
ill
fetch
thee
with
a
wannion
faith
master
i
am
thinking
of
the
poor
men
that
were
cast
away
before
us
even
now
alas
poor
souls
it
grieved
my
heart
to
hear
what
pitiful
cries
they
made
to
us
to
help
them
when
welladay
we
could
scarce
help
ourselves
nay
master
said
not
i
as
much
when
i
saw
the
porpus
how
he
bounced
and
tumbled
they
say
theyre
half
fish
half
flesh
a
plague
on
them
they
neer
come
but
i
look
to
be
washed
master
i
marvel
how
the
fishes
live
in
the
sea
why
as
men
do
aland
the
great
ones
eat
up
the
little
ones
i
can
compare
our
rich
misers
to
nothing
so
fitly
as
to
a
whale
a
plays
and
tumbles
driving
the
poor
fry
before
him
and
at
last
devours
them
all
at
a
mouthful
such
whales
have
i
heard
on
o
the
land
who
never
leave
gaping
till
theyve
swallowed
the
whole
parish
church
steeple
bells
and
all
a
pretty
moral
but
master
if
i
had
been
the
sexton
i
would
have
been
that
day
in
the
belfry
why
man
because
he
should
have
swallowed
me
too
and
when
i
had
been
in
his
belly
i
would
have
kept
such
a
jangling
of
the
bells
that
he
should
never
have
left
till
he
cast
bells
steeple
church
and
parish
up
again
but
if
the
good
king
simonides
were
of
my
mind
simonides
we
would
purge
the
land
of
these
drones
that
rob
the
bee
of
her
honey
how
from
the
finny
subject
of
the
sea
these
fishers
tell
the
infirmities
of
men
and
from
their
watery
empire
recollect
all
that
may
men
approve
or
men
detect
peace
be
at
your
labour
honest
fishermen
honest
good
fellow

that
if
it
be
a
day
fits

search
out
of
the
calendar
and
nobody
look
after
it
y
may
see
the
sea
hath
cast
me
on
your
coast
what
a
drunken
knave
was
the
sea
to
cast
thee
in
our
way
a
man
whom
both
the
waters
and
the
wind
in
that
vast
tenniscourt

made
the
ball
for

my
commendations
great
whose

tis
fit
it
should
be
so
for
princes

a
model
which
heaven
makes
like
to

as
jewels

their
glory
if
neglected
so
princes
their
renowns
if
not
respected
tis
now
your
honour
daughter
to
explain
the
labour
of
each
knight
in
his
device
which
to
preserve
mine
honour
ill
perform
who
is
the
first
that
doth
prefer
himself
a
knight
of
sparta
my
renowned
father
and
the
device
he
bears
upon
his
shield
is
a
black
ethiop
reaching
at
the
sun
the
word
lux
tua
vita
mihi
he
loves
you
well
that
holds
his
life
of
you
who
is
the
second
that
presents
himself
a
prince
of
macedon
my
royal
father
and
the
device
he
bears
upon
his
shield
is
an
armd
knight
thats
conquerd
by
a
lady
the
motto
thus
in
spanish
piu
por
dulzura
que
por
fuerza
and
whats
the
third
the
third
of
antioch
and
his
device
a
wreath
of
chivalry
the
word
me
pomp
provexit
apex
what
is
the
fourth
a
burning
torch
thats
turned
upside
down
the
word
quod
me
alit
me
extinguit
which
shows
that
beauty
hath
his
power
and
will
which
can
as
well
inflame
as
it
can
kill
the
fifth
a
hand
environed
with
clouds
holding
out
gold
thats
by
the
touchstone
tried
the
motto
thus
sic
spectanda
fides
and
what
s
the
sixth
and
last
the
which
the
knight
himself
with
such
a
graceful
courtesy
deliverd
he
seems
to
be
a
stranger
but
his
present
is
a
witherd
branch
thats
only
green
at
top
the
motto
in
hac
spe
vivo
a
pretty
moral
from
the
dejected
state
wherein
he
is
he
hopes
by
you
his
fortune
yet
may
flourish
he
had
need
mean
better
than
his
outward
show
can
any
way
speak
in
his
just
commend
for
by
his
rusty
outside
he
appears
to
have
practisd
more
the
whipstock
than
the
lance
he
well
may
be
a
stranger
for
he
comes
to
an
honourd
triumph
strangely
furnished
and
on
set
purpose
let
his
armour
rust
until
this
day
to
scour
it
in
the
dust
opinions
but
a
fool
that
makes
us
scan
the
outward
habit
by
the
inward
man
but
stay
the
knights
are
coming
well
withdraw
into
the
gallery
knights
to
say
youre
welcome
were
superfluous
to
place
upon
the
volume
of
your
deeds
as
in
a
titlepage
your
worth
in
arms
were
more
than
you
expect
or
more
thans
fit
since
every
worth
in
show
commends
itself
prepare
for
mirth
for
mirth
becomes
a
feast
you
are
princes
and
my
guests
but
you
my
knight
and
guest
to
whom
this
wreath
of
victory
i
give
and
crown
you
king
of
this
days
happiness
tis
more
by
fortune
lady
than
by
merit
call
it
by
what
you
will
the
day
is
yours
and
here
i
hope
is
none
that
envies
it
in
framing
an
artist
art
hath
thus
decreed
to
make
some
good
but
others
to
exceed
and
youre
her
labourd
scholar
come
queen
o
the
feast
for
daughter
so
you
are
here
take
your
place
marshal
the
rest
as
they
deserve
their
grace
we
are
honourd
much
by
good
simonides
your
presence
glads
our
days
honour
we
love
for
who
hates
honour
hates
the
gods
above
sir
yonder
is
your
place
some
other
is
more
fit
contend
not
sir
for
we
are
gentlemen
that
neither
in
our
hearts
nor
outward
eyes
envy
the
great
nor
do
the
low
despise
you
are
right
courteous
knights
sit
sir
sit
by
jove
i
wonder
that
is
king
of
thoughts
these
cates
resist
me
she
but
thought
upon
by
juno
that
is
queen
of
marriage
all
viands
that
i
eat
do
seem
unsavoury
wishing
him
my
meat
sure
hes
a
gallant
gentleman
hes
but
a
country
gentleman
he
has
done
no
more
than
other
knights
have
done
he
has
broken
a
staff
or
so
so
let
it
pass
to
me
he
seems
like
diamond
to
glass
yon
kings
to
me
like
to
my
fathers
picture
which
tells
me
in
that
glory
once
he
was
had
princes
sit
like
stars
about
his
throne
and
he
the
sun
for
them
to
reverence
none
that
beheld
him
but
like
lesser
lights
did
vail
their
crowns
to
his
supremacy
where
now
his
sons
like
a
glowworm
in
the
night
the
which
hath
fire
in
darkness
none
in
light
whereby
i
see
that
times
the
king
of
men
hes
both
their
parent
and
he
is
their
grave
and
gives
them
what
he
will
not
what
they
crave
what
are
you
merry
knights
who
can
be
other
in
this
royal
presence
here
with
a
cup
thats
stord
unto
the
brim
as
you
do
love
fill
to
your
mistress
lips
we
drink
this
health
to
you
we
thank
your
grace
yet
pause
awhile
yon
knight
doth
sit
too
melancholy
as
if
the
entertainment
in
our
court
had
not
a
show
might
countervail
his
worth
note
it
not
you
thaisa
what
is
it
to
me
my
father
o
attend
my
daughter
princes
in
this
should
live
like
gods
above
who
freely
give
to
every
one
that
comes
to
honour
them
and
princes
not
doing
so
are
like
to
gnats
which
make
a
sound
but
killd
are
wonderd
at
therefore
to
make
his
entrance
more
sweet
here
say
we
drink
this
standingbowl
of
wine
to
him
alas
my
father
it
befits
not
me
unto
a
stranger
knight
to
be
so
bold
he
may
my
proffer
take
for
an
offence
since
men
take
womens
gifts
for
impudence
how
do
as
i
bid
you
or
youll
move
me
else
now
by
the
gods
he
could
not
please
me
better
and
further
tell
him
we
desire
to
know
of
him
of
whence
he
is
his
name
and
parentage

much
blood

gentleman
of
tyre

in
arts
and
arms
who
looking
for
adventures
in
the
world
was
by
the
rough
seas
reft
of
ships
and
men
and
after
shipwrack
driven
upon
this
shore
he
thanks
your
grace

pericles
a
gentleman
of
tyre
who

by
misfortune

the
seas

of
ships
and
men

on
this
shore
now
by
the
gods
i
pity
his
misfortune
and
will
awake
him
from
his
melancholy
come
gentlemen
we
sit
too
long
on
trifles
and
waste
the
time
which
looks
for
other
revels
even
in
your
armours
as
you
are
addressd
will
very
well
become
a
soldiers
dance
i
will
not
have
excuse
with
saying
this
loud
music
is
too
harsh
for
ladies
heads
since
they
love
men
in
arms
as
well
as
beds
so
this
was
well
askd
twas
so
well
performd
come
sir
here
is
a
lady
that
wants
breathing
too
and
i
have
often
heard
you
knights
of
tyre
are
excellent
in
making
ladies
trip
and
that
their
measures
are
as
excellent
in
those
that
practise
them
they
are
my
lord
o
thats
as
much
as
you
would
be
denied
of
your
fair
courtesy

unclasp
thanks

of
me
antiochus
from
incest
livd
not
free
for
which
the
most
high
gods
not
minding
longer
to
withhold
the
vengeance
that
they
had
in
store
due
to
this
heinous
capital
offence
even
in
the
height
and
pride
of
all
his
glory
when
he
was
seated
in
a
chariot
of
an
inestimable
value
and
his
daughter
with
him
a
fire
from
heaven
came
and
shrivelld
up
their
bodies
even
to
loathing
for
they
so
stunk
that
all
those
eyes
adord
them
ere
their
fall
scorn
now
their
hand
should
give
them
burial
twas
very
strange
and
yet
but
just
for
though
this
king
were
great
his
greatness
was
no
guard
to
bar
heavens
shaft
but
sin
had
his
reward
tis
very
true
see
not
a
man
in
private
conference
or
council
has
respect
with
him
but
he
it
shall
no
longer
grieve
without
reproof
and
cursd
be
he
that
will
not
second
it
follow
me
then
lord
helicane
a
word
with
me
and
welcome
happy
day
my
lords
know
that
our
griefs
are
risen
to
the
top
and
now
at
length
they
overflow
their
banks
your
griefs
for
what
wrong
not
the
prince
you
love
wrong
not
yourself
then
noble
helicane
but
if
the
prince
do
live
let
us
salute
him
or
know
what
grounds
made
happy
by
his
breath
if
in
the
world
he
live
well
seek
him
out
if
in
his
grave
he
rest
well
find
him
there
and
be
resolvd
he
lives
to
govern
us
or
dead
give
s
cause
to
mourn
his
funeral
and
leaves
us
to
our
free
election
whose
deaths
indeed
the
strongest
in
our
censure
and
knowing
this
kingdom
is
without
a
head
like
goodly
buildings
left
without
a
roof
soon
fall
to
ruin
your
noble
self
that
best
knowst
how
to
rule
and
how
to
reign
we
thus
submit
unto
our
sovereign
live
noble
helicane
for
honours
cause
forbear
your
suffrages
if
that
you
love
prince
pericles

i
your
wish

leap
into
the
seas
wheres
hourly
trouble
for
a
minutes
ease

twelvemonth
longer

me
entreat
you
to
forbear
the
absence
of
your
king
if
in
which
time
expird

shall
with
aged
patience
bear
your
yoke
but
if
i
cannot
win
you
to
this
love
go
search
like
nobles
like
noble
subjects
and
in
your
search
spend
your
adventurous
worth
whom
if
you
find
and
win
unto
return
you
shall
like
diamonds
sit
about
his
crown
to
wisdom
hes
a
fool
that

not
yield
and

scholars
my
good
lord

thing

of
my
daughter
sir
a
most
virtuous
princess
and
she
is
fair
too
is
she
not
as

day
in
summer
wondrous
fair
my
daughter
sir
thinks
very
well
of
you
ay
so
well
that
you
must
be
her
master
and
she
will
be
your
scholar
therefore
look
to
it
i
am
unworthy
for
her
schoolmaster
she
thinks
not
so
peruse
this
writing
else
whats
here
a
letter
that
she
loves
the
knight
of
tyre
tis
the
kings
subtilty
to
have
my
life
o
seek
not
to
entrap
me
gracious
lord
a
stranger
and
distressed
gentleman
that
never
aimd
so
high
to
love
your
daughter
but
bent
all
offices
to
honour
her
thou
hast
bewitchd
my
daughter
and
thou
art
a
villain
by
the
gods
i
have
not
never
did
thought
of
mine
levy
offence
nor
never
did
my
actions
yet
commence
a
deed
might
gain
her
love
or
your
displeasure
traitor
thou
liest
traitor
ay
traitor
even
in
his
throat
unless
it
be
the
king
that
calls
me
traitor
i
return
the
lie
now
by
the
gods
i
do
applaud
his
courage
my
actions
are
as
noble
as
my
thoughts
that
never
relishd
of
a
base
descent
i
came
unto
your
court
for
honours
cause
and
not
to
be
a
rebel
to
her
state
and
he
that
otherwise
accounts
of
me
this
sword
shall
prove
hes
honours
enemy
no
here
comes
my
daughter
she
can
witness
it
then
as
you
are
as
virtuous
as
fair
resolve
your
angry
father
if
my
tongue
did
eer
solicit
or
my
hand
subscribe
to
any
syllable
that
made
love
to
you
why
sir
say
if

i
would
it

for
these
poor
men
t
has
been
a
turbulent
and
stormy
night
i
have
been
in
many
but
such
a
night
as
this
till
now
i
neer
endurd
your
master
will
be
dead
ere
you
return
theres
nothing
can
be
ministerd
to
nature
that
can
recover
him
give
this
to
the
pothecary
and
tell
me
how
it
works
good
morrow
sir
good
morrow
to
your
lordship
gentlemen
why
do
you
stir
so
early
sir
our
lodgings
standing
bleak
upon
the
sea
shook
as
the
earth
did
quake
the
very
principals
did
seem
to
rend
and
all
to
topple
pure
surprise
and
fear
made
me
to
quit
the
house
that
is
the
cause
we
trouble
you
so
early
tis
not
our
husbandry
o
you
say
well
but
i
much
marvel
that
your
lordship
having
rich
tire
about
you
should
at
these
early
hours
shake
off
the
golden
slumber
of
repose
tis
most
strange
nature
should
be
so
conversant
with
pain
being
thereto
not
compelld
i
hold
it
ever
virtue
and
cunning
were
endowments
greater
than
nobleness
and
riches
careless
heirs
may
the
two
latter
darken
and
expend
but
immortality
attends
the
former
making
a
man
a
god
tis
known
i
ever
have
studied
physic
through
which
secret
art
by
turning
oer
authorities
i
have
together
with
my
practice
made
familiar
to
me
and
to
my
aid
the
blest
infusions
that
dwell
in
vegetives
in
metals
stones
and
can
speak
of
the
disturbances
that
nature
works
and
of
her
cures
which
doth
give
me
a
more
content
in
course
of
true
delight
than
to
be
thirsty
after
tottering
honour
or
tie
my
treasure
up
in
silken
bags
to
please
the
fool
and
death
your
honour
has
through
ephesus
pourd
forth
your
charity
and
hundreds
call
themselves
your
creatures
who
by
you
have
been
restord
and
not
your
knowledge
your
personal
pain
but
even
your
purse
still
open
hath
built
lord
cerimon
such
strong
renown
as
time
shall
neer
decay
so
lift
there
what
is
that
sir
even
now
did
the
sea
toss
upon
our
shore

chest

of
some
wrack

tis
wondrous
heavy
wrench

a
good
constraint
of
fortune
it
belches
upon
us

so
my
lord
how
close
tis
caulkd
and
bitumed
did
the
sea
cast
it
up
i
never
saw
so
huge
a
billow
sir
as
tossd
it
upon
shore
come
wrench
it
open
soft

smells
most
sweetly
in
my
sense
a
delicate
odour
as
ever
hit
my
nostril
so
up
with
it
o
you
most
potent
gods
whats
here
a
corse
most
strange

on
my
eaning
time
but
whether

welcomd
and
settled
to
his
own
desire
his
woeful
queen
we
leave
at
ephesus
unto
diana
there
a
votaress
now
to
marina
bend
your
mind
whom
our
fastgrowing
scene
must
find
at
tarsus
and
by
cleon
traind
in
music
letters
who
hath
gaind
of
education
all
the
grace
which
makes
her
bath
the
heart
and
places
of
general
wonder
but
alack
that
monster
envy
oft
the
wrack
of
earned
praise
marinas
life
seeks
to
take
off
by
treasons
knife
and
in
this
kind
hath
our
cleon
one
daughter
and
a
wench
full
grown
even
ripe
for
marriagerite
this
maid
hight
philoten
and
it
is
said
for
certain
in
our
story
she
would
ever
with
marina
be
be
t
when
she
weavd
the
sleided
silk
with
fingers
long
small
white
as
milk
or
when
she
would
with
sharp
neeld
wound
the
cambric
which
she
made
more
sound
by
hurting
it
when
to
the
lute
she
sung
and
made
the
nightbird
mute
that
still
records
with
moan
or
when
she
would
with
rich
and
constant
pen
vail
to
her
mistress
dian
still
this
philoten
contends
in
skill
with
absolute
marina
so
with
the
dove
of
paphos
might

this
wind
westerly
that
blows
southwest
when
i
was
born
the
wind
was
north
was
t
so
my
father
as
nurse
said
did
never
fear
but
cried
good
seamen
to
the
sailors
galling
his
kingly
hands
haling
ropes
and
clasping
to
the
mast
endurd
a
sea
that
almost
burst
the
deck
when
was
this
when
i
was
born
never
were
waves
nor
wind
more
violent
and
from
the
laddertackle
washes
off
a
canvasclimber
ha
says
one
wilt
out
and
with
a
dropping
industry
they
skip
from
stem
to
stern
the
boatswain
whistles
and
the
master
calls
and
trebles
their
confusion
come
say
your
prayers
what
mean
you
if
you
require
a
little
space
for
prayer
i
grant
it
pray
but
be
not
tedious
for
the
gods

quick
of
ear
and
i
am
sworn
to
do
my
work
with
haste
why
will
you
kill
me
to
satisfy
my
lady

troth

never
did

living
creature

never
killd
a
mouse
nor
hurt
a
fly
i
trod
upon
a
worm
against
my
will
but
i
wept
for
it
how
have
i
offended
wherein
my
death
might
yield
her
any
profit
or
my
life
imply
her
any
danger
my
commission
is
not
to
reason
of
the
deed
but

me

boult
sir
search
the
market
narrowly
mitylene
is
full
of
gallants
we
lost
too
much
money
this
mart
by
being
too
wenchless
we
were
never
so
much
out
of
creatures
we
have
but
poor
three
and
they
can
do
no
more
than
they
can
do
and
they
with
continual
action
are
even
as
good
as
rotten
therefore
lets
have
fresh
ones
whateer
we
pay
for
them
if
there
be
not
a
conscience
to
be
used
in
every
trade
we
shall
never
prosper
thou
sayst
true
tis
not
the
bringing
up
of
poor
bastards
as
i
think
i
have
brought
up
some
eleven
ay
to
eleven
and
brought
them
down
again
but
shall
i
search
the
market
what
else
man
the
stuff
we
have
a
strong
wind
will
blow
it
to
pieces
they
are
so
pitifully
sodden
thou
sayst
true
theyre
too
unwholesome
o
conscience
the
poor
transylvanian
is
dead
that
lay
with
the
little
baggage
ay
she
quickly
pooped
him
she
made
him
roastmeat
for
worms
but
ill
go
search
the
market
three
or
four
thousand
chequins
were
as
pretty
a
proportion
to
live
quietly
and
so
give
over
why
to
give
over
i
pray
you
is
it
a
shame
to
get
when
we
are
old
o
our
credit
comes
not
in
like
the
commodity
nor
the
commodity
wages
not
with
the
danger
therefore
if
in
our
youths
we
could
pick
up
some
pretty
estate
twere
not
amiss
to
keep
our
door
hatched
besides
the
sore
terms
we
stand
upon
with
the
gods
will
be
strong
with
us
for
giving
over
come
other
sorts
offend
as
well
as
we
as
well
as
we
ay
and
better
too
we
offend
worse

is
our
profession

gain
to
weep
that
you
live
as
ye
do

be
undone
o
dionyza
such
a
piece
of
slaughter
the
sun
and
moon
neer
lookd
upon
i
think
youll
turn
a
child
again
were
i
chief
lord
of
all
this
spacious
world
id
give
it
to
undo
the
deed
o
lady
much
less
in
blood
than
virtue
yet
a
princess
to
equal
any
single
crown
o
the
earth
i
the
justice
of
compare
o
villain
leonine
whom
thou
hast
poisond
too
if
thou
hadst
drunk
to
him
t
had
been
a
kindness
becoming
well
thy
fact
what
canst
thou
say
when
noble
pericles
shall
demand
his
child
that
she
is
dead
nurses
are
not
the
fates
to
foster
it
nor
ever
to
preserve
she
died
at
night
ill
say
so
who
can
cross
it
unless
you
play
the
pious
innocent
and
for
an
honest
attribute
cry
out
she
died
by
foul
play
o
go
to
well
well
of
all
the
faults
beneath
the
heavens
the
gods
do
like
this
worst
be
one
of
those
that
think
the
pretty
wrens
of
tarsus
will
fly
hence
and
open
this
to
pericles
i
do
shame
to
think
of
what
a
noble
strain
you
are
and
of
how
coward
a
spirit
to
such
proceeding
who
ever
but
his
approbation
added
though
not
his
prime
consent
he
did
not
flow
from
honourable
sources
be
it
so
then
yet
none
does
know
but
you
how
she
came
dead
nor
none
can
know
leonine
being
gone
she
did
distain
my
child
and
stood
between
her
and
her
fortunes
none
would
look
on
her
but
cast
their
gazes
on
marinas
face
whilst
ours
was
blurted
at
and
held
a
malkin
not
worth
the
time
of
day
it
piercd
me
thorough
and
though
you
call
my
course
unnatural
you
not
your
child
well
loving
yet
i
find
it
greets
me
as
an
enterprise
of
kindness
performd
to
your
sole
daughter
heavens
forgive
it
and
as
for
pericles
what
should
he
say
we
wept
after
her
hearse
and
even
yet
we
mourn
her
monument
is
almost
finishd
and
her
epitaphs
in
glittering
golden
characters
express
a
general
praise
to
her
and
care
in
us
at
whose
expense
tis
done
thou
art
like
the
harpy
which
to
betray
dost
with
thine
angels
face
seize
with
thine
eagles
talons
you
are
like
one
that
superstitiously
doth
swear
to
the
gods
that
winter
kills
the
flies
but
yet
i
know
youll
do
as
i
advise
thus
time
we
waste
and
longest
leagues
make
short
sail
seas
in
cockles
have
an
wish
but
for
t
making
to
take
your
imagination
from
bourn
to
bourn
region
to
region
by
you
being
pardond
we
commit
no
crime
to
use
one
language
in
each
several
clime
where
our
scenes
seem
to
live
i
do
beseech
you
to
learn
of
me
who
stand
i
the
gaps
to
teach
you
the
stages
of
our
story
pericles
is
now
again
thwarting
the
wayward
seas
attended
on
by
many
a
lord
and
knight
to
see
his
daughter
all
his
lifes
delight
old
helicanus
goes
along
behind
is
left
to
govern
it
you
bear
in
mind
old
escanes
whom
helicanus
late
advancd
in
time
to
great
and
high
estate
wellsailing
ships
and
bounteous
winds
have
brought
this
king
to
tarsus
think
his
pilot
thought
so
with
his
steerage
shall
your
thoughts
grow
on
to
fetch
his
daughter
home
who
first
is
gone
like
motes
and
shadows
see
them
move
awhile
your
ears
unto
your
eyes
ill
reconcile
see
how
belief
may
suffer
by
foul
show
this
borrowd
passion
stands
for
true
old
woe
and
pericles
in
sorrow
all
devourd
with
sighs
shot
through
and
biggest
tears
oershowerd
leaves
tarsus
and
again
embarks
he
swears
never
to
wash
his
face
nor
cut
his
hairs
he
puts
on
sackcloth
and
to
sea
he
bears
a
tempest
which
his
mortal
vessel
tears
and
yet
he
rides
it
out

no
visor
does
become
black
villany
so
well
as
soft
and
tender
flattery
let
pericles
believe
his
daughters
dead
and
bear
his
courses
to
be
ordered
by
lady
fortune
while
our
scene
must
play
his

woe
and
heavy
welladay
in
her
unholy
service
patience

freeze
the

ravished
or
be
rid
of
her
when
she
should
do
for
clients
her
fitment
and
do
me
the
kindness
of
our
profession
she
has
me
her
quirks
her
reasons

knees
that
she
would
make
a
puritan
of
the
devil
if
he
should
cheapen
a
kiss
of
her
faith
i
must
ravish
her
or
shell
disfurnish
us

the
pox
upon
her
greensickness

what
prithee
o
sir

can
be
modest
that
dignifies
the
renown

to
the
stalk
never

i
could
wish
him
to
be
my
master
or
rather
my
mistress
neither

thou
art

they
do
better
thee
in
their
command
thou

a
place
for
which
the

such
as
hath
been
belchd
on
by
infected
lungs
what
would
you
have
me
do
go
to
the
wars
would
you
where
a
man
may
serve
seven
years
for
the
loss
of
a
leg
and
have
not
money
enough
in
the
end
to
buy
him
a
wooden
one
do
any
thing
but
this
thou
doest
empty
old
receptacles
or
common
sewers
of
filth
serve
by
indenture
to
the
common
hangman
any
of
these
ways
are
yet
better
than
this
for
what
thou
professest
a
baboon
could
he
speak
would
own
a
name
too
dear
o
that
the
gods
would
safely
deliver
me
from
this
place
here
heres
gold
for
thee
if
that
thy
master
would
gain
by
me
proclaim
that
i
can
sing
weave
sew
and
dance
with
other
virtues
which
ill
keep
from
boast
and
i
will
undertake
all
these
to
teach
i
doubt
not
but
this
populous
city
will
yield
many
scholars
but
can
you
teach
all
this
you
speak
of
prove
that
i
cannot
take
me
home
again
and
prostitute
me
to
the
basest
groom
that
doth
frequent
your
house
well
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
for
thee
if
i
can
place
thee
i
will
but
amongst
honest
women
faith
my
acquaintance
lies
little
amongst
them
but
since
my
master
and
mistress
have
bought
you
theres
no
going
but
by
their
consent
therefore
i
will
make
them
acquainted
with
your
purpose
and
i
doubt
not
but
i
shall
find
them
tractable
enough
come
ill
do
for
thee
what
i
can
come
your
ways

the
king
a
man
who
for
this
three
months
hath
not
spoken
to
any
one
nor
taken
sustenance
but
to
prorogue
his
grief
upon
what
ground
is
his
distemperature
twould
be
too
tedious
to
repeat
but
the
main
grief
springs
from
the
loss
of
a
beloved
daughter
and
a
wife
may
we
not
see
him
you
may
but
bootless
is
your
sight
he
will
not
speak
to
any
yet
let
me
obtain
my
wish

wager
would
win
some
words
of
him
tis
well
bethought
she
questionless
with
her
sweet
harmony
and
other
chosen
attractions
would
allure
and
make
a
battery
through
his
deafend
ports
which
now
are
midway
stoppd
she
is
all
happy
as
the
fairst
of
all
and
with
her
fellow
maids
is
now
upon
the
leafy
shelter
that
abuts
against
the
islands
side

alls
effectless

nothing
well
omit
that
bears
recoverys
name
but
since
your
kindness
we
have
stretchd
thus
far
let
us
beseech
you
that
for
our
gold
we
may
provision
have
wherein
we
are
not
destitute
for
want
but
weary
for
the
staleness
o
sir
a
courtesy
which
if
we
should
deny
the
most
just
gods
for
every
graff
would
send
a
caterpillar
and
so
afflict
our
province
yet
once
more

entreat
to
know
at
large
the
cause
of
your
kings

a
kingly
patient

thy
prosperous
and
artificial
feat

draw
him
but
to
answer
thee
in
aught
thy
sacred
physic

receive
such
pay
as
thy
desires

endurd
a
grief

equal
yours
if

were
justly
weighd
though
wayward
fortune
did
malign
my
state
my
derivation
was
from
ancestors
who
stood
equivalent
with
mighty
kings
but
time
hath
rooted
out
my
parentage
and
to
the
world
and
awkward
casualties
bound
me
in
servitude
i
will
desist
but
there
is
something

upon
my
cheek
and
whispers
in
mine
ear

my
fortunes

appear
i
am
great
with
woe
and
shall
deliver
weeping
my
dearest
wife

like
this
maid
and
such
a
one
my
daughter
might
have
been
my
queens
square
brows
her
stature
to
an
inch
as
wandlike
straight
as
silvervoicd

jewellike
and
casd
as
richly
in
pace
another
juno
who
starves
the
ears
she
feeds
and
makes
them
hungry
the
more
she
gives
them
speech
where
do
you
live
where
i
am
but
a
stranger
from
the
deck
you
may
discern
the
place
where
were
you
bred
and
how
achievd
you
these
endowments
which
you
make
more
rich
to
owe
should
i
tell
my
history
it
would
seem
like
lies
disdaind
in
the
reporting
prithee
speak
falseness
cannot
come
from
thee
for
thou
lookst
modest
as
justice
and
thou
seemst
a
palace
for
the
crownd
truth
to
dwell
in
i
believe
thee
and
make
my
senses
credit
thy
relation
to
points
that
seem
impossible
for
thou
lookest
like
one
i
lovd
indeed
what
were
thy
friends
didst
thou
not
say
when
i
did
push
thee
back
which
was
when
i
perceivd
thee
that
thou
camst
from
good
descending
so
indeed
i
did
report
thy
parentage
i
think
thou
saidst
thou
hadst
been
tossd
from
wrong
to
injury
and
that
thou
thoughtst
thy
griefs
might
equal
mine
if
both
were
opend
some
such
thing
i
said
and
said
no
more
but
what
my
thoughts
did
warrant
me
was
likely
tell
thy
story
if
thine
considerd
prove
the
thousandth
part
of
my
endurance
thou
art
a
man
and
i
have
sufferd
like
a
girl
yet
thou
dost
look
like
patience
gazing
on
kings
graves
and
smiling
extremity
out
of
act
what
were
thy
friends
how
lost

may
you

descry
a
figure
of
truth
of
faith
of
loyalty
in

appears
the
worth
that

charity
aye
wears
for
wicked
cleon
and
his
wife
when

had
spread
their
cursed
deed
and
honourd

to
rage

by
the
doom
of

end
woes
and
all
merchant
of
syracusa
plead
no
more
i
am
not
partial
to
infringe
our
laws
the
enmity
and
discord
which
of
late
sprung
from
the
rancorous
outrage
of
your
duke
to
merchants
our
welldealing
countrymen
who
wanting
guilders
to
redeem
their
lives
have
seald
his
rigorous
statutes
with
their
bloods
excludes
all
pity
from
our
threatning
looks
for
since
the
mortal
and
intestine
jars
twixt
thy
seditious
countrymen
and
us
it
hath
in
solemn
synods
been
decreed
both
by
the
syracusians
and
ourselves
t
admit
no
traffic
to
our
adverse
towns
nay
more
if
any
born
at
ephesus
be
seen
at
syracusian
marts
and
fairs
again
if
any
syracusian
born
come
to
the
bay
of
ephesus
he
dies
his
goods
confiscate
to

dukes
dispose
unless
a
thousand
marks
be
levied
to
quit
the
penalty
and
to
ransom
him
thy
substance
valud
at
the
highest
rate
cannot
amount
unto
a
hundred

therefore
by
law
thou
art
condemnd
to
die
yet
this
my
comfort
when
your
words
are
done
my
woes
end
likewise
with
the
evening
sun
well
syracusian
say
in
brief
the
cause
why
thou
departedst
from
thy
native
home
and
for
what
cause
thou
camst
to
ephesus
a
heavier
task
could
not
have
been
imposd
than
i
to
speak
my
griefs
unspeakable
yet
that
the
world
may
witness
that
my
end
was
wrought
by
nature
not
by
vile
offence
ill
utter
what
my
sorrow
gives
me
leave
in
syracusa
was
i
born
and
wed
unto
a
woman
happy
but
for
me
and
by
me
too
had
not
our
hap
been
bad
with
her
i
livd
in
joy
our
wealth
increasd
by
prosperous
voyages
i
often
made
to
epidamnum
till
my
factors
death
and
the
great
care
of
goods
at
random
left
drew
me
from
kind
embracements
of
my
spouse
from
whom
my
absence
was
not
six
months
old
before
herself
almost
at
fainting
under
the
pleasing
punishment
that
women
bear
had
made
provision
for
her
following
me
and
soon
and
safe
arrived
where
i
was
there
had
she
not
been
long
but
she
became
a
joyful
mother
of
two
goodly
sons
and
which
was
strange
the
one
so
like
the
other
as
could
not
be
distinguishd
but
by
names
that
very
hour
and
in
the
selfsame
inn
a
meaner
woman
was
delivered
of
such
a
burden
male
twins
both
alike
those
for
their
parents
were
exceeding
poor
i
bought
and
brought
up
to
attend
my
sons
my
wife
not
meanly
proud
of
two
such
boys
made
daily
motions
for
our
home
return
unwilling
i
agreed
alas
too
soon
we
came
aboard
a
league
from
epidamnum
had
we
saild
before
the
alwayswindobeying
deep
gave
any
tragic
instance
of
our
harm
but
longer
did
we
not
retain
much
hope
for
what
obscured
light
the
heavens
did
grant
did
but
convey
unto
our
fearful
minds
a
doubtful
warrant
of
immediate
death
which
though
myself
would
gladly
have
embracd
yet
the
incessant
weepings
of
my
wife
weeping
before
for
what
she
saw
must
come
and
piteous
plainings
of
the
pretty
babes
that
mournd
for
fashion
ignorant
what
to
fear
forcd
me
to
seek
delays
for
them
and
me
and
this
it
was
for
other
means
was
none
the
sailors
sought
for
safety
by
our
boat
and
left
the
ship
then
sinkingripe
to
us
my
wife
more
careful
for
the
latterborn
had
fastend
him
unto
a
small
spare
mast
such
as
seafaring
men
provide
for
storms
to
him
one
of
the
other
twins
was
bound
whilst
i
had
been
like
heedful
of
the
other
the
children
thus
disposd
my
wife
and
i
fixing
our
eyes
on
whom
our
care
was
fixd
fastend
ourselves
at
either
end
the
mast
and
floating
straight
obedient
to
the
stream
were
carried
towards
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
the
sun
gazing
upon
the
earth
dispersd
those
vapours
that
offended
us
and
by
the
benefit
of
his
wished
light
the
seas
waxd
calm
and
we
discovered
two
ships
from
far
making
amain
to
us
of
corinth
that
of
epidaurus
this
but
ere
they
came
o
let
me
say
no
more
gather
the
sequel
by
that
went
before
nay
forward
old
man
do
not
break
off
so
for
we
may
pity
though
not
pardon
thee
o
had
the
gods
done
so
i
had
not
now
worthily
termd
them
merciless
to
us
for
ere
the
ships
could
meet
by
twice
five
leagues
we
were
encounterd
by
a
mighty
rock
which
being
violently
borne
upon
our
helpful
ship
was
splitted
in
the
midst
so
that
in
this
unjust
divorce
of
us
fortune
had
left
to
both
of
us
alike
what
to
delight
in
what
to
sorrow
for
her
part
poor
soul
seeming
as
burdened
with
lesser
weight
but
not
with
lesser
woe
was
carried
with
more
speed
before
the
wind
and
in
our
sight
they
three
were
taken
up
by
fishermen
of
corinth
as
we
thought
at
length
another
ship
had
seizd
on
us
and
knowing
whom
it
was
their
hap
to
save
gave
healthful
welcome
to
their
shipwrackd
guests
and
would
have
reft
the
fishers
of
their
prey
had
not
their
bark
been
very
slow
of
sail
and
therefore
homeward
did
they
bend
their
course
thus
have
you
heard
me
severd
from
my
bliss
that
by
misfortune
was
my
life
prolongd
to
tell
sad
stories
of
my
own
mishaps
and
for
the
sake
of
them
thou
sorrowest
for
do
me
the
favour
to
dilate
at
full
what
hath
befalln
of
them
and
thee
till
now
my
youngest
boy
and
yet
my
eldest
care
at
eighteen
years
became
inquisitive
after
his
brother
and
importund
me
that
his
attendant
for
his
case
was
like
reft
of
his
brother
but
retaind
his
name
might
bear
him
company
in
the
quest
of
him
whom
whilst
i
labourd
of
a
love
to
see
i
hazarded
the
loss
of
whom
i
lovd
five
summers
have
i
spent
in
furthest
greece
roaming
clean
through
the
bounds
of
asia
and
coasting
homeward
came
to
ephesus
hopeless
to
find
yet
loath
to
leave
unsought
or
that
or
any
place
that
harbours
men
but
here
must
end
the
story
of
my
life
and
happy
were
i
in
my
timely
death
could
all
my
travels
warrant
me
they
live
hapless
geon
whom
the
fates
have
markd
to
bear
the
extremity
of
dire
mishap
now
trust
me
were
it
not
against
our
laws
against
my
crown
my
oath
my
dignity
which
princes
would

not
disannul

upon
my
life
by
some
device
or
other
the
villain
is
oerraught
of
all
my
money
they
say
this
town
is
full
of
cozenage
as
nimble
jugglers
that
deceive
the
eye
darkworking
sorcerers
that
change
the
mind
soulkilling
witches
that
deform
the
body
disguised
cheaters
prating
mountebanks
and
many
suchlike
liberties
of
sin
if
it
prove
so
i
will
be
gone
the
sooner
ill
to
the
centaur
to
go
seek
this
slave
i
greatly
fear
my
money
is
not
safe
neither
my
husband
nor
the
slave
returnd
that
in
such
haste
i
sent
to
seek
his
master
sure
luciana
it
is
two
oclock
perhaps
some
merchant
hath
invited
him
and
from
the
mart
hes
somewhere
gone
to
dinner
good
sister
let
us
dine
and
never
fret
a
man
is
master
of
his
liberty
time
is
their
master
and
when
they
see
time
theyll
go
or
come
if
so
be
patient
sister
why
should
their
liberty
than
ours
be
more
because
their
business
still
lies
out
o
door
look
when
i
serve
him
so
he
takes
it
ill
o
know
he
is
the
bridle
of
your
will
theres
none
but
asses
will
be
bridled
so
why
headstrong
liberty
is
lashd
with
woe
theres
nothing
situate
under
heavens
eye
but
hath
his
bound
in
earth
in
sea
in
sky
the
beasts
the
fishes
and
the
winged
fowls
are
their
males
subjects
and
at
their
controls
men
more
divine
the
masters
of
all
these
lords
of
the
wide
world
and
wild
watry
seas
indud
with
intellectual
sense
and
souls
of
more
preeminence
than
fish
and
fowls
are
masters
to
their
females
and
their
lords
then
let
your
will
attend
on
their
accords
this
servitude
makes
you
to
keep
unwed
not
this
but
troubles
of
the
marriagebed
but
were
you
wedded
you
would
bear
some
sway
ere
i
learn
love
ill
practise
to
obey
how
if
your
husband
start
some
other
where
till
he
come
home
again
i
would
forbear
patience
unmovd
no
marvel
though
she
pause
they
can
be
meek
that
have
no
other
cause
a
wretched
soul
bruisd
with
adversity
we
bid
be
quiet
when
we
hear
it
cry
but
were
we
burdend
with
like
weight
of
pain
as
much
or
more
we
should
ourselves
complain
so
thou
that
hast
no
unkind
mate
to
grieve
thee
with
urging
helpless
patience
wouldst
relieve
me
but
if
thou
live
to
see
like
right
bereft
this
foolbeggd
patience
in
thee
will
be
left
well
i
will
marry
one
day
but
to
try
here
comes
your
man
now
is
your
husband
nigh
say

your
tardy
master
now
at
hand

at
two
hands
with
me
and

two
ears
can
witness
say
didst
thou
speak
with
him
knowst
thou
his
mind
ay
ay
he
told
his
mind
upon
mine
ear
beshrew
his
hand
i
scarce
could
understand
it
spake
he
so
doubtfully
thou
couldst
not
feel
his
meaning
nay
he
struck
so
plainly
i
could
too
well
feel
his
blows
and
withal
so
doubtfully
that
i
could
scarce
understand
them
but
say
i
prithee
is
he
coming
home
it
seems
he
hath
great
care
to
please
his
wife

so
that
my
errand

unto
my
tongue

a
football
you
do
spurn
me
thus
you
spurn
me
hence
and
he
will
spurn
me
hither
if
i
last
in
this
service
you
must
case
me
in
leather
fie
how
impatience
loureth
in
your
face
his
company
must
do
his
minions
grace
whilst
i
at
home
starve
for
a
merry
look
hath
homely
age
the
alluring
beauty
took
from
my
poor
cheek
then
he
hath
wasted
it
are
my
discourses
dull
barren
my
wit
if
voluble
and
sharp
discourse
be
marrd
unkindness
blunts
it
more
than
marble
hard
do
their
gay
vestments
his
affections
bait
thats
not
my
fault
hes
master
of
my
state
what
ruins
are
in
me
that
can
be
found
by
him
not
ruind
then
is
he
the
ground
of
my
defeatures
my
decayed
fair
a
sunny
look
of
his
would
soon
repair
but
too
unruly
deer
he
breaks
the
pale
and
feeds
from
home
poor
i
am
but
his
stale
selfharming
jealousy
fie
beat
it
hence
unfeeling
fools
can
with
such
wrengs
dispense
i
know
his
eye
doth
homage
otherwhere
or
else
what
lets
it
but
he
would
be
here
sister
you
know
he
promisd
me
a
chain
would
that
alone
alone
he
would
detain
so
he
would
keep
fair
quarter
with
his
bed
i
see
the
jewel
best
enamelled
will
lose
his
beauty
and
though
gold
bides
still
that
others
touch
yet
often
touching
will
wear
gold
and
no
man
that
hath
a
name
by
falsehood
and
corruption
doth
it
shame
since
that
my
beauty
cannot
please
his
eye
ill
weep
whats
left
away
and
weeping
die
how
many
fond
fools
serve
mad
jealousy
the
gold
i
gave
to
dromio
is
laid
up
safe
at
the
centaur
and
the
heedful
slave
is
wanderd
forth
in
care
to
seek
me
out
by
computation
and
mine
hosts
report
i
could
not
speak
with
dromio
since
at
first
i
sent
him
from
the
mart
see
here
he
comes
how
now
sir
is
your
merry
humour
alterd
as
you
love
strokes
so
jest
with
me
again
you
know
no
centaur
you
receivd
no
gold
your
mistress
sent
to
have
me
home
to
dinner
my
house
was
at
the
ph
nix
wast
thou
mad
that
thus
so
madly
thou
didst
answer
me
what
answer
sir
when
spake
i
such
a
word
even
now
even
here
not
halfanhour
since
i
did
not
see
you
since
you
sent
me
hence
home
to
the
centaur
with
the
gold
you
gave
me
villain
thou
didst
deny
the
golds
receipt
and
toldst
me
of
a
mistress
and
a
dinner
for
which
i
hope
thou
feltst
i
was
displeasd
i
am
glad
to
see
you
in
this
merry
vein
what
means
this
jest
i
pray
you
master
tell
me
yea
dost
thou
jeer
and
flout
me
in
the
teeth
thinkst
thou
i
jest
hold
take
thou
that
and
that
hold
sir
for
gods
sake
now
your
jest
is
earnest
upon
what
bargain
do
you
give
it
me
because
that
i
familiarly
sometimes
do
use
you
for
my
fool
and
chat
with
you
your
sauciness
will
jest
upon
my
love
and
make
a
common
of
my
serious
hours
when

sconce
for
my
head
and
insconce
it
too
or

shall
seek
my
wit
in
my
shoulders
but
i
pray
sir
why

i
beaten
dost
thou
not
know
nothing
sir
but
that
i
am
beaten
shall
i
tell
you
why
ay
sir
and
wherefore
for
they
say
every
why
hath
a
wherefore
why
first
for
flouting
me
and
then
wherefore
for
urging
it
the
second
time
to
me
was
there
ever
any
man
thus
beaten
out
of
season
when
in
the
why
and
the
wherefore
is
neither
rime
nor
reason
well
sir
i
thank
you
thank
me
sir
for
what
marry
sir
for
this
something
that
you
gave
me
for
nothing
ill
make
you
amends
next
to
give
you
nothing
for
something
but
say
sir
is

think

that
i
have
in

time
sir

that
basting
well
sir
then
twill
be
dry
if
it
be
sir
i
pray
you
eat
none
of
it
your
reason
lest
it
make
you
choleric
and
purchase
me
another
dry
basting
well
sir
learn
to
jest
in
good
time
theres
a
time
for
all
things
i
durst
have
denied
that
before
you
were
so
choleric
by
what
rule
sir
marry
sir
by
a
rule
as
plain
as
the
plain
bald
pate
of
father
time
himself
lets
hear
it
theres
no
time
for
a
man
to
recover
his
hair
that
grows
bald
by
nature
may
he
not
do
it
by
fine
and
recovery
yes
to
pay
a
fine
for
a
periwig
and
recover
the
lost
hair
of
another
man
why
is
time
such
a
niggard
of
hair
being
as
it
is
so
plentiful
an
excrement
because
it
is
a
blessing
that
he
bestows
on
beasts
and
what
he
hath
scanted
men
in
hair
he
hath
given
them
in
wit
why
but
theres
many
a
man
hath
more
hair
than
wit
not
a
man
of
those
but
he
hath
the
wit
to
lose
his
hair
why
thou
didst
conclude
hairy
men
plain
dealers
without
wit
the
plainer
dealer
the
sooner
lost
yet
be
loseth
it
in
a
kind
of
jollity
for
what
reason
for
two
and
sound
ones
too
nay
not
sound
i
pray
you
sure
ones
then
nay
not
sure
in
a
thing
falsing
certain
ones
then
name
them
the
one
to
save
the
money
that
he
spends
in
tiring
the
other
that
at
dinner
they
should
not
drop
in
his
porridge
you
would
all
this
time
have
proved
there
is
no
time
for
all
things
marry
and
did
sir
namely
no
time
to
recover
hair
lost
by
nature
but
your
reason
was
not
substantial
why
there
is
not
time
to
recover
thus
i
mend
it
time
himself
is
bald
and
therefore
to
the
worlds
end
will
have
bald
followers
i
knew
twould
be
a
bald
conclusion
but
soft
who
wafts
us
yonder
ay
ay
antipholus
look
strange
and
frown
some
other
mistress
hath
thy
sweet
aspects

from

drop
of
water
in

breaking
gulf
and
take
unmingled
thence

spit
at

and
tear
the
staind
skin

therefore
see
thou
do
it
i
am
possessd
with
an
adulterate
blot

mingled
with
the
crime
of
lust
for
if
we
two
be
one
and
thou
play
false
i
do
digest
the
poison
of
thy
flesh
being
strumpeted
by
thy
contagion

by
dromio
by
me
by
thee
and
this
thou
didst
return
from
him
that
he
did
buffet
thee
and
in
his
blows
denied
my
house
for
his
me
for
his
wife
did
you
converse
sir
with
this
gentlewoman
what
is
the
course
and
drift
of
your
compact
i
sir
i
never
saw
her
till
this
time
villain
thou
liest
for
even
her
very
words
didst
thou
deliver
to
me
on
the
mart
i
never
spake
with
her
in
all
my
life
how
can
she
thus
then
call
us
by
our
names
unless
it
be
by
inspiration
how
ill
agrees
it
with
your
gravity
to
counterfeit
thus
grossly
with
your
slave
a
betting
him
to
thwart
me
in
my
mood
be
it
my
wrong

sleeve
of
thine
thou
art
an
elm
my
husband
i

whose
weakness

thy
stronger
state
makes
me
with
thy
strength
to
communicate

thee
from
me
it
is
dross
usurping
ivy
brier
or
idle
moss
who
all
for
want
of
pruning
with
intrusion
infect
thy
sap
and
live
on
thy
confusion

me
she
speaks

moves
me
for
her
theme
what

i
married
to
her
in
my
dream

besides

i
am
due
to
a
woman
one
that
claims

one
that
haunts
me
one
that
will
have
me
what
claim

to
thee

such
claim
as
you
would
lay
to
your
horse
and
she
would
have
me
as
a
beast
not
that
i
being
a
beast
she
would
have
me
but
that
she
being
a
very
beastly
creature
lays
claim
to
me
what
is
she
a
very
reverent
body
aye
such
a
one
as
a
man
may
not
speak
of
without
he
say
sirreverence
i
have
but
lean
luck
in
the
match
and
yet
is
she
a
wondrous
fat
marriage
how
dost
thou
mean
a
fat
marriage
marry
sir
shes
the
kitchenwench
and
all
grease
and
i
know
not
what
use
to
put
her
to
but
to
make
a
lamp
of
her
and
run
from
her
by
her
own
light
i
warrant
her
rags
and
the
tallow
in
them
will
burn
a
poland
winter
if
she
lives
till
doomsday
shell
burn
a
week
longer
than
the
whole
world
what
complexion
is
she
of
swart
like
my
shoe
but
her
face
nothing
like
so
clean
kept
for
why
she
sweats
a
man
may
go
over
shoes
in
the
grime
of
it
thats
a
fault
that
water
will
mend
no
sir
tis
in
grain
noahs
flood
could
not
do
it
whats
her
name
nell
sir
but
her
name
and
three
quarters
that
is
an
ell
and
three
quarters
will
not
measure
her
from
hip
to
hip
then
she
bears
some
breadth
no
longer
from
head
to
foot
than
from
hip
to
hip
she
is
spherical
like
a
globe
i
could
find
out
countries
in
her
in
what
part
of
her
body
stands
ireland
marry
sir
in
her
buttocks
i
found
it
out
by
the
bogs
where
scotland
i
found
it
by
the
barrenness
hard
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
where
france
in
her
forehead
armed
and
reverted
making
war
against
her
heir
where
england
i
looked
for
the
chalky
cliffs
but
i
could
find
no
whiteness
in
them
but
i
guess
it
stood
in
her
chin
by
the
salt
rheum
that
ran
between
france
and
it
where
spain
faith
i
saw
not
but
i
felt
it
hot
in
her
breath
where
america
the
indies
o
sir
upon
her
nose
all
oer
embellished
with
rubies
carbuncles
sapphires
declining
their
rich
aspect
to
the
hot
breath
of
spain
who
sent
whole
armadoes
of
caracks
to
be
ballast
at
her
nose
where
stood
belgia
the
netherlands
o
sir
i
did
not
look
so
low
to
conclude
this
drudge
or
diviner
laid
claim
to
me
calld
me
dromio
swore
i
was
assured
to
her
told
me
what
privy
marks
i
had
about
me
as
the
mark
of
my
shoulder
the
mole
in
my
neck
the
great
wart
on
my
left
arm
that
i
amazed
ran
from
her
as
a
witch
and
i
think
if
my
breast
had
not
been
made
of
faith
and
my
heart
of
steel
she
had
transformd
me
to
a
curtal
dog
and
made
me
turn
i
the
wheel
go
hie
thee
presently
post
to
the
road
an
if
the
wind
blow
any
way
from
shore
i
will
not
harbour
in
this
town
tonight
if
any
bark
put
forth
come
to
the
mart
where
i
will
walk
till
thou
return
to
me
if
every
one
knows
us
and
we
know
none
tis
time
i
think
to
trudge
pack
and
be
gone
as
from
a
bear
a
man
would
run
for
life
so
fly
i
from
her
that
would
be
my
wife
theres
none
but
witches
do
inhabit
here
and
therefore
tis
high
time
that
i
were
hence
she
that
doth
call
me
husband
even
my
soul
doth
for
a
wife
abhor
but
her
fair
sister
possessd
with
such
a
gentle
sovereign
grace
of
such
enchanting
presence
and
discourse
hath
almost
made
me
traitor
to
myself
but
lest
myself
be
guilty
to
selfwrong
ill
stop
mine
ears
against
the
mermaids
song

stay
if
any
ship

the

to

and
for
the
same
he
promisd
me
a

he
denies

now
the
reason
that
i
gather

a
mad

my

tell
his

that
being
lunatic
he
rushd
into
my
house
and
took
perforce
my

they
speak

such
a
gentle
nation
that
but
for
the
mountain
of
mad
flesh
that

i
could
find
in
my
heart
to

town
therefore

sorry

that
i
have
hinderd
you
but
i
protest
he
had
the
chain
of
me
though
most
dishonestly
he
doth
deny
it
how
is
the
man
esteemd
here
in
the
city
of
very
reverend
reputation
sir
of
credit
infinite
highly
belovd
second
to
none
that
lives
here
in
the
city
his
word
might
bear
my
wealth
at
any
time
speak
softly
yonder
as
i
think
he
walks
tis
so
and
that
self
chain
about
his
neck
which
he
forswore
most
monstrously
to
have
good
sir
draw
near
to
me
ill
speak
to
him
signior
antipholus
i
wonder
much
that
you
would
put
me
to
this
shame
and
trouble
and
not
without
some
scandal
to
yourself
with
circumstance
and
oaths
so
to
deny
this
chain
which
now
you
wear
so
openly
beside
the
charge
the
shame
imprisonment
you
have
done
wrong
to
this
my
honest
friend
who
but
for
staying
on
our
controversy
had
hoisted
sail
and
put
to
sea
today
this
chain
you
had
of
me
can
you
deny
it
i
think
i
had
i
never
did
deny
it
yes
that
you
did
sir
and
forswore
it
too
who
heard
me
to
deny
it
or
forswear
it
these
ears
of
mine
thou
knowst
did
hear
thee
fie
on
thee
wretch
tis
pity
that
thou
livst
to
walk
where
any
honest
men
resort
thou
art
a
villain
to
impeach
me
thus
ill
prove
mine
honour
and
mine
honesty
against
thee
presently
if
thou
darst
stand
i
dare
and
do
defy
thee
for
a
villain
hold
hurt
him
not
for
gods
sake
he
is
mad
some
get
within
him
take
his
sword
away
bind
dromio
too
and
bear
them
to
my
house
run
master
run
for
gods
sake
take
a
house
this
is
some
priory
in
or
we
are
spoild
be
quiet
people
wherefore
throng
you
hither
to
fetch
my
poor
distracted
husband
hence
let
us
come
in
that
we
may
bind
him
fast
and
bear
him
home
for
his
recovery
i
knew
he
was
not
in
his
perfect
wits
i
am
sorry
now
that
i
did
draw
on
him
how
long
hath
this
possession
held
the
man
this
week
he
hath
been
heavy
sour
sad
and
much
different
from
the
man
he
was
but
till
this
afternoon
his
passion
neer
brake
into
extremity
of
rage
hath
he
not
lost
much
wealth
by
wrack
of
sea
buried
some
dear
friend
hath
not
else
his
eye
strayd
his
affection
in
unlawful
love
a
sin
prevailing
much
in
youthful
men
who
give
their
eyes
the
liberty
of
gazing
which
of
these
sorrows
is
he
subject
to
to
none
of
these
except
it
be
the
last
namely
some
love
that
drew
him
oft
from
home
you
should
for
that
have
reprehended
him
why
so
i
did
ay
but
not
rough
enough
as
roughly
as
my
modesty
would
let
me
haply
in
private
and
in
assemblies
too
ay
but
not
enough
it
was
the
copy
of
our
conference
in
bed
he
slept
not
for
my
urging
it
at
board
he
fed
not
for
my
urging
it
alone
it
was
the
subject
of
my
theme
in
company
i
often
glanced
it
still
did
i
tell
him
it
was
vile
and
bad
and
thereof
came
it
that
the
man
was
mad
the
venom
clamours
of
a
jealous
woman
poison
more
deadly
than
a
mad
dogs
tooth
it
seems
his
sleeps
were
hinderd
by
thy
railing
and
thereof
comes
it
that
his
head
is
light
thou
sayst
his
meat
was
saucd
with
thy
upbraidings
unquiet
meals
make
ill
digestions
thereof
the
raging
fire
of
fever
bred
and
whats
a
fever
but
a
fit
of
madness
thou
sayst
his
sports
were
hinderd
by
thy
brawls
sweet
recreation
barrd
what
doth
ensue
but
moody
moping
and
dull
melancholy
kinsman
to
grim
and
comfortless
despair
and
at
her
heels
a
huge
infectious
troop
of
pale
distemperatures
and
foes
to
life
in
food
in
sport
and
lifepreserving
rest
to
be
disturbd
would
mad
or
man
or
beast
the
consequence
is
then
thy
jealous
fits
have
scard
thy
husband
from
the
use
of
wits
she
never
reprehended
him
but
mildly
when
he
demeand
himself
rough
rude
and
wildly
why
bear
you
these
rebukes
and
answer
not
she
did
betray
me
to
my
own
reproof
good
people
enter
and
lay
hold
on
him
no
not
a
creature
enters
in
my
house
then
let
your
servants
bring
my
husband
forth
neither
he
took
this
place
for
sanctuary
and
it
shall
privilege
him
from
your
hands
till
i
have
brought
him
to
his
wits
again
or
lose
my
labour
in
assaying
it
i
will
attend
my
husband
be
his
nurse
diet
his
sickness
for
it
is
my
office
and
will
have
no
attorney
but
myself
and
therefore
let
me
have
him
home
with
me
be
patient
for
i
will
not
let
him
stir
till
i
have
usd
the
approved
means
i
have
with
wholesome
syrups
drugs
and
holy
prayers
to
make
of
him
a
formal
man
again
it
is
a
branch
and
parcel
of
mine
oath
a
charitable
duty
of
my
order
therefore
depart
and
leave
him
here
with
me
i
will
not
hence
and
leave
my
husband
here
and
ill
it
doth
beseem
your
holiness
to
separate
the
husband
and
the
wife
be
quiet
and
depart
thou
shalt
not
have
him
complain
unto
the
duke
of
this
indignity
come
go
i
will
fall
prostrate
at
his
feet
and
never
rise
until
my
tears
and
prayers
have
won
his
grace
to
come
in
person
hither
and
take
perforce
my
husband
from
the
abbess
by
this
i
think
the
dial
points
at
five
anon
im
sure
the
duke
himself
in
person
comes
this
way
to
the
melancholy
vale
the
place
of
death
and
sorry
execution
behind
the
ditches
of
the
abbey
here
upon
what
cause
to
see
a
reverend
syracusian
merchant
who
put
unluckily
into
this
bay
against
the
laws
and
statutes
of
this
town
beheaded
publicly
for
his
offence
see
where
they
come
we
will
behold
his
death
kneel
to
the
duke
before
he
pass
the
abbey
yet
once
again
proclaim
it
publicly
if
any
friend
will
pay
the
sum
for
him
he
shall
not
die
so
much
we
tender
him
justice
most
sacred
duke
against
the
abbess
she
is
a
virtuous
and
a
reverend
lady
it
cannot
be
that
she
hath
done
thee
wrong
may
it
please
your
grace
antipholus
my
husband
whom
i
made
lord
of
me
and
all
i
had
at
your
important
letters
this
ill
day
a
most
outrageous
fit
of
madness
took
him
that
desperately
he
hurried
through
the
street
with
him
his
bondman
all
as
mad
as
he
doing
displeasure
to
the
citizens
by
rushing
in
their
houses
bearing
thence
rings
jewels
anything
his
rage
did
like
once
did
i
get
him
bound
and
sent
him
home
whilst
to
take
order
for
the
wrongs
i
went
that
here
and
there
his
fury
had
committed
anon
i
wot
not
by
what
strong
escape
he
broke
from
those
that
had
the
guard
of
him
and
with
his
mad
attendant
and
himself
each
one
with
ireful
passion
with
drawn
swords
met
us
again
and
madly
bent
on
us
chasd
us
away
till
raising
of
more
aid
we
came
again
to
bind
them
then
they
fled
into
this
abbey
whither
we
pursud
them
and
here
the
abbess
shuts
the
gates
on
us
and
will
not
suffer
us
to
fetch
him
out
nor
send
him
forth
that
we
may
bear
him
hence
therefore
most
gracious
duke
with
thy
command
let
him
be
brought
forth
and
borne
hence
for
help
long
since
thy
husband
servd
me
in
my
wars
and
i
to
thee
engagd
a
princes
word
when
thou
didst
make
him
master
of
thy
bed
to
do
him
all
the
grace
and
good
i
could
go
some
of
you
knock
at
the
abbey
gate
and
bid
the
lady
abbess
come
to
me

will
determine
this

while

but
she
tells
to
your
highness
simple
truth
o
perjurd
woman
they
are
both
forsworn
in
this
the
madman
justly
chargeth
them
my
liege
i
am
advised
what
i
say
neither
disturbd
with
the
effect
of
wine
nor
headyrash
provokd
with
raging
ire
albeit
my
wrongs
might
make
one
wiser
mad
this
woman
lockd
me
out
this
day
from
dinner
that
goldsmith
there
were
he
not
packd
with
her
could
witness
it
for
he
was
with
me
then
who
parted
with
me
to
go
fetch
a
chain
promising
to
bring
it
to
the
porpentine
where
balthazar
and
i
did
dine
together
our
dinner
done
and
he
not
coming
thither
i
went
to
seek
him
in
the
street
i
met
him
and
in
his
company
that
gentleman
there
did
this
perjurd
goldsmith
swear
me
down
that
i
this
day
of
him
receivd
the
chain
which
god
he
knows
i
saw
not
for
the
which
he
did
arrest
me
with
an
officer
i
did
obey
and
sent
my
peasant
home
for
certain
ducats
he
with
none
returnd
then
fairly
i
bespoke
the
officer
to
go
in
person
with
me
to
my
house
by
the
way
we
met
my
wife
her
sister
and
a
rabble
more
of
vile
confederates
along
with
them
they
brought
one
pinch
a
hungry
leanfacd
villain
a
mere
anatomy
a
mountebank
a
threadbare
juggler
and
a
fortuneteller
a
needy
holloweyd
sharplooking
wretch
a
livingdead
man
this
pernicious
slave
forsooth
took
on
him
as
a
conjurer
and
gazing
in
mine
eyes
feeling
my
pulse
and
with
no
face
as
twere
outfacing
me
cries
out
i
was
possessd
then
altogether
they
fell
upon
me
bound
me
bore
me
thence
and
in
a
dark
and
dankish
vault
at
home
there
left
me
and
my
man
both
bound
together
till
gnawing
with
my
teeth
my
bonds
in
sunder
i
gaind
my
freedom
and
immediately
ran
hither
to
your
grace
whom
i
beseech
to
give
me
ample
satisfaction
for
these
deep
shames
and
great
indignities
my
lord
in
truth
thus
far
i
witness
with
him
that
he
dind
not
at
home
but
was
lockd
out
but
had
he
such
a
chain
of
thee
or
no
he
had
my
lord
and
when
he
ran
in
here
these
people
saw
the
chain
about
his
neck
besides
i
will
be
sworn
these
ears
of
mine
heard
you
confess
you
had
the
chain
of
him
after
you
first
forswore
it
on
the
mart
and
thereupon
i
drew
my
sword
on
you
and
then
you
fled
into
this
abbey
here
from
whence
i
think
you
are
come
by
miracle
i
never
came
within
these
abbey
walls
nor
ever
didst
thou
draw
thy
sword
on
me
i
never
saw
the
chain
so
help
me
heaven
and
this
is
false
you
burden
me
withal
why
what
an
intricate
impeach
is
this
i
think
you
all
have
drunk
of
circes
cup
if
here
you
housd
him
here
he
would
have
been
if
he
were
mad
he
would
not
plead
so
coldly
you
say
he
dind
at
home
the
goldsmith
here
denies
that
saying
sirrah
what
say
you
sir
he
dind
with
her
there
at
the
porpentine
he
did
and
from
my
finger
snatchd
that
ring
tis
true
my
liege
this
ring
i
had
of
her
sawst
thou
him
enter
at
the
abbey
here
as
sure
my
liege
as
i
do
see
your
grace
why
this
is
strange
go
call
the
abbess
hither
i
think
you
are
all
mated
or
stark
mad
most
mighty
duke
vouchsafe
me
speak
a
word
haply
i
see
a
friend
will
save
my
life
and
pay
the
sum
that
may
deliver
me
speak
freely
syracusian
what
thou
wilt

this
hour

in
my
life

now
o
grief
hath
changd
me
since
you
saw
me
last
and
careful
hours
with
times
deformed
hand

written
strange
defeatures
in
my
face
but

dost
thou
not
know
my
voice
neither
dromio
nor
thou
no
trust

i
i
am
sure
thou
dost
ay

whatsoever
a
man
denies

my
voice
o
times
extremity

thou
so
crackd
and
splitted
my
poor
tongue
in
seven
short
years

my
only
son

feeble
key
of
untund
cares

grained
face
of
mine

hid
in
sapconsuming
winters
drizzled
snow
and
all
the
conduits
of
my
blood
froze
up
yet
hath
my
night
of
life
some
memory

elder
thats
a
question
how
shall
we
try
it
well
draw
cuts
for
the
senior
till
then
lead
thou
first
nay
then
thus
we
came
into
the
world
like
brother
and
brother
and
now
lets
go
hand
in
hand
not
one
before
another
the
merchant
of
venice
in
sooth
i
know
not
why
i
am
so
sad
it
wearies
me
you
say
it
wearies
you
but
how
i
caught
it
found
it
or
came
by
it
what
stuff
tis
made
of
whereof
it
is
born
i
am
to
learn
and
such
a
wantwit
sadness
makes
of
me
that
i
have
much
ado
to
know
myself
your
mind
is
tossing
on
the
ocean
there
where
your
argosies
with
portly
sail
like
signiors
and
rich
burghers
on
the
flood
or
as
it
were
the
pageants
of
the
sea
do
overpeer
the
petty
traffickers
that
curtsy
to
them
do
them
reverence
as
they
fly
by
them
with
their
woven
wings
believe
me
sir
had
i
such
venture
forth
the
better
part
of
my
affections
would
be
with
my
hopes
abroad
i
should
be
still
plucking
the
grass
to
know
where
sits
the
wind
peering
in
maps
for
ports
and
piers
and
roads
and
every
object
that
might
make
me
fear
misfortune
to
my
ventures
out
of
doubt
would
make
me
sad
my
wind
cooling
my
broth
would
blow
me
to
an
ague
when
i
thought
what
harm
a
wind
too
great
might
do
at
sea
i
should
not
see
the
sandy
hourglass
run
but
i
should
think
of
shallows
and
of
flats
and
see
my
wealthy
andrew
dockd
in
sand
vailing
her
hightop
lower
than
her
ribs
to
kiss
her
burial
should
i
go
to
church
and
see
the
holy
edifice
of
stone
and
not
bethink
me
straight
of
dangerous
rocks
which
touching
but
my
gentle
vessels
side
would
scatter
all
her
spices
on
the
stream
enrobe
the
roaring
waters
with
my
silks
and
in
a
word
but
even
now
worth
this
and
now
worth
nothing
shall
i
have
the
thought
to
think
on
this
and
shall
i
lack
the
thought
that
such
a
thing
bechancd
would
make
me
sad
but
tell
not
me
i
know
antonio
is
sad
to
think
upon
his
merchandise
believe
me
no
i
thank
my
fortune
for
it
my
ventures
are
not
in
one
bottom
trusted
nor
to
one
place
nor
is
my
whole
estate
upon
the
fortune
of
this
present
year
therefore
my
merchandise
makes
me
not
sad
why
then
you
are
in
love
fie
fie
not
in
love
neither
then
lets
say
you
are
sad
because
you
are
not
merry
and
twere
as
easy
for
you
to
laugh
and
leap
and
say
you
are
merry
because
you
are
not
sad
now
by
twoheaded
janus
nature
hath
framd
strange
fellows
in
her
time
some
that
will
evermore
peep
through
their
eyes
and
laugh
like
parrots
at
a
bagpiper
and
other
of
such
vinegar
aspect
that
theyll
not
show
their
teeth
in
way
of
smile
though
nestor
swear
the
jest
be
laughable
here
comes
bassanio
your
most
noble
kinsman
gratiano
and
lorenzo
fare
ye
well
we
leave
you
now
with
better
company
i
would
have
stayd
till
i
had
made
you
merry
if
worthier
friends
had
not
prevented
me
your
worth
is
very
dear
in
my
regard
i
take
it
your
own
business
calls
on
you
and
you
embrace
the
occasion
to
depart
good
morrow
my
good
lords
good
signiors
both
when
shall
we
laugh
say
when
you
grow
exceeding
strange
must
it
be
so
well
make
our
leisures
to
attend
on
yours
my
lord
bassanio
since
you
have
found
antonio
we
too
will
leave
you
but
at
dinnertime
i
pray
you
have
in
mind
where
we
must
meet
i
will
not
fail
you
you
look
not
well
signior
antonio
you
have
too
much
respect
upon
the
world
they
lose
it
that
do
buy
it
with
much
care
believe
me
you
are
marvellously
changd
i
hold
the
world
but
as
the
world
gratiano
a
stage
where
every
man
must
play
a
part
and
mine
a
sad
one
let
me
play
the
fool
with
mirth
and
laughter
let
old
wrinkles
come
and
let
my
liver
rather
heat
with
wine
than
my
heart
cool
with
mortifying
groans
why
should
a
man
whose
blood
is
warm
within
sit
like
his
grandsire
cut
in
alabaster
sleep
when
he
wakes
and
creep
into
the
jaundice
by
being
peevish
i
tell
thee
what
antonio
i
love
thee
and
it
is
my
love
that
speaks
there
are
a
sort
of
men
whose
visages
do
cream
and
mantle
like
a
standing
pond
and
do
a
wilful
stillness
entertain
with
purpose
to
be
dressd
in
an
opinion
of
wisdom
gravity
profound
conceit
as
who
should
say
i
am
sir
oracle
and
when
i
ope
my
lips
let
no
dog
bark
o
my
antonio
i
do
know
of
these
that
therefore
only
are
reputed
wise
for
saying
nothing
when
i
am
very
sure
if
they
should
speak
would
almost
damn
those
ears
which
hearing
them
would
call
their
brothers
fools
ill
tell
thee
more
of
this
another
time
but
fish
not
with
this
melancholy
bait
for
this
foolgudgeon
this
opinion
come
good
lorenzo
fare
ye
well
awhile
ill
end
my
exhortation
after
dinner
well
we
will
leave
you
then
till
dinnertime
i
must
be
one
of
these
same
dumbwise
men
for
gratiano
never
lets
me
speak
well
keep
me
company
but
two
years
moe
thou
shalt
not
know
the
sound
of
thine
own
tongue
farewell
ill
grow
a
talker
for
this
gear
thanks
i
faith
for
silence
is
only
commendable
in
a
neats
tongue
dried
and
a
maid
not
vendible
is
that
anything
now
gratiano
speaks
an
infinite
deal
of
nothing
more
than
any
man
in
all
venice
his
reasons
are
as
two
grains
of
wheat
hid
in
two
bushels
of
chaff
you
shall
seek
all
day
ere
you
find
them
and
when
you
have
them
they
are
not
worth
the
search
well
tell
me
now
what
lady
is
the
same
to
whom
you
swore
a
secret
pilgrimage
that
you
today
promisd
to
tell
me
of
tis
not
unknown
to
you
antonio
how
much
i
have
disabled
mine
estate
by
something
showing
a
more
swelling
port
than
my
faint
means
would
grant
continuance
nor
do
i
now
make
moan
to
be
abridgd
from
such
a
noble
rate
but
my
chief
care
is
to
come
fairly
off
from
the
great
debts
wherein
my
time
something
too
prodigal
hath
left
me
gagd
to
you
antonio
i
owe
the
most
in
money
and
in
love
and
from
your
love
i
have
a
warranty
to
unburthen
all
my
plots
and
purposes
how
to
get
clear
of
all
the
debts
i
owe
i
pray
you
good
bassanio
let
me
know
it
and
if
it
stand
as
you
yourself
still
do
within
the
eye
of
honour
be
assurd
my
purse
my
person
my
extremest
means
lie
all
unlockd
to
your
occasions
in
my
schooldays
when
i
had
lost
one
shaft
i
shot
his
fellow
of
the
selfsame
flight
the
selfsame
way
with
more
advised
watch
to
find
the
other
forth
and
by
adventuring
both
i
oft
found
both
i
urge
this
childhood
proof
because
what
follows
is
pure
innocence
i
owe
you
much
and
like
a
wilful
youth
that
which
i
owe
is
lost
but
if
you
please
to
shoot
another
arrow
that
self
way
which
you
did
shoot
the
first
i
do
not
doubt
as
i
will
watch
the
aim
or
to
find
both
or
bring
your
latter
hazard
back
again
and
thankfully
rest
debtor
for
the
first
you
know
me
well
and
herein
spend
but
time
to
wind
about
my
love
with
circumstance
and
out
of
doubt
you
do
me
now
more
wrong
in
making
question
of
my
uttermost
than
if
you
had
made
waste
of
all
i
have
then
do
but
say
to
me
what
i
should
do
that
in
your
knowledge
may
by
me
be
done
and
i
am
prest
unto
it
therefore
speak
in
belmont
is
a
lady
richly
left
and
she
is
fair
and
fairer
than
that
word
of
wondrous
virtues
sometimes
from
her
eyes
i
did
receive
fair
speechless
messages
her
name
is
portia
nothing
undervalud
to
catos
daughter
brutus
portia
nor
is
the
wide
world
ignorant
of
her
worth
for
the
four
winds
blow
in
from
every
coast
renowned
suitors
and
her
sunny
locks
hang
on
her
temples
like
a
golden
fleece
which
makes
her
seat
of
belmont
colchos
strond
and
many
jasons
come
in
quest
of
her
o
my
antonio
had
i
but
the
means
to
hold
a
rival
place
with
one
of
them
i
have
a
mind
presages
me
such
thrift
that
i
should
questionless
be
fortunate
thou
knowest
that
all
my
fortunes
are
at
sea
neither
have
i
money
nor
commodity
to
raise
a
present
sum
therefore
go
forth
try
what
my
credit
can
in
venice
do
that
shall
be
rackd
even
to
the
uttermost
to
furnish
thee
to
belmont
to
fair
portia
go
presently
inquire
and
so
will
i
where
money
is
and
i
no
question
make
to
have
it
of
my
trust
or
for
my
sake
by
my
troth
nerissa
my
little
body
is
aweary
of
this
great
world
you
would
be
sweet
madam
if
your
miseries
were
in
the
same
abundance
as
your
good
fortunes
are
and
yet
for
aught
i
see
they
are
as
sick
that
surfeit
with
too
much
as
they
that
starve
with
nothing
it
is
no
mean
happiness
therefore
to
be
seated
in
the
mean
superfluity
comes
sooner
by
white
hairs
but
competency
lives
longer
good
sentences
and
well
pronounced
they
would
be
better
if
well
followed
if
to
do
were
as
easy
as
to
know
what
were
good
to
do
chapels
had
been
churches
and
poor
mens
cottages
princes
palaces
it
is
a
good
divine
that
follows
his
own
instructions
i
can
easier
teach
twenty
what
were
good
to
be
done
than
be
one
of
the
twenty
to
follow
mine
own
teaching
the
brain
may
devise
laws
for
the
blood
but
a
hot
temper
leaps
oer
a
cold
decree
such
a
hare
is
madness
the
youth
to
skip
oer
the
meshes
of
good
counsel
the
cripple
but
this
reasoning
is
not
in
the
fashion
to
choose
me
a
husband
o
me
the
word
choose
i
may
neither
choose
whom
i
would
nor
refuse
whom
i
dislike
so
is
the
will
of
a
living
daughter
curbed
by
the
will
of
a
dead
father
is
it
not
hard
nerissa
that
i
cannot
choose
one
nor
refuse
none
your
father
was
ever
virtuous
and
holy
men
at
their
death
have
good
inspirations
therefore
the
lottery
that
he
hath
devised
in
these
three
chests
of
gold
silver
and
lead
whereof
who
chooses
his
meaning
chooses
you
will
no
doubt
never
be
chosen
by
any
rightly
but
one
who
you
shall
rightly
love
but
what
warmth
is
there
in
your
affection
towards
any
of
these
princely
suitors
that
are
already
come
i
pray
thee
overname
them
and
as
thou
namest
them
i
will
describe
them
and
according
to
my
description
level
at
my
affection
first
there
is
the
neapolitan
prince
ay
thats
a
colt
indeed
for
he
doth
nothing
but
talk
of
his
horse
and
he
makes
it
a
great
appropriation
to
his
own
good
parts
that
he
can
shoe
him
himself
i
am
much
afeard
my
lady
his
mother
played
false
with
a
smith
then
is
there
the
county
palatine
he
doth
nothing
but
frown
as
who
should
say
an
you
will
not
have
me
choose
he
hears
merry
tales
and
smiles
not
i
fear
he
will
prove
the
weeping
philosopher
when
he
grows
old
being
so
full
of
unmannerly
sadness
in
his
youth
i
had
rather
be
married
to
a
deathshead
with
a
bone
in
his
mouth
than
to
either
of
these
god
defend
me
from
these
two
how
say
you
by
the
french
lord
monsieur
le
bon
god
made
him
and
therefore
let
him
pass
for
a
man
in
truth
i
know
it
is
a
sin
to
be
a
mocker
but
he
why
he
hath
a
horse
better
than
the
neapolitans
a
better
bad
habit
of
frowning
than
the
count
palatine
he
is
every
man
in
no
man
if
a
throstle
sing
he
falls
straight
acapering
he
will
fence
with
his
own
shadow
if
i
should
marry
him
i
should
marry
twenty
husbands
if
he
would
despise
me
i
would
forgive
him
for
if
he
love
me
to
madness
i
shall
never
requite
him
what
say
you
then
to
falconbridge
the
young
baron
of
england
you
know
i
say
nothing
to
him
for
he
understands
not
me
nor
i
him
he
hath
neither
latin
french
nor
italian
and
you
will
come
into
the
court
and
swear
that
i
have
a
poor
pennyworth
in
the
english
he
is
a
proper
mans
picture
but
alas
who
can
converse
with
a
dumbshow
how
oddly
he
is
suited
i
think
he
bought
his
doublet
in
italy
his
round
hose
in
france
his
bonnet
in
germany
and
his
behaviour
every
where
what
think
you
of
the
scottish
lord
his
neighbour
that
he
hath
a
neighbourly
charity
in
him
for
he
borrowed
a
box
of
the
ear
of
the
englishman
and
swore
he
would
pay
him
again
when
he
was
able
i
think
the
frenchman
became
his
surety
and
sealed
under
for
another
how
like
you
the
young
german
the
duke
of
saxonys
nephew
very
vilely
in
the
morning
when
he
is
sober
and
most
vilely
in
the
afternoon
when
he
is
drunk
when
he
is
best
he
is
a
little
worse
than
a
man
and
when
he
is
worst
he
is
little
better
than
a
beast
an
the
worst
fall
that
ever
fell
i
hope
i
shall
make
shift
to
go
without
him
if
he
should
offer
to
choose
and
choose
the
right
casket
you
should
refuse
to
perform
your
fathers
will
if
you
should
refuse
to
accept
him
therefore
for
fear
of
the
worst
i
pray
thee
set
a
deep
glass
of
rhenish
wine
on
the
contrary
casket
for
if
the
devil
be
within
and
that
temptation
without
i
know
he
will
choose
it
i
will
do
anything
nerissa
ere
i
will
be
married
to
a
sponge
you
need
not
fear
lady
the
having
any
of
these
lords
they
have
acquainted
me
with
their
determinations
which
is
indeed
to
return
to
their
home
and
to
trouble
you
with
no
more
suit
unless
you
may
be
won
by
some
other
sort
than
your
fathers
imposition
depending
on
the
caskets
if
i
live
to
be
as
old
as
sibylla
i
will
die
as
chaste
as
diana
unless
i
be
obtained
by
the
manner
of
my
fathers
will
i
am
glad
this
parcel
of
wooers
are
so
reasonable
for
there
is
not
one
among
them
but
i
dote
on
his
very
absence
and
i
pray
god
grant
them
a
fair
departure
do
you
not
remember
lady
in
your
fathers
time
a
venetian
a
scholar
and
a
soldier
that
came
hither
in
the
company
of
the
marquis
of
montferrat
yes
yes
it
was
bassanio
as
i
think
he
was
so
called
true
madam
he
of
all
the
men
that
ever
my
foolish
eyes
looked
upon
was
the
best
deserving
a
fair
lady
i
remember
him
well
and
i
remember
him
worthy
of
thy
praise
how
now
what
news
the
four
strangers
seek
for
you
madam
to
take
their
leave
and
there
is
a
forerunner
come
from
a
fifth
the
prince
of
morocco
who
brings
word
the
prince
his
master
will
be
here
tonight
if
i
could
bid
the
fifth
welcome
with
so
good
heart
as
i
can
bid
the
other
four
farewell
i
should
be
glad
of
his
approach
if
he
have
the
condition
of
a
saint
and
the
complexion
of
a
devil
i
had
rather
he
should
shrive
me
than
wive
me
come
nerissa
sirrah
go
before
whiles
we
shut
the
gate
upon
one
wooer
another
knocks
at
the
door
three
thousand
ducats
well
ay
sir
for
three
months
for
three
months
well
for
the
which
as
i
told
you
antonio
shall
be
bound
antonio
shall
become
bound
well
may
you
stead
me
will
you
pleasure
me
shall
i
know
your
answer
three
thousand
ducats
for
three
months
and
antonio
bound
your
answer
to
that
antonio
is
a
good
man
have
you
heard
any
imputation
to
the
contrary
ho
no
no
no
no
my
meaning
in
saying
he
is
a
good
man
is
to
have
you
understand
me
that
he
is
sufficient
yet
his
means
are
in
supposition
he
hath
an
argosy
bound
to
tripolis
another
to
the
indies
i
understand
moreover
upon
the
rialto
he
hath
a
third
at
mexico
a
fourth
for
england
and
other
ventures
he
hath
squandered
abroad
but
ships
are
but
boards
sailors
but
men
there
be
landrats
and
waterrats
landthieves
and
waterthieves
i
mean
pirates
and
then
there
is
the
peril
of
waters
winds
and
rocks
the
man
is
notwithstanding
sufficient
three
thousand
ducats
i
think
i
may
take
his
bond
be
assured
you
may
i
will
be
assured
i
may
and
that
i
may
be
assured
i
will
bethink
me
may
i
speak
with
antonio
if
it
please
you
to
dine
with
us
yes
to
smell
pork
to
eat
of
the
habitation
which
your
prophet
the
nazarite
conjured
the
devil
into
i
will
buy
with
you
sell
with
you
talk
with
you
walk
with
you
and
so
following
but
i
will
not
eat
with
you
drink
with
you
nor
pray
with
you
what
news
on
the
rialto
who
is
he
comes
here
this
is
signior
antonio
how
like
a
fawning
publican
he
looks
i
hate
him
for
he
is
a
christian
but
more
for
that
in
low
simplicity
he
lends
out
money
gratis
and
brings
down
the
rate
of
usance
here
with
us
in
venice
if
i
can
catch
him
once
upon
the
hip
i
will
feed
fat
the
ancient
grudge
i
bear
him
he
hates
our
sacred
nation
and
he
rails
even
there
where
merchants
most
do
congregate
on
me
my
bargains
and
my
wellwon
thrift
which
he
calls
interest
cursed
be
my
tribe
if
i
forgive
him
shylock
do
you
hear
i
am
debating
of
my
present
store
and
by
the
near
guess
of
my
memory
i
cannot
instantly
raise
up
the
gross
of
full
three
thousand
ducats
what
of
that
tubal
a
wealthy
hebrew
of
my
tribe
will
furnish
me
but
soft
how
many
months
do
you
desire
rest
you
fair
good
signior
your
worship
was
the
last
man
in
our
mouths
shylock
albeit
i
neither
lend
nor
borrow
by
taking
nor
by
giving
of
excess
yet
to
supply
the
ripe
wants
of
my
friend
ill
break
a
custom
is
he
yet
possessd
how
much
ye
would
ay
ay
three
thousand
ducats
and
for
three
months
i
had
forgot
three
months
you
told
me
so
well
then
your
bond
and
let
me
see
but
hear
you
methought
you
said
you
neither
lend
nor
borrow
upon
advantage
i
do
never
use
it
when
jacob
grazd
his
uncle
labans
sheep
this
jacob
from
our
holy
abram
was
as
his
wise
mother
wrought
in
his
behalf
the
third
possessor
ay
he
was
the
third
and
what
of
him
did
he
take
interest
no
not
take
interest
not
as
you
would
say
directly
interest
mark
what
jacob
did
when
laban
and
himself
were
compromisd
that
all
the
eanlings
that
were
streakd
and
pied
should
fall
as
jacobs
hire
the
ewes
being
rank
in
end
of
autumn
turned
to
the
rams
and
when
the
work
of
generation
was
between
these
woolly
breeders
in
the
act
the
skilful
shepherd
peeld
me
certain
wands
and
in
the
doing
of
the
deed
of
kind
he
stuck
them
up
before
the
fulsome
ewes
who
then
conceiving
did
in
eaning
time
fall
particolourd
lambs
and
those
were
jacobs
this
was
a
way
to
thrive
and
he
was
blest
and
thrift
is
blessing
if
men
steal
it
not
this
was
a
venture
sir
that
jacob
servd
for
a
thing
not
in
his
power
to
bring
to
pass
but
swayd
and
fashiond
by
the
hand
of
heaven
was
this
inserted
to
make
interest
good
or
is
your
gold
and
silver
ewes
and
rams
i
cannot
tell
i
make
it
breed
as
fast
but
note
me
signior

this
bassanio
the
devil

cite
scripture

his
purpose

and
hedgd
me
by
his
wit
to

his

who

therefore
i
pray
you
lead
me
to

to
try
my

by
this
scimitar
that
slew
the
sophy
and
a
persian
prince
that

three
fields
of
sultan
solyman
i
would
outstare

pluck
the

cubs
from

yea
mock
the

but
alas
the

if
hercules
and
lichas
play
at

which
is
the
better
man
the
greater
throw
may
turn
by
fortune
from
the
weaker
hand
so
is
alcides
beaten
by
his
page
and
so
may
i
blind
fortune
leading
me
miss
that
which
one
unworthier
may
attain
and
die
with
grieving
you
must
take
your
chance
and
either
not
attempt
to
choose
at
all
or
swear
before
you
choose
if
you
choose
wrong
never
to
speak
to
lady
afterward
in

of

therefore
be
advisd

bring
me
unto
my
chance

the
temple
after

your
hazard
shall

then
to

he
saving
your
worships
reverence

hope
an
old
man

very
well
parted

enough

to
the
casements
then
nor
thrust
your
head
into
the
public
street
to

christian
fools

varnishd
faces
but
stop
my
houses

what

that
fool
of
hagars
offspring
ha
his
words
were
farewell
mistress
nothing
else
the
patch

a
huge
feeder
snailslow
in
profit

he
sleeps
by
day
more
than
the
wild
cat
drones
hive
not
with
me
therefore
i
part
with

and
part
with
him
to
one
that

borrowd
purse

this
is
the
penthouse
under
which
lorenzo
desird
us
to
make
stand
his
hour
is
almost
past
and
it
is
marvel
he
outdwells
his
hour
for
lovers
ever
run
before
the
clock
o
ten
times
faster
venus
pigeons
fly
to
seal
loves
bonds
newmade
than
they
are
wont
to
keep
obliged
faith
unforfeited
that
ever
holds
who
riseth
from
a
feast
with
that
keen
appetite
that
he
sits
down
where
is
the
horse
that
doth
untread
again
his
tedious
measures
with
the
unbated
fire
that
he
did
pace
them
first
all
things
that
are
are
with
more
spirit
chased
than
enjoyd
how
like
a
younker
or
a
prodigal
the
scarfed
bark
puts
from
her
native
bay
huggd
and
embraced
by
the
strumpet
wind
how
like
the
prodigal
doth
she
return
with
overweatherd
ribs
and
ragged
sails
lean
rent
and
beggard
by
the
strumpet
wind
here
comes
lorenzo
more
of
this
hereafter

thy
value
with
an
even
hand
if
thou
best
rated
by
thy
estimation
thou
dost
deserve
enough
and
yet
enough
may
not
extend
so
far
as
to
the

yet
to
be
afeard
of
my

a
weak
disabling
of

deserve
her
and
in
fortunes

the
villain
jew
with
outcries
raisd
the
duke
who
went
with
him
to
search
bassanios
ship
he
came
too
late
the
ship
was
under
sail
but
there
the
duke
was
given
to
understand
that
in
a
gondola
were
seen
together
lorenzo
and
his
amorous
jessica
besides
antonio
certified
the
duke
they
were
not
with
bassanio
in
his
ship
i
never
heard
a
passion
so
confusd
so
strange
outrageous
and
so
variable
as
the
dog
jew
did
utter
in
the
streets
my
daughter
o
my
ducats
o
my
daughter
fled
with
a
christian

him
crying
his
stones
his
daughter
and
his
ducats
let
good
antonio
look
he
keep
his
day
or
he
shall
pay
for
this
marry
well
rememberd
i
reasond
with
a
frenchman
yesterday
who
told
me
in
the
narrow
seas
that
part
the
french
and
english
there
miscarried
a
vessel
of
our
country
richly
fraught
i
thought
upon
antonio
when
he
told
me
and
wishd
in
silence
that
it
were
not
his
you
were
best
to
tell
antonio
what
you
hear
yet
do
not
suddenly
for
it
may
grieve
him
a
kinder
gentleman
treads
not
the
earth
i
saw
bassanio
and
antonio
part
bassanio
told
him
he
would
make
some
speed
of
his
return
he
answerd
do
not
so
slubber
not
business
for
my
sake
bassanio
but
stay
the
very
riping
of
the
time
and
for
the
jews
bond
which
he
hath
of
me
let
it
not
enter
in
your
mind
of
love
be
merry
and
employ
your
chiefest
thoughts
to
courtship
and
such
fair
ostents
of
love
as
shall
conveniently
become
you
there
and
even
there
his
eye
being
big
with
tears
turning
his
face
he
put
his
hand
behind
him
and
with
affection
wondrous
sensible
he
wrung
bassanios
hand
and
so
they
parted
i
think
he
only
loves
the
world
for
him
i
pray
thee
let
us
go
and
find
him
out
and
quicken
his
embraced
heaviness
with
some
delight
or
other
do
we
so
quick
quick
i
pray
thee
draw
the
curtain
straight
the
prince
of
arragon
hath
taen
his
oath
and
comes
to
his
election
presently
behold
there

more
speech
my

fortune
of
my
choice

to
leave
you
and

gone
to
these
injunctions
every
one
doth
swear
that

to
hazard
for
my
worthless
self
and
so
have
i
addressd
me
fortune
now
to
my
hearts
hope
gold
silver
and
base
lead
who
chooseth
me
must
give
and
hazard
all
he
hath
you
shall
look
fairer
ere
i
give
or
hazard
what
says
the
golden
chest
ha
let
me
see
who
chooseth
me
shall
gain
what
many
men
desire
what
many
men
desire
that
many
may
be
meant
by
the
fool
multitude
that
choose
by
show
not
learning
more
than
the
fond
eye
doth
teach
which
pries
not
to
the
interior
but
like
the
martlet
builds
in
the
weather
on
the
outward
wall
even
in
the
force
and
road
of
casualty
i
will
not
choose
what
many
men
desire
because
i
will
not
jump
with
common
spirits
and
rank
me
with
the
barbarous
multitude
why
then
to
thee
thou
silver
treasurehouse
tell
me
once
more
what
title
thou
dost
bear
who
chooseth
me
shall
get
as
much
as
he
deserves
and
well
said
too
for
who
shall
go
about
to
cozen
fortune
and
be
honourable
without
the
stamp
of
merit
let
none
presume
to
wear
an
undeserved
dignity
o
that
estates
degrees
and
offices
were
not
derivd
corruptly
and
that
clear
honour
were
purchasd
by
the
merit
of
the
wearer
how
many
then
should
cover
that
stand
bare
how
many
be
commanded
that
command
how
much
low
peasantry
would
then
be
gleand
from
the
true
seed
of
honour
and
how
much
honour
pickd
from
the
chaff
and
ruin
of
the
times
to
be
new
varnishd
well
but
to
my
choice
who
chooseth
me
shall
get
as
much
as
he
deserves
i
will
assume
desert
give
me
a
key
for
this
and

young
venetian
one
that

approaching
of
his
lord
from
whom
he
bringeth
sensible
regreets
to
wit
besides
commends
and
courteous
breath
gifts
of
rich
value

a
day
in
april

so
sweet
to
show
how
costly
summer
was
at
hand
as
this
forespurrer
comes
before

am
half
afeard

highday
wit
in

so
mannerly
bassanio
lord
love
if
thy
will
it
be
now
what
news
on
the
rialto
why
yet
it
lives
there
unchecked
that
antonio
hath
a
ship
of
rich
lading
wracked
on
the
narrow
seas
the
goodwins
i
think
they
call
the
place
a
very
dangerous
flat
and
fatal
where
the
carcasses
of
many
a
tall
ship
lie
buried
as
they
say
if
my
gossip
report
be
an
honest
woman
of
her
word
i
would
she
were
as
lying
a
gossip
in
that
as
ever
knapped
ginger
or
made
her
neighbours
believe
she
wept
for
the
death
of
a
third
husband
but
it
is
true
without
any
slips
of
prolixity
or
crossing
the
plain
highway
of
talk
that
the
good
antonio
the
honest
antonio
o
that
i
had
a
title
good
enough
to
keep
his
name
company
come
the
full
stop
ha
what
sayst
thou
why
the
end
is
he
hath
lost
a
ship
i
would
it
might
prove
the
end
of
his
losses
let
me
say
amen
betimes
lest
the
devil
cross
my
prayer
for
here
he
comes
in
the
likeness
of
a
jew
how
now
shylock
what
news
among
the
merchants
you
knew
none
so
well
none
so
well
as
you
of
my
daughters
flight
thats
certain
i
for
my
part
knew
the
tailor
that
made
the
wings
she
flew
withal
and
shylock
for
his
own
part
knew
the
bird
was
fledged
and
then
it
is
the
complexion
of
them
all
to
leave
the
dam
she
is
damned
for
it
thats
certain
if
the
devil
may
be
her
judge
my
own
flesh
and
blood
to
rebel
out
upon
it
old
carrion
rebels
it
at
these
years
i
say
my
daughter
is
my
flesh
and
blood
there
is
more
difference
between
thy
flesh
and
hers
than
between
jet
and
ivory
more
between
your
bloods
than
there
is
between
red
wine
and
rhenish
but
tell
us
do
you
hear
whether
antonio
have
had
any
loss
at
sea

another
bad

prodigal

scarce
show
his
head
on
the
rialto

to
come
so
smug
upon
the
mart

him
look
to
his
bond
he
was
wont
to
call
me
usurer
let
him
look
to
his
bond
he
was
wont
to
lend
money
for
a
christian
courtesy
let
him
look
to
his
bond
why
i
am
sure
if
he
forfeit
thou
wilt
not
take
his
flesh
whats
that
good
for
to
bait
fish
withal
if
it
will
feed
nothing

feed
my
revenge

disgraced
me
and
hindered

a
million

at
my
losses
mocked
at
my
gains
scorned
my
nation
thwarted
my
bargains

to
the
same
diseases
healed
by
the
same
means
warmed
and
cooled
by
the

winter
and

as
a
christian
is
if
you
prick
us
do
we
not
bleed
if
you
tickle
us
do
we
not
laugh
if
you
poison
us
do
we

not
revenge
if
we
are
like

in
the
rest
we
will
resemble
you
in
that
if

not
have
given
it
for
a
wilderness
of
monkeys
but
antonio
is
certainly
undone
nay
thats
true
thats
very
true
go
tubal
fee
me
an
officer
bespeak
him
a
fortnight
before
i
will
have
the
heart
of
him
if
he
forfeit
for
were
he
out
of
venice
i
can
make
what
merchandise
i
will
go
go
tubal
and
meet
me
at
our
synagogue
go
good
tubal
at
our
synagogue
tubal
i
pray
you
tarry
pause
a
day
or
two
before
you
hazard
for
in
choosing
wrong
i
lose
your
company
therefore
forbear
awhile
theres
something
tells
me
but
it
is
not
love
i
would
not
lose
you
and
you
know
yourself
hate
counsels
not
in
such
a
quality
but
lest
you
should
not
understand
me
well
and
yet
a
maiden
hath
no
tongue
but
thought
i
would
detain
you
here
some
month
or
two
before
you
venture
for
me
i
could
teach
you
how
to
choose
right
but
then
i
am
forsworn
so
will
i
never
be
so
may
you
miss
me
but
if
you
do
youll
make
me
wish
a
sin
that
i
had
been
forsworn
beshrew
your
eyes
they
have
oerlookd
me
and
divided
me
one
half
of
me
is
yours
the
other
half
yours
mine
own
i
would
say
but
if
mine
then
yours
and
so
all
yours
o
these
naughty
times
put
bars
between
the
owners
and
their
rights
and
so
though
yours
not
yours
prove
it
so
let
fortune
go
to
hell
for
it
not
i
i
speak
too
long
but
tis
to
peise
the
time
to
eke
it
and
to
draw
it
out
in
length
to
stay
you
from
election
let
me
choose
for
as
i
am
i
live
upon
the
rack
upon
the
rack
bassanio
then
confess
what
treason
there
is
mingled
with
your
love
none
but
that
ugly
treason
of
mistrust
which
makes
me
fear
th
enjoying
of
my
love
there
may
as
well
be
amity
and
life
tween
snow
and
fire
as
treason
and
my
love
ay
but
i
fear
you
speak
upon
the
rack
where
men
enforced
do
speak
anything
promise
me
life
and
ill
confess
the
truth
well
then
confess
and
live
confess
and
love
had
been
the
very
sum
of
my
confession
o
happy
torment
when
my
torturer
doth
teach
me
answers
for
deliverance
but
let
me
to
my
fortune
and
the
caskets
away
then
i
am
lockd
in
one
of
them
if
you
do
love
me
you
will
find
me
out
nerissa
and
the
rest
stand
all
aloof
let
music
sound
while
he
doth
make
his
choice
then
if
he
lose
he
makes
a
swanlike
end
fading
in
music
that
the
comparison
may
stand
more
proper
my
eye
shall
be
the
stream
and
watery
deathbed
for
him
he
may
win
and
what
is
music
then
then
music
is
even
as
the
flourish
when
true
subjects
bow
to
a
newcrowned
monarch
such
it
is
as
are
those
dulcet
sounds
in
break
of
day
that
creep
into
the
dreaming
bridegrooms
ear
and
summon
him
to
marriage
now
he
goes
with
no
less
presence
but
with
much
more
love
than
young
alcides
when
he
did
redeem
the
virgin
tribute
paid
by
howling
troy
to
the
seamonster
i
stand
for
sacrifice
the
rest
aloof
are
the
dardanian
wives
with
bleared
visages
come
forth
to
view
the
issue
of
the
exploit
go
hercules
live
thou
i
live
with
much
much
more
dismay
i
view
the
fight
than
thou
that
makst

tell
me
where
is

in

or
in

so
may
the

the

what

so
tainted

being

obscures
the

what

some

will
bless

and
approve
it
with
a

grossness
with

there
is
no
vice
so
simple
but
assumes
some
mark
of
virtue
on
his
outward

how
many
cowards
whose

are
all
as
false
as

wear

wanton
gambols

supposed
fairness
often
known
to
be
the
dowry
of
a

the

here
are

lips
parted

so
sweet
a

should
sunder
such
sweet

here
in

the

plays
the
spider
and
hath
woven
a
golden
mesh
to
entrap
the
hearts
of
men
faster
than

in

but
her
eyes
how
could
he
see
to
do
them
having
made
one
methinks
it
should
have
power
to
steal
both
his
and
leave
itself
unfurnishd
yet
look
how
far
the
substance
of
my
praise
doth
wrong
this
shadow
in
underprizing
it
so
far
this
shadow
doth
limp
behind
the
substance
heres
the
scroll
the
continent
and
summary
of
my
fortune
you
that
choose
not
by
the
view
chance
as
fair
and
choose
as
true
since
this
fortune
falls
to
you
be
content
and
seek
no
new
if
you
be
well
pleasd
with
this
and
hold
your
fortune
for
your
bliss
turn
you
where
your
lady
is
and
claim
her
with
a
loving
kiss
a
gentle
scroll
fair
lady
by
your
leave
i
come
by
note
to
give
and
to
receive
like
one
of
two
contending
in
a
prize
that
thinks
he
hath
done
well
in
peoples
eyes
hearing
applause
and
universal
shout
giddy
in
spirit
still
gazing
in
a
doubt
whether
those
peals
of
praise
be
his
or
no
so
thricefair
lady
stand
i
even
so
as
doubtful
whether
what
i
see
be
true
until
confirmd
signd
ratified
by
you
you
see
me
lord
bassanio
where
i
stand
such
as
i
am
though
for
myself
alone
i
would
not
be
ambitious
in
my
wish
to
wish
myself
much
better
yet
for
you
i
would
be
trebled
twenty
times
myself
a
thousand
times
more
fair
ten
thousand
times
more
rich
that
only
to
stand
high
in
your
account
i
might
in
virtues
beauties
livings
friends
exceed
account
but
the
full
sum
of
me
is
sum
of
nothing
which
to
term
in
gross
is
an
unlessond
girl
unschoold
unpractisd
happy
in
this
she
is
not
yet
so
old
but
she
may
learn
happier
than
this
she
is
not
bred
so
dull
but
she
can
learn
happiest
of
all
is
that
her
gentle
spirit
commits
itself
to
yours
to
be
directed
as
from
her
lord
her
governor
her
king
myself
and
what
is
mine
to
you
and
yours
is
now
converted
but
now
i
was
the
lord
of
this
fair
mansion
master
of
my
servants
queen
oer
myself
and
even
now
but
now
this
house
these
servants
and
this
same
myself
are
yours
my
lord
i
give
them
with
this
ring
which
when
you
part
from
lose
or
give
away
let
it
presage
the
ruin
of
your
love
and
be
my
vantage
to
exclaim
on
you
madam
you
have
bereft
me
of
all
words
only
my
blood
speaks
to
you
in
my
veins
and
there
is
such
confusion
in
my
powers
as
after
some
oration
fairly
spoke
by
a
beloved
prince
there
doth
appear
among
the
buzzing
pleased
multitude
where
every
something
being
blent
together
turns
to
a
wild
of
nothing
save
of
joy
expressd
and
not
expressd
but
when
this
ring
parts
from
this
finger
then
parts
life
from
hence
o
then
be
bold
to
say
bassanios
dead
my
lord
and
lady
it
is
now
our
time
that
have
stood
by
and
seen
our
wishes
prosper
to
cry
good
joy
good
joy
my
lord
and
lady
my
lord
bassanio
and
my
gentle
lady
i
wish
you
all
the
joy
that
you
can
wish
for
i
am
sure
you
can
wish
none
from
me
and
when
your
honours
mean
to
solemnize
the
bargain
of
your
faith
i
do
beseech
you
even
at
that
time
i
may
be
married
too
with
all
my
heart
so
thou
canst
get
a
wife
i
thank
your
lordship
you
have
got
me
one
my
eyes

lord
can
look
as
swift
as
yours
you
saw
the
mistress
i
beheld
the
maid
you
lovd
i
lovd
for
intermission
no
more
pertains
to
me
my
lord
than
you
your
fortune
stood
upon
the
caskets
there
and
so
did
mine
too
as
the
matter
falls
for
wooing
here
until
i
sweat
again
and
swearing
till
my
very
roof
was
dry
with
oaths
of
love
at
last
if
promise
last
i
got
a
promise
of
this
fair
one
here
to
have
her
love

that
your
fortune
achievd
her
mistress
is
this
true
nerissa

my
part

purpose

the
way
he
did
entreat
me
past
all
saying

did
my
lord
and
i
have
reason
for
it
signior

to
you

ope

letter
i
pray
you
tell
me
how
my
good
friend
doth
not
sick

lord

letter

estate
nerissa

yon
stranger
bid
her
welcome

news
from
venice
how
doth
that
royal
merchant
good
antonio
i
know
he
will
be
glad
of
our
success
we
are
the
jasons
we
have
won
the
fleece
i
would
you
had
won
the
fleece
that
he
hath
lost
there
are
some
shrewd
contents
in
yon
same
paper
that
steal
the
colour
from
bassanios
cheek
some
dear
friend
dead
else
nothing
in
the
world
could
turn
so
much
the
constitution
of
any
constant
man
what
worse
and
worse
with
leave
bassanio
i
am
half
yourself
and
i
must
freely
have
the
half
of
anything
that
this
same
paper
brings
you
o
sweet
portia
here
are
a
few
of
the
unpleasantst
words
that
ever
blotted
paper
gentle
lady
when
i
did
first
impart
my
love
to
you
i
freely
told
you
all
the
wealth
i
had
ran
in
my
veins
i
was
a
gentleman
and
then
i
told
you
true
and
yet
dear
lady
rating
myself
at
nothing
you
shall
see
how
much
i
was
a
braggart
when
i
told
you
my
state
was
nothing
i
should
then
have
told
you
that
i
was
worse
than
nothing
for
indeed
i
have
engagd
myself
to
a
dear
friend
engagd
my
friend
to
his
mere
enemy
to
feed
my
means
here
is
a
letter
lady
the
paper
as
the
body
of
my
friend
and
every
word
in
it
a
gaping
wound
issuing
lifeblood
but
is
it
true
salanio
hath
all
his
ventures
faild
what
not
one
hit
from
tripolis
from
mexico
and
england
from
lisbon
barbary
and
india
and
not
one
vessel
scape
the
dreadful
touch
of
merchantmarring
rocks
not
one
my
lord
besides
it
should
appear
that
if
he
had
the
present
money
to
discharge
the
jew
he
would
not
take
it
never
did
i
know
a
creature
that
did
bear
the
shape
of
man
so
keen
and
greedy
to
confound
a
man
he
plies
the
duke
at
morning
and
at
night
and
doth
impeach
the
freedom
of
the
state
if
they
deny
him
justice
twenty
merchants
the
duke
himself
and
the
magnificoes
of
greatest
port
have
all
persuaded
with
him
but
none
can
drive
him
from
the
envious
plea
of
forfeiture
of
justice
and
his
bond
when
i
was
with
him
i
have
heard
him
swear
to
tubal
and
to
chus
his
countrymen
that
he
would
rather
have
antonios
flesh
than
twenty
times
the
value
of
the
sum
that
he
did
owe
him
and
i
know
my
lord
if
law
authority
and
power
deny
not
it
will
go
hard
with
poor
antonio
is
it
your
dear
friend
that
is
thus
in
trouble
the
dearest
friend
to
me
the
kindest
man
the
bestconditiond
and
unwearied
spirit
in
doing
courtesies
and
one
in
whom
the
ancient
roman
honour
more
appears
than
any
that
draws
breath
in
italy
what
sum
owes
he
the
jew
for
me
three
thousand
ducats
what
no
more
pay
him
six
thousand
and
deface
the
bond
double
six
thousand
and
then
treble
that
before
a
friend
of
this
description
shall
lose
a
hair
thorough
bassanios
fault
first
go
with
me
to
church
and
call
me
wife
and
then
away
to
venice
to
your
friend
for
never
shall
you
lie
by
portias

an
unquiet
soul

petty
debt

i
have
sworn
an
oath
that
i
will
have
my
bond
thou
calldst
me
dog
before
thou
hadst
a
cause
but
since
i
am
a
dog
beware
my
fangs
the
duke
shall
grant
me
justice
i
do
wonder
thou
naughty
gaoler
that
thou
art
so
fond
to
come
abroad
with
him
at
his
request
i
pray
thee
hear
me
speak
ill
have
my
bond
i
will
not
hear
thee
speak
ill
have
my
bond
and
therefore
speak
no
more
ill
not
be
made
a
soft
and
dulleyed
fool
to
shake
the
head
relent
and
sigh
and
yield
to
christian
intercessors
follow
not
ill
have
no
speaking
i
will
have
my
bond
it
is
the
most
impenetrable
cur
that
ever
kept
with
men
let
him
alone
ill
follow
him
no
more
with
bootless
prayers
he
seeks
my
life
his
reason
well
i
know
i
oft
deliverd
from
his
forfeitures
many
that
have
at
times
made
moan
to
me
therefore
he
hates
me
i
am
sure
the
duke
will
never
grant
this
forfeiture
to
hold
the
duke
cannot
deny
the
course
of
law
for
the
commodity
that
strangers
have
with
us
in
venice
if
it
be
denied
twill
much
impeach
the
justice
of
the
state
since
that
the
trade
and
profit
of
the
city
consisteth
of
all
nations
therefore
go
these
griefs
and
losses
have
so
bated
me
that
i
shall
hardly
spare
a
pound
of
flesh
tomorrow
to
my
bloody
creditor
well
gaoler
on
pray
god
bassanio
come
to
see
me
pay
his
debt
and
then
i
care
not
madam
although
i
speak
it
in
your
presence
you
have
a
noble
and
a
true
conceit
of
godlike
amity
which
appears
most
strongly
in
bearing
thus
the
absence
of
your
lord
but
if
you
knew
to
whom
you
show
this
honour
how
true
a
gentleman
you
send
relief
how
dear
a
lover
of
my
lord
your
husband
i
know
you
would
be
prouder
of
the
work
than
customary
bounty
can
enforce
you
i
never
did
repent
for
doing
good
nor
shall
not
now
for
in
companions
that
do
converse
and
waste
the
time
together
whose
souls
do
bear
an
equal
yoke
of
love
there
must
be
needs
a
like
proportion
of
lineaments
of
manners
and
of
spirit
which
makes
me
think
that
this
antonio
being
the
bosom
lover
of
my
lord
must
needs
be
like
my
lord
if
it
be
so
how
little
is
the
cost
i
have
bestowd
in
purchasing
the
semblance
of
my
soul
from
out
the
state
of
hellish
cruelty
this
comes
too
near
the
praising
of
myself
therefore
no
more
of
it
hear
other
things
lorenzo
i
commit
into
your
hands
the
husbandry
and
manage
of
my
house
until
my
lords
return
for
mine
own
part
i
have
toward
heaven
breathd
a
secret
vow
to
live
in
prayer
and
contemplation
only
attended
by
nerissa
here
until
her
husband
and
my
lords
return
there
is
a
monastery
two
miles

there
will
we
abide

do
desire

which

necessity

a
habit

they
shall
think
we

accomplished

that
we
lack
ill
hold
thee
any
wager
when
we
are
both
accoutred
like
young
men
ill
prove
the
prettier
fellow
of
the
two
and
wear
my
dagger
with
the
braver
grace
and
speak
between
the
change
of
man
and
boy
with
a
reed
voice
and
turn
two
mincing
steps
into
a
manly
stride
and
speak
of
frays
like
a
fine
bragging
youth
and
tell
quaint
lies
how
honourable
ladies
sought
my
love
which
i
denying
they
fell
sick
and
died
i
could
not
do
withal
then
ill
repent
and
wish
for
all
that
that
i
had
not
killd
them
and
twenty
of
these
puny
lies
ill
tell
that
men
shall
swear
i
have
discontinud
school
above
a
twelvemonth
i
have
within
my
mind
a
thousand
raw
tricks
of
these
bragging
jacks
which
i
will
practise
why
shall
we
turn
to
men
fie
what
a
questions
that
if
thou
wert
near
a
lewd
interpreter
but
come
ill
tell
thee
all
my
whole
device
when
i
am
in
my
coach
which
stays
for
us
at
the
park
gate
and
therefore
haste
away
for
we
must
measure
twenty
miles
today
yes
truly
for
look
you
the
sins
of
the
father
are
to
be
laid
upon
the
children
therefore
i
promise
you
i
fear
you
i
was
always
plain
with
you
and
so
now
i
speak
my
agitation
of
the
matter
therefore
be
of
good
cheer
for
truly
i
think
you
are
damned
there
is
but
one
hope
in
it
that
can
do
you
any
good
and
that
is
but
a
kind
of
bastard
hope
neither
and
what
hope
is
that
i
pray
thee
marry
you
may
partly
hope
that
your
father
got
you
not
that
you
are
not
the
jews
daughter
that
were
a
kind
of
bastard
hope
indeed
so
the
sins
of
my
mother
should
be
visited
upon
me
truly
then
i
fear
you
are
damned
both
by
father
and
mother
thus
when
i
shun
scylla
your
father
i
fall
into
charybdis
your
mother
well
you
are
gone
both
ways
i
shall
be
saved
by
my
husband
he
hath
made
me
a
christian
truly
the
more
to
blame
he
we
were
christians
enow
before
een
as
many
as
could
well
live
one
by
another
this
making
of
christians
will
raise
the
price
of
hogs
if
we
grow
all
to
be
porkeaters
we
shall
not
shortly
have
a
rasher
on
the
coals
for
money
ill
tell
my
husband
launcelot
what
you
say
here
he
comes
i
shall
grow
jealous
of
you
shortly
launcelot
if
you
thus
get
my
wife
into
corners
nay
you
need
not
fear
us
lorenzo
launcelot
and
i
are
out
he
tells
me
flatly
there
is
no
mercy
for
me
in
heaven
because
i
am
a
jews
daughter
and
he
says
you
are
no
good
member
of
the
commonwealth
for
in
converting
jews
to
christians
you
raise
the
price
of
pork
i
shall
answer
that
better
to
the
commonwealth
than
you
can
the
getting
up
of
the
negros
belly
the
moor
is
with
child
by
you
launcelot
it
is
much
that
the
moor
should
be
more
than
reason
but
if
she
be
less
than
an
honest
woman
she
is
indeed
more
than
i
took
her
for
how
every
fool
can
play
upon
the
word
i
think
the
best
grace
of
wit
will
shortly
turn
into
silence
and
discourse
grow
commendable
in
none
only
but
parrots
go
in
sirrah

know
my
duty
yet
more
quarrelling
with

show
the
whole
wealth
of
thy
wit
in
an
instant
i
pray
thee
understand
a
plain
man
in
his
plain
meaning
go
to
thy
fellows
bid
them
cover
the
table
serve
in
the
meat
and
we
will
come
in
to

the

shall
be
served
in
for
the
meat
sir

sir
why
let

be
as
humours
and
conceits

dear
discretion
how
his
words
are
suited
the
fool

planted
in
his
memory
an
army
of
good
words
and
i
do
know
a
many
fools
that
stand
in
better
place
garnishd

having
such
a
blessing
in

the
joys
of
heaven
here
on
earth
and
if
on
earth
he
do
not
mean

then
in
reason

why
if
two
gods

some
heavenly
match
and
on
the
wager
lay
two
earthly
women
and
portia

there
must
be
something

the
poor
rude
world

her
fellow
even
such
a
husband

for
a
wife

ready
so
please
your
grace
i
am
sorry
for
thee
thou
art
come
to
answer
a
stony
adversary
an
inhuman
wretch
uncapable
of
pity
void
and
empty
from
any
dram
of
mercy
i
have
heard
your
grace
hath
taen
great
pains
to
qualify
his
rigorous
course
but
since
he
stands
obdurate
and
that
no
lawful
means
can
carry
me
out
of
his
envys
reach
i
do
oppose
my
patience
to
his
fury
and
am
armd
to
suffer
with
a
quietness
of
spirit
the
very
tyranny
and
rage
of
his
go
one
and
call
the
jew
into
the
court
hes
ready
at
the
door
he
comes
my
lord
make
room
and
let
him
stand
before
our
face
shylock
the
world
thinks
and
i
think
so
too
that
thou
but
leadst
this
fashion
of
thy
malice
to
the
last
hour
of
act
and
then
tis
thought
thoult
show
thy
mercy
and
remorse
more
strange
than
is
thy
strangeapparent
cruelty
and
where
thou
now
exactst
the
penalty
which
is
a
pound
of
this
poor
merchants
flesh
thou
wilt
not
only
loose
the
forfeiture
but
touchd
with
human
gentleness
and
love
forgive
a
moiety
of
the
principal
glancing
an
eye
of
pity
on
his
losses
that
have
of
late
so
huddled
on
his
back
enow
to
press
a
royal
merchant
down
and
pluck
commiseration
of
his
state
from
brassy
bosoms
and
rough
hearts
of
flint
from
stubborn
turks
and
tartars
never
traind
to
offices
of
tender
courtesy
we
all
expect
a
gentle
answer
jew
i
have
possessd
your
grace
of
what
i
purpose
and
by
our
holy
sabbath
have
i
sworn
to
have
the
due
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
if
you
deny
it
let
the
danger
light
upon
your
charter
and
your
citys
freedom
youll
ask
me
why
i
rather
choose
to
have
a
weight
of
carrion
flesh
than
to
receive
three
thousand
ducats
ill
not
answer
that
but
say
it
is
my
humour
is
it
answerd
what
if
my
house
be
troubled
with
a
rat
and
i
be
pleasd
to
give
ten
thousand
ducats
to
have
it
band
what
are
you
answerd
yet
some
men
there
are
love
not
a
gaping
pig
some
that
are
mad
if
they
behold
a
cat
and
others
when
the
bagpipe
sings
i
the
nose
cannot
contain
their
urine
for
affection
mistress
of
passion
sways
it
to
the
mood
of
what
it
likes
or
loathes
now
for
your
answer
as
there
is
no
firm
reason
to
be
renderd
why
he
cannot
abide
a
gaping
pig
why
he
a
harmless
necessary
cat
why
he
a
wauling
bagpipe
but
of
force
must
yield
to
such
inevitable
shame
as
to
offend
himself
being
offended
so
can
i
give
no
reason
nor
i
will
not
more
than
a
lodgd
hate
and
a
certain
loathing
i
bear
antonio
that
i
follow
thus
a
losing
suit
against
him
are
you
answerd
this
is
no
answer
thou
unfeeling
man
to
excuse
the
current
of
thy
cruelty
i
am
not
bound
to
please
thee
with
my
answer
do
all
men
kill
the
things
they
do
not
love
hates
any
man
the
thing
he
would
not
kill
every
offence
is
not
a
hate
at
first
what
wouldst
thou
have
a
serpent
sting
thee
twice
i
pray
you
think
you
question
with
the
jew
you
may
as
well
go
stand
upon
the
beach
and
bid
the
main
flood
bate
his
usual
height
you
may
as
well
use
question
with
the
wolf
why
he
hath
made
the
ewe
bleat
for
the
lamb
you
may
as
well
forbid
the
mountain
pines
to
wag
their
high
tops
and
to
make
no
noise
when
they
are
fretted
with
the
gusts
of
heaven
you
may
as
well
do
anything
most
hard
as
seek
to
soften
that
than
which
whats
harder
his
jewish
heart
therefore
i
do
beseech
you
make
no
more
offers
use
no
further
means
but
with
all
brief
and
plain
conveniency
let
me
have
judgment
and
the
jew
his
will
for
thy
three
thousand
ducats
here
is
six
if
every
ducat
in
six
thousand
ducats
were
in
six
parts
and
every
part
a
ducat
i
would
not
draw
them
i
would
have
my
bond
how
shalt
thou
hope
for
mercy
rendering
none
what
judgment
shall
i
dread
doing
no
wrong
you
have
among
you
many
a
purchasd
slave
which
like
your
asses
and
your
dogs
and
mules
you
use
in
abject
and
in
slavish
parts
because
you
bought
them
shall
i
say
to
you
let
them
be
free
marry
them
to
your
heirs
why
sweat
they
under
burdens
let
their
beds
be
made
as
soft
as
yours
and
let
their
palates
be
seasond
with
such
viands
you
will
answer
the
slaves
are
ours
so
do
i
answer
you
the
pound
of
flesh
which
i
demand
of
him
is
dearly
bought
tis
mine
and
i
will
have
it
if
you
deny
me
fie
upon
your
law
there
is
no
force
in
the
decrees
of
venice
i
stand
for
judgment
answer
shall
i
have
it
upon
my
power
i
may
dismiss
this
court
unless
bellario
a
learned
doctor
whom
i
have
sent
for
to
determine
this
come
here
today
my
lord
here
stays
without
a
messenger
with
letters
from
the
doctor
new
come
from
padua
bring
us
the
letters

the
messenger
good
cheer

the
jew

have
my
flesh

bones
and
all
ere
thou
shalt
lose
for
me
one
drop
of
blood
i
am
a
tainted
wether
of
the
flock
meetest
for
death
the
weakest
kind
of
fruit
drops
earliest
to
the
ground
and
so
let
me
you
cannot
better
be
employd
bassanio
than
to
live
still
and
write
mine
epitaph
came
you
from
padua
from
bellario
from
both
my
lord
bellario
greets
your
grace
why
dost
thou
whet
thy
knife
so
earnestly
to
cut
the
forfeiture
from
that
bankrupt
there
not
on
thy
sole
but
on
thy
soul
harsh
jew
thou
makst
thy
knife
keen
but
no
metal
can
no
not
the
hangmans
axe
bear
half
the
keenness
of
thy
sharp
envy
can
no
prayers
pierce
thee
no
none
that
thou
hast
wit
enough
to
make
o
be
thou
damnd
inexecrable
dog
and
for
thy
life
let
justice
be
accusd
thou
almost
makst
me
waver
in
my
faith
to
hold
opinion
with
pythagoras
that
souls
of
animals
infuse
themselves
into
the
trunks
of
men
thy
currish
spirit
governd
a
wolf
who
hangd
for
human
slaughter
even
from
the
gallows
did
his
fell
soul
fleet
and
whilst
thou
layst
in
thy
unhallowd
dam
infusd
itself
in
thee
for
thy
desires
are
wolfish
bloody
starvd
and
ravenous
till
thou
canst
rail
the
seal
from
off
my
bond
thou
but
offendst
thy
lungs
to
speak
so
loud
repair
thy
wit
good
youth
or
it
will
fall
to
cureless
ruin
i
stand
here
for
law
this
letter
from
bellario
doth
commend
a
young
and
learned
doctor
to
our
court
where
is
he
he
attendeth
here
hard
by
to
know
your
answer
whether
youll
admit
him
with
all
my
heart
some
three
or
four
of
you
go
give
him
courteous
conduct
to
this
place
meantime
the
court
shall
hear
bellarios
letter
your
grace
shall
understand
that
at
the
receipt
of
your
letter
i
am
very
sick
but
in
the
instant
that
your
messenger
came
in
loving
visitation
was
with
me
a
young
doctor
of
rome
his
name
is
balthazar
i
acquainted
him
with
the
cause
in
controversy
between
the
jew
and
antonio
the
merchant
we
turned
oer
many
books
together
he
is
furnished
with
my
opinion
which
bettered
with
his
own
learning
the
greatness
whereof
i
cannot
enough
commend
comes
with
him
at
my
importunity
to
fill
up
your
graces
request
in
my
stead
i
beseech
you
let
his
lack
of
years
be
no
impediment
to
let
him
lack
a
reverend
estimation
for
i
never
knew
so
young
a
body
with
so
old
a
head
i
leave
him
to
your
gracious
acceptance
whose
trial
shall
better
publish
his
commendation
you
hear
the
learnd
bellario
what
he
writes
and
here
i
take
it
is
the
doctor
come
give
me
your
hand
came
you
from
old
bellario
i
did
my
lord
you
are
welcome
take
your
place
are
you
acquainted
with
the
difference
that
holds
this
present
question
in
the
court
i
am
informed
throughly
of
the
cause
which
is
the
merchant
here
and
which
the
jew
antonio
and
old
shylock
both
stand
forth
is
your
name
shylock
shylock
is
my
name
of
a
strange
nature
is
the
suit
you
follow
yet
in
such
rule
that
the
venetian
law
cannot
impugn
you
as
you
do
proceed
you
stand
within
his
danger
do
you
not
ay
so
he
says
do
you
confess
the
bond
i
do
then
must
the
jew
be
merciful
on
what
compulsion
must
i
tell
me
that
the
quality
of
mercy
is
not
straind
it
droppeth
as
the
gentle
rain
from
heaven
upon
the
place
beneath
it
is
twice
blessd
it
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
tis
mightiest
in
the
mightiest
it
becomes
the
throned
monarch
better
than
his
crown
his
sceptre
shows
the
force
of
temporal
power
the
attribute
to
awe
and
majesty
wherein
doth
sit
the
dread
and
fear
of
kings
but
mercy
is
above
this
sceptred
sway
it
is
enthroned
in
the
hearts
of
kings
it
is
an
attribute
to
god
himself
and
earthly
power
doth
then
show
likest
gods
when
mercy
seasons
justice
therefore
jew
though
justice
be
thy
plea
consider
this
that
in
the
course
of
justice
none
of
us
should
see
salvation
we
do
pray
for
mercy
and
that
same
prayer
doth
teach
us
all
to
render
the
deeds
of
mercy
i
have
spoke
thus
much
to
mitigate
the
justice
of
thy
plea
which
if
thou
follow
this
strict
court
of
venice
must
needs
give
sentence
gainst
the
merchant
there
my
deeds
upon
my
head
i
crave
the
law
the
penalty
and
forfeit
of
my
bond
is
he
not
able
to
discharge
the
money
yes
here
i
tender
it
for
him
in
the
court
yea
twice
the
sum
if
that
will
not
suffice
i
will
be
bound
to
pay
it
ten
times
oer
on
forfeit
of
my
hands
my
head
my
heart
if
this
will
not
suffice
it
must
appear
that
malice
bears
down
truth
and
i
beseech
you
wrest
once
the
law
to
your
authority
to
do
a
great
right
do
a
little
wrong
and
curb
this
cruel
devil
of
his
will
it
must
not
be
there
is
no
power
in
venice
can
alter
a
decree
established
twill
be
recorded
for
a
precedent
and
many
an
error
by
the
same
example
will
rush
into
the
state
it
cannot
be
a
daniel
come
to
judgment
yea
a
daniel
o
wise
young
judge
how
i
do
honour
thee
i
pray
you
let
me
look
upon
the
bond
here
tis
most
reverend
doctor
here
it
is
shylock
theres
thrice
thy
money
offerd
thee
an
oath
an
oath
i
have
an
oath
in
heaven
shall
i
lay
perjury
upon
my
soul
no
not
for
venice
why
this
bond
is
forfeit
and
lawfully
by
this
the
jew
may
claim
a
pound
of
flesh
to
be
by
him
cut
off
nearest
the
merchants
heart
be
merciful
take
thrice
thy
money
bid
me
tear
the
bond
when
it
is
paid
according
to
the
tenour
it
doth
appear
you
are
a
worthy
judge
you
know
the
law
your
exposition
hath
been
most
sound
i
charge
you
by
the
law
whereof
you
are
a
welldeserving
pillar
proceed
to
judgment
by
my
soul
i
swear
there
is
no
power
in
the
tongue
of
man
to
alter
me
i
stay
here
on
my
bond
most
heartily
i
do
beseech
the
court
to
give
the
judgment
why
then
thus
it
is
you
must
prepare
your
bosom
for
his
knife
o
noble
judge
o
excellent
young
man
for
the
intent
and
purpose
of
the
law
hath
full
relation
to
the
penalty
which
here
appeareth
due
upon
the
bond
tis
very
true
o
wise
and
upright
judge
how
much
more
elder
art
thou
than
thy
looks
therefore
lay
bare
your
bosom
ay
his
breast
so
says
the
bond
doth
it
not
noble
judge
nearest
his
heart

are
the
very
words

by
some
surgeon
shylock
on
your
charge
to
stop
his
wounds
lest
he
do
bleed
to
death

so
nominated
in
the
bond

is
not
so
expressd

kind

her
use
to
let
the
wretched
man
outlive
his
wealth
to
view
with
hollow
eye
and
wrinkled
brow
an
age
of
poverty

sweet
wind
did
gently
kiss
the
trees
and
they
did
make
no
noise
in
such
a
night
troilus
methinks
mounted
the
troyan
walls
and
sighd
his
soul
toward
the
grecian
tents
where
cressid
lay
that
night
in
such
a
night
did
thisbe
fearfully
oertrip
the
dew
and

lions
shadow
ere

a
night

with
a
willow
in
her
hand
upon
the
wild
seabanks
and
waft
her
love
to
come
again
to
carthage
in
such
a
night
medea
gatherd
the
enchanted
herbs
that
did
renew
old
son
in
such
a
night
did
jessica
steal
from
the
wealthy
jew
and
with
an
unthrift
love
did
run
from
venice
as
far
as
belmont
in
such
a
night
did
young
lorenzo
swear
he
lovd
her
well
stealing
her
soul
with
many
vows
of
faith
and
neer
a
true
one
in

would
outnight

footing

the
night

stray
about
by
holy
crosses
where
she
kneels
and
prays
for
happy
wedlock
hours
who
comes
with
her
none
but
a
holy
hermit
and
her
maid

pray

some
welcome
for
the
mistress
of
the
house
sola

who
calls

did
you

lorenzo
master

leave
hollaing
man
here

where
where

his
horn
full
of
good
news
my
master
will
be
here
ere

sweet
soul
lets
in
and
there
expect
their
coming
and
yet
no
matter
why
should
we
go
in
my
friend
stephano
signify
i
pray
you
within
the
house
your
mistress
is
at
hand
and
bring
your
music
forth
into
the
air
how
sweet
the
moonlight
sleeps
upon
this
bank
here
will
we
sit
and
let
the
sounds
of
music
creep
in
our
ears
soft
stillness
and
the
night
become
the
touches
of
sweet
harmony
sit
jessica
look
how
the
floor
of
heaven
is
thick
inlaid
with
patines
of
bright
gold
theres
not
the
smallest
orb
which
thou
beholdst
but
in
his
motion
like
an
angel
sings
still
quiring
to
the
youngeyed
cherubins
such
harmony
is
in
immortal
souls
but
whilst
this
muddy
vesture
of
decay
doth
grossly
close
it
in
we
cannot
hear
it
come
ho
and
wake
diana
with
a
hymn
with
sweetest
touches
pierce
your
mistress
ear
and
draw
her
home
with
music
i
am
never
merry
when
i
hear
sweet
music
the
reason
is
your
spirits
are
attentive
for
do
but
note
a
wild
and
wanton
herd
or
race
of
youthful
and
unhandled
colts
fetching
mad
bounds
bellowing
and
neighing
loud
which
is
the
hot
condition
of
their
blood
if
they
but
hear
perchance
a
trumpet
sound
or
any
air
of
music
touch
their
ears
you
shall
perceive
them
make
a
mutual
stand
their
savage
eyes
turnd
to
a
modest
gaze
by
the
sweet
power
of
music
therefore
the
poet
did
feign
that
orpheus
drew
trees
stones
and
floods
since
nought
so
stockish
hard
and
full
of
rage
but
music
for
the
time
doth
change
his
nature
the
man
that
hath
no
music
in
himself
nor
is
not
movd
with
concord
of
sweet
sounds
is
fit
for
treasons
stratagems
and
spoils
the
motions
of
his
spirit
are
dull
as
night
and
his
affections
dark
as
erebus
let
no
such
man
be
trusted
mark
the
music
that
light
we
see
is
burning
in
my
hall
how
far
that
little
candle
throws
his
beams
so
shines
a
good
deed
in
a
naughty
world
when
the
moon
shone
we
did
not
see
the
candle
so
doth
the
greater
glory
dim
the
less
a
substitute
shines
brightly
as
a
king
until
a
king
be
by
and
then
his
state
empties
itself
as
doth
an
inland
brook
into
the
main
of
waters
music
hark
it
is
your
music
madam
of
the
house
nothing
is
good
i
see
without
respect
methinks
it
sounds
much
sweeter
than
by
day
silence
bestows
that
virtue
on
it
madam
the
crow
doth
sing
as
sweetly
as
the
lark
when
neither
is
attended
and
i
think
the
nightingale
if
she
should
sing
by
day
when
every
goose
is
cackling
would
be
thought
no
better
a
musician
than
the
wren
how
many
things
by
season
seasond
are
to
their
right
praise
and
true
perfection
peace
ho
the
moon
sleeps
with
endymion
and
would
not
be
awakd
that
is
the
voice
or
i
am
much
deceivd
of
portia
he
knows
me
as
the
blind
man
knows
the
cuckoo
by
the
bad
voice
dear
lady

antipodes

wrong
in
faith

gave
it
to
the
judges
clerk
would
he
were
gelt
that
had
it
for
my
part
since
you
do
take
it
love
so
much
at
heart
a
quarrel
ho
already
whats
the
matter
about
a
hoop
of
gold
a
paltry
ring
that
she
did
give
me
whose
poesy
was
for
all
the
world
like
cutlers
poetry
upon
a
knife
love
me
and
leave
me
not
what
talk
you
of
the
posy
or
the
value
you
swore
to
me
when
i
did
give
it
you
that
you
would
wear
it
till
your
hour
of
death
and
that
it
should
lie
with
you
in
your
grave
though
not
for
me
yet
for
your
vehement
oaths
you
should
have
been
respective
and
have
kept
it
gave
it
a
judges
clerk
no
gods
my
judge
the
clerk
will
neer
wear
hair
ons
face
that
had
it
he
will
an
if
he
live
to
be
a
man
ay
if
a
woman
live
to
be
a
man
now
by
this
hand
i
gave
it
to
a
youth
a
kind
of
boy
a
little
scrubbed
boy
no
higher
than
thyself
the
judges
clerk
a
prating
boy
that
beggd
it
as
a
fee
i
could
not
for
my
heart
deny
it
him
you
were
to
blame
i
must
be
plain
with
you
to
part
so
slightly
with
your
wifes
first
gift
a
thing
stuck
on
with
oaths
upon
your
finger
and
riveted
so
with
faith
unto
your
flesh
i
gave
my
love
a
ring
and
made
him
swear
never
to
part
with
it
and
here
he
stands
i
dare
be
sworn
for
him
he
would
not
leave
it
nor
pluck
it
from
his
finger
for
the
wealth
that
the
world
masters
now
in
faith
gratiano
you
give
your
wife
too
unkind
a
cause
of
grief
an
twere
to
me
i
should
be
mad
at
it
why
i
were
best
to
cut
my
left
hand
off
and
swear
i
lost
the
ring
defending
it
my
lord
bassanio
gave
his
ring
away
unto
the
judge
that
beggd
it
and
indeed
deservd
it
too
and
then
the
boy
his
clerk
that
took
some
pains
in
writing
he
beggd
mine
and
neither
man
nor
master
would
take
aught
but
the
two
rings
what
ring
gave
you
my
lord
not
that
i
hope
that
you
receivd
of
me
if
i
could
add
a
lie
unto
a
fault
i
would
deny
it
but
you
see
my
finger
hath
not
the
ring
upon
it
it
is
gone
even
so
void
is
your
false
heart
of
truth
by
heaven
i
will
neer
come
in
your
bed
until
i
see
the
ring
nor
i
in
yours
till
i
again
see
mine
sweet
portia
if
you
did
know
to
whom
i
gave
the
ring
if
you
did
know
for
whom
i
gave
the
ring
and
would
conceive
for
what
i
gave
the
ring
and
how
unwillingly
i
left
the
ring
when
naught
would
be
accepted
but
the
ring
you
would
abate
the
strength
of
your
displeasure
if
you
had
known
the
virtue
of
the
ring
or
half
her
worthiness
that
gave
the
ring
or
your
own
honour
to
contain
the
ring
you
would
not
then
have
parted
with
the
ring
what
man
is
there
so
much
unreasonable
if
you
had
pleasd
to
have
defended
it
with
any
terms
of
zeal
wanted
the
modesty
to
urge
the
thing
held
as
a
ceremony
nerissa
teaches
me
what
to
believe
ill
die
fort
but
some
woman
had
the
ring
no
by
my
honour
madam
by
my
soul
no
woman
had
it
but
a
civil
doctor
which
did
refuse
three
thousand
ducats
of
me
and
beggd
the
ring
the
which
i
did
deny
him
and
sufferd
him
to
go
displeasd
away
even
he
that
did
uphold
the
very
life
of
my
dear
friend
what
should
i
say
sweet
lady
i
was
enforcd
to
send
it
after
him
i
was
beset
with
shame
and
courtesy
my
honour
would
not
let
ingratitude
so
much
besmear
it
pardon
me
good
lady
for
by
these
blessed
candles
of
the
night
had
you
been
there
i
think
you
would
have
beggd
the
ring
of
me
to
give
the
worthy
doctor
let
not
that
doctor
eer
come
near
my
house
since
he
hath
got
the
jewel
that
i
lovd
and
that
which
you
did
swear
to
keep
for
me
i
will
become
as
liberal
as
you
ill
not
deny
him
anything
i
have
no
not
my
body
nor
my
husbands
bed
know
him

shall
i
am
well
sure
of
it
lie

well
advisd
how
you

me
to
mine

the
unhappy
subject
of
these
quarrels

the
hearing
of
these
many
friends
i

thee
even
by
thine

fair
eyes
wherein

love
of
a
soldier
can
suffice
that
i
love
thee
i
will
not
say
pity

tis
not
a
soldierlike
phrase
but
i
say
love
me
by
me
thine
own
true
knight
by
day
or
night
or
any
kind
of
light
with
all
his
might
for
thee
to
fight
what
a
herod
of
jewry
is
this
o
wicked
wicked
world
one
that
is
wellnigh
worn
to
pieces
with
age
to
show
himself
a
young
gallant
what
an
unweighed
behaviour
hath
this
flemish
drunkard
picked
with
the
devils
name
out
of
my
conversation
that
he
dares
in
this
manner
assay
me
why
he
hath
not
been
thrice
in
my
company
what
should
i
say
to
him
i
was
then
frugal
of
my
mirth
heaven
forgive
me
why
ill
exhibit
a
bill
in
the
parliament
for
the
putting
down
of
men
how
shall
i
be
revenged
on
him
for
revenged
i
will
be
as
sure
as
his
guts
are
made
of
puddings
mistress
page
trust
me
i
was
going
to
your
house
and
trust
me
i
was
coming
to
you
you
look
very
ill
nay
ill
neer
believe
that
i
have
to
show
to
the
contrary
faith
but
you
do
in
my
mind
well
i
do
then
yet
i
say
i
could
show
you
to
the
contrary
o
mistress
page
give
me
some
counsel
whats
the
matter
woman
o
woman
if
it
were
not
for
one
trifling
respect
i
could
come
to
such
honour
hang
the
trifle
woman
take
the
honour
what
is
it
dispense
with
trifles
what
is
it
if
i
would
but
go
to
hell
for
an
eternal
moment
or
so
i
could
be
knighted
what
thou
liest
sir
alice
ford
these
knights
will
hack
and
so
thou
shouldst
not
alter
the
article
of
thy
gentry
we
burn
daylight
here
read
read
perceive
how
i
might
be
knighted
i
shall
think
the
worse
of
fat
men
as
long
as
i
have
an
eye
to
make
difference
of
mens
liking
and
yet
he
would
not
swear
praised
womens
modesty
and
gave
such
orderly
and
wellbehaved
reproof
to
all
uncomeliness
that
i
would
have
sworn
his
disposition
would
have
gone
to
the
truth
of
his
words
but
they
do
no
more
adhere
and
keep
place
together
than
the
hundredth
psalm
to
the
tune
of
green
sleeves
what
tempest
i
trow
threw
this
whale
with
so
many
tuns
of
oil
in
his
belly
ashore
at
windsor
how
shall
i
be
revenged
on
him
i
think
the
best
way
were
to
entertain
him
with
hope
till
the
wicked
fire
of
lust
have
melted
him
in
his
own
grease
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
letter
for
letter
but
that
the
name
of
page
and
ford
differs
to
thy
great
comfort
in
this
mystery
of
ill
opinions
heres
the
twin
brother
of
thy
letter
but
let
thine
inherit
first
for
i
protest
mine
never
shall
i
warrant
he
hath
a
thousand
of
these
letters
writ
with
blank
space
for
different
names
sure
more
and
these
are
of
the
second
edition
he
will
print
them
out
of
doubt
for
he
cares
not
what
he
puts
into
the
press
when
he
would
put
us
two
i
had
rather
be
a
grantess
and
lie
under
mount
pelion
well
i
will
find
you
twenty
lascivious
turtles
ere
one
chaste
man
why
this
is
the
very
same
the
very
hand
the
very
words
what
doth
he
think
of
us
nay
i
know
not
it
makes
me
almost
ready
to
wrangle
with
mine
own
honesty
ill
entertain
myself
like
one
that
i
am
not
acquainted
withal
for
sure
unless
he
know
some
strain
in
me
that
i
know
not
myself
he
would
never
have
boarded
me
in
this
fury
boarding
call
you
it
ill
be
sure
to
keep
him
above
deck
so
will
i
if
he
come
under
my
hatches
ill
never
to
sea
again
lets
be
revenged
on
him
lets
appoint
him
a
meeting
give
him
a
show
of
comfort
in
his
suit
and
lead
him
on
with
a
finebaited
delay
till
he
hath
pawned
his
horses
to
mine
host
of
the
garter
nay
i
will
consent
to
act
any
villany
against
him
that
may
not
sully
the
chariness
of
our
honesty
o
that
my
husband
saw
this
letter
it
would
give
eternal
food
to
his
jealousy
why
look
where
he
comes
and
my
good
man
too
hes
as
far
from
jealousy
as
i
am
from
giving
him
cause
and
that
i
hope
is
an
unmeasurable
distance
you
are
the
happier
woman

consult
together

you
have
been
a
man
long
known
to
me
though
i
had
never
so
good
means
as
desire
to
make
myself
acquainted
with
you
i
shall
discover
a
thing
to
you
wherein
i
must
very
much
lay
open
mine
own
imperfection
but
good
sir
john
as
you
have
one
eye
upon
my
follies
as
you
hear
them
unfolded
turn
another
into
the
register
of
your
own
that
i
may
pass
with
a
reproof
the
easier
sith
you
yourself
know
how
easy
it
is
to
be
such
an
offender
very
well
sir
proceed
there
is
a
gentlewoman
in
this
town
her
husbands
name
is
ford
well
sir
i
have
long
loved
her
and
i
protest
to
you
bestowed
much
on
her
followed
her
with
a
doting
observance
engrossed
opportunities
to
meet
her
feed
every
slight
occasion
that
could
but
niggardly
give
me
sight
of
her
not
only
bought
many
presents
to
give
her
but
have
given
largely
to
many
to
know
what
she
would
have
given
briefly
i
have
pursued
her
as
love
hath
pursued
me
which
hath
been
on
the
wing
of
all
occasions
but
whatsoever
i
have
merited
either
in
my
mind
or
in
my
means
meed
i
am
sure
i
have
received
none
unless
experience
be
a
jewel
that
i
have
purchased
at
an
infinite
rate
and
that
hath
taught
me
to
say
this
love
like
a
shadow
flies
when
substance
love
pursues
pursuing
that
that
flies
and
flying
what
pursues
have
you
received
no
promise
of
satisfaction
at
her
hands
never
have
you
importuned
her
to
such
a
purpose
never
of
what
quality
was
your
love
then
like
a
fair
house
built
upon
another
mans
ground
so
that
i
have
lost
my
edifice
by
mistaking
the
place
where
i
erected
it
to
what
purpose
have
you
unfolded
this
to
me
when
i
have
told
you
that
i
have
told
you
all
some
say
that
though
she
appear
honest
to
me
yet
in
other
places
she
enlargeth
her
mirth
so
far
that
there
is
shrewd
construction
made
of
her
now
sir
john
here
is
the
heart
of
my
purpose
you
are
a
gentleman
of
excellent
breeding
admirable
discourse
of
great
admittance
authentic
in
your
place
and
person
generally
allowed
for
your
many
warlike
courtlike
and
learned
preparations
o
sir
believe
it
for
you
know
it
there
is
money
spend
it
spend
it
spend
more
spend
all
i
have
only
give
me
so
much
of
your
time
in
exchange
of
it
as
to
lay
an
amiable
siege
to
the
honesty
of
this
fords
wife
use
your
art
of
wooing
win
her
to
consent
to
you
if
any
man
may
you
may
as
soon
as
any
would
it
apply
well
to
the
vehemency
of
your
affection
that
i
should
win
what
you
would
enjoy
methinks
you
prescribe
to
yourself
very
preposterously
o
understand
my
drift
she
dwells
so
securely
on
the
excellency
of
her
honour
that
the
folly
of
my
soul
dares
not
present
itself
she
is
too
bright
to
be
looked
against
now
could
i
come
to
her
with
any
detection
in
my
hand
my
desires
had
instance
and
argument
to
commend
themselves
i
could
drive
her
then
from
the
ward
of
her
purity
her
reputation
her
marriage
vow
and
a
thousand
other
her
defences
which
now
are
tootoo
strongly
embattled
against
me
what
say
you
tot
sir
john
master
brook
i
will
first
make
bold
with
your
money
next
give
me
your
hand
and
last
as
i
am
a
gentleman
you
shall
if
you
will
enjoy
fords
wife
o
good
sir
i
say
you
shall
want
no
money
sir
john
you
shall
want
none
want
no

in

carrion
mistress

his
throwing
into

you
may
know
by

of
alacrity
in

as
deep

should
down

had
been
drowned
but
that
the
shore
was
shelvy
and
shallow

no
master

but
the
peaking
cornuto
her
husband
master
brook
dwelling
in
a
continual
larum
of
jealousy
comes
me
in
the
instant
of
our
encounter
after
we
had
embraced
kissed
protested
and
as
it
were
spoke
the
prologue
of
our
comedy
and
at
his
heels
a
rabble
of
his
companions
thither
provoked
and
instigated
by
his
distemper
and
forsooth
to
search
his
house
for
his
wifes
love
what
while
you
were
there
while
i
was
there
and
did
he
search
for
you
and
could
not
find
you
you
shall
hear
as
good
luck
would
have
it
comes
in
one
mistress
page
gives
intelligence
of
fords
approach
and
in
her
invention
and
fords
wifes
distraction
they
conveyed
me
into
a
buckbasket
a
buckbasket
by
the
lord
a
buckbasket
rammed
me
in
with
foul
shirts
and
smocks
socks
foul
stockings
greasy
napkins
that
master
brook
there
was
the
rankest
compound
of
villanous
smell
that
ever
offended
nostril
and
how
long
lay
you
there
nay
you
shall
hear
master
brook
what
i
have
suffered
to
bring
this
woman
to
evil
for
your
good
being
thus
crammed
in
the
basket
a
couple
of
fords
knaves
his
hinds
were
called
forth
by
their
mistress
to
carry
me
in
the
name
of
foul
clothes
to
datchetlane
they
took
me
on
their
shoulders
met
the
jealous
knave
their
master
in
the
door
who
asked
them
once
or
twice
what
they
had
in
their
basket
i
quaked
for
fear
lest
the
lunatic
knave
would
have
searched
it
but
fate
ordaining
he
should
be
a
cuckold
held
his
hand
well
on
went
he
for
a
search
and
away
went
i
for
foul
clothes
but
mark
the
sequel
master
brook
i
suffered
the
pangs
of
three
several
deaths
first
an
intolerablefright
to
be
detected
with
a
jealous
rotten
bellwether
next
to
be
compassed
like
a
good
bilbo
in
the
circumference
of
a
peck
hilt
to
point
heel
to
head
and
then
to
be
stopped
in
like
a
strong
distillation
with
stinking
clothes
that
fretted
in
their
own
grease
think
of
that
a
man
of
my
kidney
think
of
that
that
am
as
subject
to
heat
as
butter
a
man
of
continual
dissolution
and
thaw
it
was
a
miracle
to
scape
suffocation
and
in
the
height
of
this
bath
when
i
was
more
than
half
stewed
in
grease
like
a
dutch
dish
to
be
thrown
into
the
thames
and
cooled
glowing
hot
in
that
surge
like
a
horseshoe
think
of
that
hissing
hot
think
of
that
master
brook
in
good
sadness

sorry

sake

protests
to

another
experiment
of
his
suspicion
but
i
am
glad

be
the
ministers

the
jest
should

not
be
publicly
shamed
come
to
the
forge

at
command
i
have
turned
away
my
other
guests
they
must
come
off
ill
sauce
them

tis
one
of
the
pest
discretions
of
a
oman
as
ever
i
did
look
upon
and
did
he
send
you
both
these
letters
at
an
instant
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
pardon
me
wife
henceforth
do
what
thou
wilt
i
rather
will
suspect
the
sun
with
cold
than
thee
with
wantonness
now
doth
thy
honour
stand
in
him
that
was
of
late
an
heretic
as
firm
as
faith
tis
well
tis
well
no
more
be
not
as
extreme
in
submission
as
in
ofrence
but
let
our
plot
go
forward
let
our
wives
yet
once
again
to
make
us
public
sport
appoint
a
meeting
with
this
old
fat
fellow
where
we
may
take
him
and
disgrace
him
for
it
there
is
no
better
way
than
that
they
spoke
of
how
to
send
him
word
theyll
meet
him
in
the
park
at
midnight
fie
fie
hell
never
come
you
say
he
has
been
thrown
into
the
rivers
and
has
been
grievously
peaten
as
an
old
oman
methinks
there
should
be
terrors
in
him
that
he
should
not
come
methinks
his
flesh
is
punished
he
shall
have
no
desires
so
think
i
too
devise
but
how
youll
use
him
when
he
comes
and
let
us
two
devise
to
bring
him
thither
there
is
an
old
tale
goes
that
herne
the
hunter
sometime
a
keeper
here
in
windsor
forest
doth
all
the
wintertime
at
still
midnight
walk
round
about
an
oak
with
great
raggd
horns
and
there
he
blasts
the
tree
and
takes
the
cattle
and
makes
milchkine
yield
blood
and
shakes
a
chain
in
a
most
hideous
and
dreadful
manner
you
have
heard
of
such
a
spirit
and
well
you
know
the
superstitious
idleheaded
eld
receivd
and
did
deliver
to
our
age
this
tale
of
herne
the
hunter
for
a
truth
why
yet
there
want
not
many
that
do
fear
in
deep
of
night
to
walk
by
this
hernes
oak
but
what
of
this
marry
this
is
our
device
that
falstaff
at
that
oak
shall
meet
with
us
disguisd
like
herne
with
huge
horns
on
his
head
well
let
it
not
be
doubted
but
hell
come
and
in
this
shape
when
you
have
brought
him
thither
what
shall
be
done
with
him
what
is
your
plot
that
likewise
have
we
thought
upon
and
thus
nan
page
my
daughter
and
my
little
son

three
or
four
more

growth

sawpit
rush
at
once
with
some
diffused
song
upon
their
sight

two
in
great
amazedness
will
fly
then
let
them
all
encircle
him
about
and
fairylike
topinch
the
unclean
knight
and
ask
him
why
that
hour
of
fairy
revel
in
their
so
sacred
paths
he
dares
to
tread
in
shape
profane
and
till
he
tell
the
truth
let
the
supposed
fairies
pinch
him
sound
and
burn
him
with
their
tapers
the
truth
being
known
well
all
present
ourselves
dishorn
the
spirit
and
mock
him
home
to
windsor
the
children
must
be
practisd

sweet
nan
present
the
fairy
queen
the
purpose
why
is
here
in
which
disguise
while
other
jests
are
something
rank
on
foot
her
father
hath
commanded
her
to
slip
away
with
slender
and
with
him
at
eton
immediately
to
marry
she
hath
consented
now
sir
her
mother
even
strong
against
that
match
and
firm
for
doctor
caius
hath
appointed
that
he
shall
likewise
shuffle
her
away
while
other
sports
are
tasking
of
their
minds
and
at
the
deanery
where
a
priest
attends
straight

and
bid
her
go
she
shall
go
with
him
her
mother
hath
intended
the
better
to
denote
her
to
the
doctor

they
must
all
be
maskd
and
vizarded
that
quaint
in
green
she
shall
be
loose
enrobd
with
ribands
pendent
flaring
bout
her
head
and
when
the
doctor
spies
his
vantage
ripe
to
pinch
her
by
the
hand
and
on
that
token
the
maid
hath
given
consent
to
go
with
him

means
she
to
deceive
father
or
mother
both

good
host

begin
to
perceive
that
i
am
made
an
ass
ay
and
an
ox
too
both
the
proofs
are
extant
and
these
are
not
fairies
i
was
three
or
four
times
in
the
thought
they
were
not
fairies
and
yet
the
guiltiness
of
my
mind
the
sudden
surprise
of
my
powers
drove
the
grossness
of
the
foppery
into
a
received
belief
in
despite
of
the
teeth
of
all
rime
and
reason
that
they
were
fairies
see
now
how
wit
may
be
made
a
jackalent
when

upon

employment
sir
john
falstaff

i

will
never
mistrust
my

till
thou
art
able
to
woo
her
in
good
english
have
i
laid
my
brain
in
the
sun
and
dried
it
that
it
wants
matter
to
prevent
so
gross
oerreaching
as
this
am
i
ridden
with
a
welsh
goat
too
shall
i
have
a
coxcomb

all
putter
seese
and
putter
have
i
lived
to
stand
at
the
taunt
of
one
that
makes
fritters
of
english
this
is
enough
to
be
the
decay
of
lust
and
latewalking
through
the
realm
why
sir
john
do
you
think
though
we
would
have
thrust
virtue
out
of
our
hearts
by
the
head
and
shoulders
and
have
given
ourselves
without
scruple
to
hell
that
ever
the
devil
could
have
made
you
our
delight
what
a
hodgepudding
a
bag
of
flax
a
puffed
man
old
cold
withered
and
of
intolerable
entrails
and
one
that
is
as
slanderous
as
satan

poor
as

wicked
as
his

holy
that

am
doubtful
of

of
his
odd
behaviour
for
yet
his

never
heard
a
play
you
break
into
some
merry
passion
and
so
offend
him
for
i
tell
you

drunkards
chamber
and
call
him
madam
do
him
obeisance
tell
him
from
me
as
he
will
win
my
love
he
bear
himself
with
honourable
action
such
as
he
hath
observd
in
noble
ladies
unto
their
lords
by
them
accomplished
such
duty
to
the
drunkard
let

do
with
soft
low
tongue
and
lowly
courtesy
and

ist
your
honour
will
command
wherein
your
lady
and
your
humble
wife
may
show
her
duty
and
make
known
her
love
and
then
with
kind
embracements
tempting
kisses
and
with
declining
head
into
his
bosom
bid
him
shed
tears
as
being
overjoyd
to
see
her
noble
lord
restord
to
health

for
this
seven
years

no
better

loathsome
beggar
and
if

boy
have
not
a
womans
gift
to
rain
a
shower
of
commanded
tears
an
onion

do
well
for
such
a
shift

a
napkin
being
close
conveyd

watery
eye
see

to
this
simple
peasant

chargd
in
peril
to
incur
your
former
malady
that
i
should
yet
absent
me
from
your
bed
i
hope
this
reason
stands
for
my
excuse
ay
it
stands
so
that
i
may
hardly
tarry
so
long
but
i
would
be
loath
to
fall

doctors
hold
it
very
meet
seeing
too
much
sadness
hath
congeald
your
blood
and
melancholy
is
the
nurse
of
frenzy
therefore
they
thought
it
good
you
hear
a
play
and
frame
your
mind
to
mirth
and
merriment
which
bars
a
thousand
harms
and
lengthens
life

a
commonty
a
christmas
gambold

mine
to
endure
her
loud
alarums
why
man
there

good
fellows
in
the
world
an
a
man
could
light
on
them
would
take
her
with
all
faults
and
money
enough
i
cannot

i
had
as
lief
take
her
dowry
with
this
condition
to
be
whipped
at
the
highcross
every
morning
faith
as
you
say

sudden
take
such
hold
o

till
i
found
it
to
be
true
i
never
thought
it
possible
or
likely
but
see
while
idly
i
stood
looking
on

found
the
effect
of
love
in
idleness
and
now
in
plainness
do
confess
to
thee
that
art
to
me
as
secret
and
as
dear
as

here
from
old
verona
such
wind
as
scatters
young
men
through
the
world
to
seek
their
fortunes
further
than
at
home
where
small
experience
grows
but
in
a
few
signior
hortensio
thus
it
stands
with
me
antonio
my
father
is
deceasd
and
i
have
thrust
myself
into
this
maze
haply
to
wive
and
thrive
as
best
i
may
crowns
in
my
purse
i
have
and
goods
at

to
a
shrewd
illfavourd
wife

thank
me
but
a
little
for
my
counsel
and
yet
ill
promise
thee
she
shall
be
rich
and
very
rich
but
thourt
too
much
my
friend
and
ill
not
wish
thee
to
her
signior
hortensio
twixt
such
friends
as
we
few
words
suffice
and
therefore
if
thou
know
one
rich
enough
to
be
petruchios
wife
as
wealth
is
burden
of
my
wooing
dance
be
she
as
foul
as
was
florentius
love
as
old
as
sibyl
and
as
curst
and
shrewd
as
socrates
xanthippe
or
a
worse
she
moves
me
not
or
not
removes
at
least
affections
edge
in
me
were
she
as
rough
as
are
the
swelling
adriatic
seas
i
come
to
wive
it
wealthily
in
padua
if
wealthily
then
happily
in
padua
nay
look
you
sir
he
tells
you
flatly
what
his
mind
is
why
give
him
gold
enough
and
marry
him
to
a
puppet
or
an
agletbaby
or
an
old
trot
with
neer
a
tooth
in
her
head
though
she
have
as
many
diseases
as
twoandfifty
horses
why
nothing
comes
amiss
so
money
comes
withal
petruchio
since
we
are
steppd
thus
far
in
i
will
continue
that
i
broachd
in
jest
i
can
petruchio
help
thee
to
a
wife
with
wealth
enough
and
young
and
beauteous
brought
up
as
best
becomes
a
gentlewoman
her
only
fault
and
that
is
faults
enough
is
that
she
is
intolerable
curst
and
shrewd
and
froward
so
beyond
all
measure
that
were
my
state
far
worser
than
it
is
i
would
not
wed
her
for
a
mine
of
gold
hortensio
peace
thou
knowst
not
golds
effect
tell
me
her
fathers
name
and
tis
enough
for
i
will
board
her
though
she
chide
as
loud
as
thunder
when
the
clouds
in
autumn
crack
her
father
is
baptista
minola
an
affable
and
courteous
gentleman
her
name
is
katharina
minola
renownd
in
padua
for
her
scolding
tongue
i
know
her
father
though
i
know
not
her
and
he
knew
my
deceased
father
well
i
will
not
sleep
hortensio
till
i
see
her
and
therefore
let
me
be
thus
bold
with
you
to
give
you
over
at
this
first
encounter
unless
you
will
accompany
me
thither
i
pray
you
sir
let
him
go
while
the
humour
lasts
o
my
word
an
she
knew
him
as
well
as
i
do
she
would
think
scolding
would
do
little
good
upon
him
she
may
perhaps
call
him
half
a
score
knaves
or
so
why
thats
nothing
an
he
begin
once
hell
rail
in
his
ropetricks
ill
tell
you
what
sir
an
she
stand
him
but
a
little
he
will
throw
a
figure
in
her
face
and
so
disfigure
her
with
it
that
she
shall
have
no
more
eyes
to
see
withal
than
a
cat
you
know
him
not
sir
tarry
petruchio
i
must
go
with
thee
for
in
baptistas
keep
my
treasure
is
he
hath
the
jewel
of
my
life
in
hold
his
youngest
daughter
beautiful
bianca
and
her
withholds
from
me
and
other
more
suitors
to
her
and
rivals
in
my
love
supposing
it
a
thing
impossible
for
those
defects
i
have
before
rehearsd
that
ever
katharina
will
be
wood
therefore
this
order
hath
baptista
taen
that

katharine
the
curst
have
got
a
husband

the
curst

me
grace
and
offer
me
disguisd
in
sober
robes
to
old
baptista
as
a
schoolmaster
well
seen
in
music
to
instruct
bianca
that
so
i
may
by
this
device
at
least
have
leave
and
leisure
to
make
love
to
her
and
unsuspected
court
her
by
herself
heres

consume
the
thing

feeds
their
fury
though
little
fire

extreme
gusts
will
blow
out
fire

fingering
when
with
a
most
impatient
devilish
spirit
frets

quoth
she
ill
fume
with
them
and
with
that
word
she
struck
me
on
the
head
and
through
the
instrument
my
pate
made
way
and
there
i
stood
amazed
for
a
while
as
on

pillory
looking
through
the
lute

did
call
me
rascal
fiddler
and
twangling
jack
with
twenty
such
vile
terms

had
studied
to
misuse
me

an
old
italian
fox

kind
my
boy
a
vengeance
on

facd
it
with
a
card
of
ten
tis
in
my
head
to
do
my

good
i
see
no
reason
but
supposd
lucentio
must
get
a
father
called
supposd
vincentio
and
thats
a
wonder
fathers
commonly
do
get
their
children

a
child
shall
get
a
sire

you
withal

wrangling
pedant
this
is
the
patroness
of
heavenly
harmony
then
give
me
leave
to
have
prerogative
and
when
in
music
we
have
spent
an
hour
your
lecture
shall
have
leisure
for
as
much
preposterous
ass
that
never
read
so
far
to
know
the
cause
why
music
was
ordaind
was
it
not
to
refresh
the
mind
of
man
after
his
studies
or
his
usual
pain
then
give
me
leave
to
read
philosophy
and
while
i
pause
serve
in
your
harmony
sirrah
i
will
not
bear
these
braves
of
thine
why
gentlemen

me
double
wrong

hipped
with
an
old
mothy
saddle
and
stirrups
of
no

besides
possessed
with

in
the
chine
troubled
with
the
lampass
infected
with
the

full
of

gartered
with

an

the
humour
of
forty
fancies
pricked
int

a
monster
a
very
monster
in

and
not
like
a
christian
footboy
or

to
your

to

festival
and

what
occasion
of
import
hath
all
so
long
detaind

were
to

and
harsh
to
hear
sufficeth
i
am
come
to
keep
my
word
though
in
some
part
enforced
to
digress
which
at
more
leisure
i
will
so
excuse
as
you
shall
well
be
satisfied
withal
but
where
is
kate
i
stay
too
long
from

not
your

unreverent
robes

to
my
chamber

her
but
thus
i
trust
you

not
marry
her
good
sooth
even
thus
therefore
ha
done
with
words
to
me
shes
married
not
unto
my
clothes
could
i
repair
what
she
will
wear
in
me
as
i
can
change
these
poor
accoutrements
twere
well
for

for
myself
but
what
a
fool
am
i
to
chat
with
you
when
i
should
bid
good
morrow
to
my
bride
and
seal
the
title
with
a
lovely
kiss
he
hath
some
meaning
in
his
mad
attire
we
will
persuade
him
be
it
possible
to
put
on
better
ere
he
go
to
church
ill
after
him
and
see
the
event
of
this
but
to
her
love
concerneth
us
to
add
her
fathers
liking
which
to
bring
to
pass
as
i
before
imparted
to
your
worship
i
am
to
get
a
man
whateer
he
be
it
skills

he
shall
be
vincentio
of

and
make
assurance
here
in

and

so
loud
that

the
book
and
as
he
stoopd
again
to
take
it
up
the
madbraind

a
cuff
that

trembled
and
shook
for

swore
as
if
the
vicar
meant
to
cozen
him
but
after
many
ceremonies
done
he
calls
for
wine

health
quoth
he
as
if
he
had
been
aboard
carousing
to
his
mates
after
a
storm
quaffd
off
the
muscadel
and
threw
the
sops
all
in
the
sextons
face
having
no
other
reason
but
that
his
beard
grew
thin
and
hungerly
and
seemd
to
ask
him
sops
as
he
was
drinking
this
done
he
took
the
bride
about
the
neck
and
kissd
her
lips
with
such
a
clamorous
smack
that
at
the
parting
all
the
church
did
echo
and

thy
bridal
chamber
peter
didst
ever
see
the
like
he
kills
her
in
her
own
humour
where
is
he
in
her
chamber
making
a
sermon
of
continency
to
her
and
rails
and
swears
and
rates
that
she
poor
soul
knows
not
which
way
to
stand
to
look
to
speak
and
sits
as
one
newrisen
from
a
dream
away
away
for
he
is
coming
hither
thus
have
i
politicly
begun
my
reign
and
tis
my
hope
to
end
successfully
my
falcon
now
is
sharp
and
passing
empty
and
till
she
stoop
she
must
not
be
fullgorgd
for
then
she
never
looks
upon
her
lure
another
way
i
have
to
man
my
haggard
to
make
her
come
and
know
her
keepers
call
that
is
to
watch
her
as
we
watch
these
kites
that
bate
and
beat
and
will
not
be
obedient
she
eat
no
meat
today
nor
none
shall
eat
last
night
she
slept
not
nor
tonight
she
shall
not
as
with
the
meat
some
undeserved
fault
ill
find
about
the
making
of
the
bed
and
here
ill
fling
the
pillow
there
the
bolster
this
way
the
coverlet
another
way
the
sheets
ay
and
amid
this
hurly
i
intend
that
all
is
done
in
reverend
care
of
her
and
in
conclusion
she
shall
watch
all
night
and
if
she
chance
to
nod
ill
rail
and
brawl
and
with
the
clamour
keep
her
still
awake
this
is
a
way
to
kill
a
wife
with
kindness
and
thus
ill
curb
her
mad
and
headstrong
humour
he
that
knows
better
how
to
tame
a
shrew
now
let
him
speak

wonderful
mistake

i
am
not
licio

a
musician
as
i
seem
to
be
but
one
that
scorns
to
live
in
this
disguise
for
such
a
one
as
leaves
a
gentleman
and
makes
a
god
of
such
a
cullion

of
her
lightness

more
but
i
do
forswear
her
as
one
unworthy
all
the
former
favours
that
i
have
fondly
flatterd
her
withal
and
here
i
take
the
like
unfeigned
oath
never
to
marry
with
her
though
she
would
entreat
fie
on
her
see
how
beastly
she
doth
court
him
would
all
the
world
but
he
had
quite
forsworn
for
me
that
i
may
surely
keep
mine
oath
i
will
be
married
to
a
wealthy
widow
ere
three
days
pass
which
hath
as
long
lovd
me

so
farewell

grace
as

your
froward
wives
as
prisoners
to
her
womanly
persuasion
katharine
that
cap
of
yours
becomes
you
not
off
with
that
bauble
throw
it
under
foot
lord
let
me
never
have
a
cause
to
sigh
till
i
be
brought
to
such
a
silly
pass
fie
what
a
foolish
duty
call
you
this
i
would
your
duty
were
as
foolish
too
the
wisdom
of
your
duty
fair
bianca
hath
cost
me
an
hundred
crowns
since
suppertime
the
more
fool
you
for
laying
on
my
duty
katharine
i
charge
thee
tell
these
headstrong
women
what
duty
they
do
owe
their
lords
and
husbands
come
come
youre
mocking
we
will
have
no
telling
come
on
i
say
and
first
begin
with
her
she
shall
not
i
say
she
shall
and
first
begin
with
her
fie
fie
unknit
that
threatening
unkind
brow
and
dart
not
scornful
glances
from
those
eyes
to
wound
thy
lord
thy
king
thy
governor
it
blots
thy
beauty
as
frosts
do
bite
the
meads
confounds
thy
fame
as
whirlwinds
shake
fair
buds
and
in
no
sense
is
meet
or
amiable
a
woman
movd
is
like
a
fountain
troubled
muddy
illseeming
thick
bereft
of
beauty
and
while
it
is
so
none
so
dry
or
thirsty
will
deign
to
sip
or
touch
one
drop
of
it
thy
husband
is
thy
lord
thy
life
thy
keeper
thy
head
thy
sovereign
one
that
cares
for
thee
and
for
thy
maintenance
commits
his
body
to
painful
labour
both
by
sea
and
land
to
watch
the
night
in
storms
the
day
in
cold
whilst
thou
liest
warm
at
home
secure
and
safe
and
craves
no
other
tribute
at
thy
hands
but
love
fair
looks
and
true
obedience
too
little
payment
for
so
great
a
debt
such
duty
as
the
subject
owes
the
prince
even
such
a
woman
oweth
to
her
husband
and
when
shes
froward
peevish
sullen
sour
and
not
obedient
to
his
honest
will
what
is
she
but
a
foul
contending
rebel
and
graceless
traitor
to
her
loving
lord
i
am
ashamd
that
women
are
so
simple
to
offer
war
where
they
should
kneel
for
peace
or
seek
for
rule
supremacy
and
sway
when
they
are
bound
to
serve
love
and
obey
why
are
our
bodies
soft
and
weak
and
smooth
unapt
to
toil
and
trouble
in
the
world
but
that
our
soft
conditions
and
our
hearts
should
well
agree
with
our
external
parts
come
come
you
froward
and
unable
worms
my
mind
hath
been
as
big
as
one
of
yours
my
heart
as
great
my
reason
haply
more
to
bandy
word
for
word
and
frown
for
frown
but
now
i
see
our
lances
are
but
straws
our
strength
as
weak
our
weakness
past
compare
that
seeming
to
be
most
which
we
indeed
least
are
then
vail
your
stomachs
for
it
is
no
boot
and
place
your
hands
below
your
husbands
foot
in
token
of
which
duty
if
he
please
my
hand
is
ready
may
it
do
him
ease
why
theres
a
wench
come
on
and
kiss
me
kate
well
go
thy
ways
old
lad
for
thou
shalt
hat
tis
a
good
hearing
when

a
harsh
hearing
when
women
are
froward
come
kate
well
to

we
three
are
married
but
you
two
are
sped

that
the
sea
mounting
to
th
welkins
cheek
dashes
the
fire
out
o
i
have
sufferd
with
those
that
i
saw
suffer
a
brave
vessel
who
had
no
doubt
some
noble
creatures
in
her
dashd
all
to
pieces
o
the
cry
did
knock
against

heart
poor
souls
they
perishd
had
i
been
any
god
of
power
i
would
have
sunk
the
sea
within
the
earth
or
eer
it
should
the
good
ship
so
have
swallowd
and
the
fraughting
souls
within
her
be
collected
no
more
amazement
tell
your
piteous
heart
theres
no
harm
done
o
woe
the
day
no
harm
i
have
done
nothing
but
in
care
of
thee
of
thee
my
dear
one
thee
my
daughter
who
art
ignorant
of
what
thou
art
nought
knowing
of
whence
i
am
nor
that
i
am
more
better
than
prospero
master
of
a
full
poor
cell
and
thy
no
greater
father
more
to
know
did
never
meddle
with
my
thoughts
tis
time
i
should
inform
thee
further
lend
thy
hand
and
pluck
my
magic
garment
from
me
so
lie
there
my
art
wipe
thou
thine
eyes
have
comfort
the
direful
spectacle
of
the
wrack
which
touchd
the
very
virtue
of
compassion
in
thee
i
have
with
such
provision
in
mine
art
so
safely
orderd
that
there
is
no
soul
no
not
so
much
perdition
as
an
hair
betid
to
any
creature
in
the
vessel
which
thou
heardst
cry
which
thou
sawst
sink
sit
down
for
thou
must
now
know
further
you
have
often
begun
to
tell
me
what
i
am
but
stoppd
and
left
me
to
a
bootless
inquisition
concluding
stay
not
yet
the
hours
now
come
the
very
minute
bids
thee
ope
thine
ear
obey
and
be
attentive
canst
thou
remember
a
time
before
we
came
unto
this
cell
i
do
not
think
thou
canst
for
then
thou
wast
not
out
three
years
old
certainly
sir
i
can
by
what
by
any
other
house
or
person
of
anything
the
image
tell
me
that
hath
kept
with
thy
remembrance
tis
far
off
and
rather
like
a
dream
than
an
assurance
that
my
remembrance
warrants
had
i
not
four
or
five
women
once
that
tended
me
thou
hadst
and
more
miranda
but
how
is
it
that
this
lives
in
thy
mind
what
seest
thou
else
in
the
dark
backward
and
abysm
of
time
if
thou
rememberst
aught
ere
thou
camst
here
how
thou
camst
here
thou
mayst
but
that
i
do
not
twelve
year
since
miranda
twelve
year
since
thy
father
was
the
duke
of
milan
and
a
prince
of
power
sir
are
not
you
my
father
thy
mother
was
a
piece
of
virtue
and
she
said
thou
wast
my
daughter
and
thy
father
was
duke
of
milan
and
his
only
heir
a
princess
no
worse
issued
o
the
heavens
what
foul
play
had
we
that
we
came
from
thence
or
blessed
wast
we
did
both
both
my
girl
by
foul
play
as
thou
sayst
were
we
heavd
thence
but
blessedly
holp
hither
o
my
heart
bleeds
to

from
my
remembrance
please
you
further
my
brother
and
thy
uncle
calld
antonio
i
pray
thee
mark
me
that
a
brother
should
be
so
perfidious
he
whom
next
thyself
of
all
the
world
i
lovd
and
to
him
put
the
manage
of
my
state
as
at
that
time
through
all
the
signiories
it
was
the
first
and
prospero
the
prime
duke
being
so
reputed
in
dignity
and
for
the
liberal
arts
without
a
parallel
those
being
all
my
study
the
government
i
cast
upon
my
brother
and
to
my
state
grew
stranger
being
transported
and
rapt
in
secret
studies
thy
false
uncle
dost
thou
attend
me
sir
most
heedfully
being
once
perfected
how
to
grant
suits
how
to
deny
them
who
tadvance
and
who
to
trash
for
overtopping
new
created
the
creatures
that
were
mine
i
say
or
changd
em
or
else
new
formd
em
having
both
the
key
of
officer
and
office
set
all
hearts
i
the
state
to
what
tune
pleasd
his
ear
that
now
he
was
the
ivy
which
had
hid
my
princely
trunk
and
suckd
my
verdure
out
ont
thou
attendst
not
o
good
sir
i
do
i
pray
thee
mark
me
i
thus
neglecting
worldly
ends
all
dedicated
to
closeness
and
the
bettering
of
my
mind
with
that
which
but
by
being
so
retird
oerprizd
all
popular
rate
in
my
false
brother
awakd
an
evil
nature
and
my
trust
like
a
good
parent
did
beget
of
him
a
falsehood
in
its
contrary
as
great
as
my
trust
was
which
had
indeed
no
limit
a
confidence
sans
bound
he
being
thus
lorded
not
only
with
what
my
revenue
yielded
but
what
my
power
might
else
exact
like
one
who
having
into
truth
by
telling
of
it
made
such
a
sinner
of
his
memory
to
credit
his
own
lie
he
did
believe
he
was
indeed
the
duke
out
o
the
substitution
and
executing
th
outward
face
of
royalty
with
all
prerogative
hence
his
ambition
growing
dost
thou
hear
your
tale
sir
would
cure
deafness
to
have
no
screen
between
this
part
he
playd
and
him
he
playd
it
for
he
needs
will
be
absolute
milan
me
poor
man
my
library
was
dukedom
large
enough
of
temporal
royalties
he
thinks
me
now
incapable
confederates
so
dry
he
was
for
sway
wi
the
king
of
naples
to
give
him
annual
tribute
do
him
homage
subject
his
coronet
to
his
crown
and
bend
the
dukedom
yet
unbowd
alas
poor
milan
to
most
ignoble
stooping
o
the
heavens
mark
his
condition
and
the
event
then
tell
me
if
this
might
be
a
brother
i
should
sin
to
think
but
nobly
of
my
grandmother
good
wombs
have
borne
bad
sons
now
the
condition
this
king
of
naples
being
an
enemy
to
me
inveterate
hearkens
my
brothers
suit
which
was
that
he
in
lieu
o
the
premises
of
homage
and
i
know
not
how
much
tribute
should
presently
extirpate
me
and
mine
out
of
the
dukedom
and
confer
fair
milan
with
all
the
honours
on
my
brother
whereon
a
treacherous
army
levied
one
midnight
fated
to
the
purpose
did
antonio
open
the
gates
of
milan
and
i
the
dead
of
darkness
the
ministers
for
the
purpose
hurried
thence
me
and
thy
crying
self
alack
for
pity
i
not
remembring
how
i
cried
out
then
will
cry
it
oer
again
it
is
a
hint
that
wrings
mine
eyes
to
t
hear
a
little
further
and
then
ill
bring
thee
to
the
present
business
which
nows
upon
us
without
the
which
this
story
were
most
impertinent
wherefore
did
they
not
that
hour
destroy
us
well
demanded
wench
my
tale
provokes
that
question
dear
they
durst
not
so
dear
the
love
my
people
bore
me
nor
set
a
mark
so
bloody
on
the
business
but
with
colours
fairer
painted
their
foul
ends
in
few
they
hurried
us
aboard
a
bark
bore
us
some
leagues
to
sea
where
they
prepard
a
rotten
carcass
of
a
boat
not
riggd
nor
tackle
sail
nor
mast
the
very
rats
instinctively
have
quit
it
there
they
hoist
us
to
cry
to
the
sea
that
roard
to
us
to
sigh
to
the
winds
whose
pity
sighing
back
again
did
us
but
loving
wrong
alack
what
trouble
was
i
then
to
you
o
a
cherubin
thou
wast
that
did
preserve
me
thou
didst
smile
infused
with
a
fortitude
from
heaven
when
i
have
deckd
the
sea
with
drops
full
salt
under
my
burden
groand
which
raisd
in
me
an
undergoing
stomach
to
bear
up
against
what
should
ensue
how
came
we
ashore
by
providence
divine
some
food
we
had
and
some
fresh
water
that
a
noble
neapolitan
gonzalo
out
of
his
charity
who
being
then
appointed
master
of
this
design
did
give
us
with
rich
garments
linens
stuffs
and
necessaries
which
since
have
steaded
much
so
of
his
gentleness
knowing
i
lovd
my
books

furnishd
me
from
mine

library
with
volumes

so
firm
so
constant

a
fever
of

mad
and
playd
some
tricks
of
desperation
all
but
mariners
plunged
in
the
foaming
brine
and
quit

sad
knot

grand
hests
she
did
confine
thee
by

of
her
more
potent
ministers

in
her
most
unmitigable
rage
into
a
cloven
pine
within

rift
imprisond
thou
didst
painfully
remain
a
dozen
years
within
which
space
she
died
and

i
might
call

a
thing
divine
for
nothing

i

as
my
soul

a
word
good

ungently
this
is
the
third
man

this
island
as
a
spy
to
win
it
from
me
the
lord
ont
no
as
i
am
a
man
theres
nothing
ill
can

entertainment
till

too
rash
a
trial
of

thy
sword
up
traitor

a
show
but
darst
not
strike
thy
conscience

so
possessd
with
guilt
come
from
thy
ward
for
i
can
here
disarm
thee
with
this
stick
and
make
thy
weapon
drop
beseech
you
father
hence
hang
not
on
my
garments
sir
have
pity
ill
be
his
surety
silence
one
word
more
shall
make
me
chide
thee
if
not
hate
thee
what
an
advocate
for
an
impostor
hush
thou
thinkst
there
is
no
more
such
shapes
as
he
having
seen
but
him
and
caliban
foolish
wench
to
the
most
of
men
this
is
a
caliban
and
they
to
him
are
angels
my
affections
are
then
most
humble
i
have
no
ambition
to
see
a
goodlier
man
come
on
obey
thy
nerves
are
in
their
infancy
again
and
have
no
vigour
in
them
so
they
are
my
spirits
as
in
a
dream
are
all
bound
up
my
fathers
loss
the
weakness
which
i
feel
the
wrack
of
all
my
friends
or
this
mans
threats
to
whom
i
am
subdued
are
but
light
to
me
might
i
but
through
my
prison
once
a
day
behold
this
maid
all
corners
else
o
th
earth
let
liberty
make
use
of
space
enough
have
i
in
such
a
prison
come
on
thou
hast
done
well
fine
ariel
follow
me
hark
what
thou
else
shalt
do
me
be
of
comfort
my
fathers
of
a
better
nature
sir
than
he
appears
by
speech
this
is
unwonted
which
now
came
from
him
thou
shalt
be
as
free
as
mountain
winds
but
then
exactly
do
all
points
of
my
command
to
the
syllable
come
follow
speak
not
for
him
beseech
you
sir
be
merry
you
have
cause
so
have
we
all
of
joy
for
our
escape
is
much
beyond
our
loss
our
hint
of
woe
is
common
every
day
some
sailors
wife
the
masters
of
some
merchant
and
the
merchant
have
just
our
theme
of
woe
but
for
the
miracle
i
mean
our
preservation
few
in
millions
can
speak
like
us
then
wisely
good
sir
weigh
our
sorrow
with
our
comfort
prithee
peace
he
receives
comfort
like
cold
porridge
the
visitor
will
not
give
him
oer
so
look
hes
winding
up
the
watch
of
his
wit
by
and
by
it
will
strike
sir
one
tell
when
every
grief
is
entertaind
thats
offerd
comes
to
the
entertainer
a
dollar
dolour
comes
to
him
indeed
you
have
spoken
truer
than
you
purposed
you
have
taken
it
wiselier
than
i
meant
you
should
therefore
my
lord
fie
what
a
spendthrift
is
he
of
his
tongue
i
prithee
spare
well
i
have
done
but
yet
he
will
be
talking
which
of
he
or
adrian
for
a
good
wager
first
begins
to
crow
the
old
cock
the
cockerel
done
the
wager
a
laughter
a
match
though
this
island
seem
to
be
desert
ha
ha
ha
so
youre
paid
uninhabitable
and
almost
inaccessible
yet
yet
he
could
not
miss
it
it
must
needs
be
of
subtle
tender
and
delicate
temperance
temperance
was
a
delicate
wench
ay
and
a
subtle
as
he
most
learnedly
delivered
the
air
breathes
upon
us
here
most
sweetly
as
if
it
had
lungs
and
rotten
ones
or
as
twere
perfumed
by
a
fen
here
is
everything
advantageous
to
life
true
save
means
to
live
of
that
theres
none
or
little
how
lush
and
lusty
the
grass
looks
how
green
the
ground
indeed
is
tawny
with
an
eye
of
green
int
he
misses
not
much
no
he
doth
but
mistake
the
truth
totally
but
the
rarity
of
it
is
which
is
indeed
almost
beyond
credit
as
many
vouchd
rarities
are
that
our
garments
being
as
they
were
drenched
in
the
sea
hold
notwithstanding
their
freshness
and
glosses
being
rather
newdyed
than
staind
with
salt
water
if
but
one
of
his
pockets
could
speak
would
it
not
say
he
lies
ay
or
very
falsely
pocket
up
his
report
methinks
our
garments
are
now
as
fresh
as
when
we
put
them
on
first
in
afric
at
the
marriage
of
the
kings
fair
daughter
claribel
to
the
king
of
tunis
twas
a
sweet
marriage
and
we
prosper
well
in
our
return
tunis
was
never
graced
before
with
such
a
paragon
to
their
queen
not
since
widow
didos
time
widow
a
pox
o
that
how
came
that
widow
in
widow
dido
what
if
he
had
said
widower
neas
too
good
lord
how
you
take
it
widow
dido
said
you
you
make
me
study
of
that
she
was
of
carthage
not
of
tunis
this
tunis
sir
was
carthage
carthage
i
assure
you
carthage
his
word
is
more
than
the
miraculous
harp
he
hath
raisd
the
wall
and
houses
too
what
impossible
matter
will
he
make
easy
next
i
think
he
will
carry
this
island
home
in
his
pocket
and
give
it
his
son
for
an
apple
and
sowing
the
kernels
of
it
in
the
sea
bring
forth
more
islands
ay
why
in
good
time
sir
we
were
talking
that
our
garments
seem
now
as
fresh
as
when
we
were
at
tunis
at
the
marriage
of
your
daughter
who
is
now
queen
and
the
rarest
that
eer
came
there
bate
i
beseech
you
widow
dido
o
widow
dido
ay
widow
dido
is
not
sir
my
doublet
as
fresh
as
the
first
day
i
wore
it
i
mean
in
a
sort
that
sort
was
well
fishd
for
when
i
wore
it
at
your
daughters
marriage
you
cram
these
words
into
mine
ears
against
the
stomach
of
my
sense
would
i
had
never
married
my
daughter
there
for
coming
thence
my
son
is
lost
and
in
my
rate
she
too
who
is
so
far
from
italy
removd
i
neer
again
shall
see
her
o
thou
mine
heir
of
naples
and
of
milan
what
strange
fish
hath
made
his
meal
on
thee
sir
he
may
live
i
saw
him
beat
the
surges
under
him
and
ride
upon
their
backs
he
trod
the
water
whose
enmity
he
flung
aside
and
breasted
the
surge
most
swoln
that
met
him
his
bold
head
bove
the
contentious
waves
he
kept
and
oard
himself
with
his
good
arms
in
lusty
stroke
to
the
shore
that
oer
his
waveworn
basis
bowd
as
stooping
to
relieve
him
i
not
doubt
he
came
alive
to
land
no
no
hes
gone
sir
you
may
thank
yourself
for
this
great
loss
that
would
not
bless
our
europe
with
your
daughter
but
rather
lose
her
to
an
african
where
she
at
least
is
banishd
from
your
eye
who
hath
cause
to
wet
the
grief
ont
prithee
peace
you
were
kneeld
to
and
importund
otherwise
by
all
of
us
and
the
fair
soul
herself
weighd
between
loathness
and
obedience
at
which
end
o
the
beam
should
bow
we
have
lost
your
son
i
fear
for
ever
milan
and
naples
have
more
widows
in
them
of
this
business
making
than
we
bring
men
to
comfort
them
the
faults
your
own
so
is
the
dearest
of
the
loss
my
lord
sebastian
the
truth
you
speak
doth
lack
some
gentleness
and
time
to
speak
it
in
you
rub
the
sore
when
you
should
bring
the
plaster
very
well
and

would
by

and
nimble
lungs
that
they
always
use
to

laughd
at

of
merry
fooling

nothing
to
you

what
a
blow

you

gentlemen
of
brave
mettle

lift
the
moon
out
of

sphere
if

continue
in

five
weeks
without
changing
we
would
so
and
then
go
abatfowling
nay
good
my
lord
be
not
angry
no
i
warrant
you
i
will
not
adventure
my
discretion
so
weakly
will
you
laugh

asleep
for
i
am
very
heavy
go
sleep
and
hear
us
what
all
so
soon
asleep
i
wish
mine
eyes
would
with
themselves
shut
up
my
thoughts
i
find
they
are
inclind
to
do
so
please
you
sir
do
not
omit
the
heavy
offer
of
it
it
seldom
visits
sorrow
when
it
doth
it
is
a
comforter
we
two
my
lord
will
guard
your
person
while
you
take
your
rest
and
watch
your
safety
thank
you
wondrous
heavy
what
a
strange
drowsiness
possesses
them
it
is
the
quality
o
the
climate
why
doth
it
not
then
our
eyelids
sink
i
find
not
myself
disposd
to
sleep
nor
i
my
spirits
are
nimble
they
fell
together
all
as
by
consent
they
droppd
as
by
a
thunderstroke
what
might
worthy
sebastian
o
what
might
no
more
and
yet
methinks
i
see
it
in
thy
face
what
thou
shouldst
be
the
occasion
speaks
thee
and
my
strong
imagination
sees
a
crown
dropping
upon
thy
head
what
art
thou
waking
do
you
not
hear
me
speak
i
do
and
surely
it
is
a
sleepy
language
and
thou
speakst
out
of
thy
sleep
what
is
it
thou
didst
say
this
is
a
strange
repose
to
be
asleep
with
eyes
wide
open
standing
speaking
moving
and
yet
so
fast
asleep
noble
sebastian
thou
letst
thy
fortune
sleep
die
rather
winkst
whiles
thou
art
waking
thou
dost
snore
distinctly
theres
meaning
in
thy
snores
i
am
more
serious
than
my
custom
you
must
be
so
too
if
heed
me
which
to
do
trebles
thee
oer
well
i
am
standing
water
ill
teach
you
how
to
flow
do
so
to
ebb
hereditary
sloth
instructs
me
o
if
you
but
knew
how
you
the
purpose
cherish
whiles
thus
you
mock
it
how
in
stripping
it
you
more
invest
it
ebbing
men
indeed
most
often
do
so
near
the
bottom
run
by
their
own
fear
or
sloth
prithee
say
on
the
setting
of
thine
eye
and
cheek
proclaim
a
matter
from
thee
and
a
birth
indeed
which
throes
thee
much
to
yield
thus
sir
although
this
lord
of
weak
remembrance
this
who
shall
be
of
as
little
memory
when
he
is
earthd
hath
here
almost
persuaded
for
hes
a
spirit
of
persuasion
only
professes
to
persuade
the
king
his
sons
alive
tis
as
impossible
that
hes
undrownd
as
he
that
sleeps
here
swims
i
have
no
hope
that
hes
undrownd
o
out
of
that
no
hope
what
great
hope
have
you
no
hope
that
way
is
another
way
so
high
a
hope
that
even
ambition
cannot
pierce
a
wink
beyond
but
doubts
discovery
there
will
you
grant
with
me
that
ferdinand

ten
leagues
beyond

that
from

we
all
were
seaswallowd

some
cast
again

by
that
destiny
to
perform
an
act
whereof
whats
past

ends
this
my

quickens
whats
dead
and
makes
my
labours

o
she
is
ten
times
more
gentle
than
her
fathers
crabbed
and
hes
composd
of
harshness
i
must
remove
some
thousands
of
these
logs
and
pile
them
up
upon
a
sore
injunction
my
sweet
mistress
weeps
when
she
sees
me
work
and
says
such
baseness
had
never
like
executor
i
forget
but
these
sweet
thoughts
do
even
refresh
my
labours
most
busiest
when
i
do
it
alas
now
pray
you
work
not
so
hard
i
would
the
lightning
had
burnt
up
those
logs
that
you
are
enjoind
to
pile
pray
set
it
down
and
rest
you
when
this
burns
twill
weep
for
having
wearied
you
my
father
is
hard
at
study
pray
now
rest
yourself
hes
safe
for
these
three
hours
o
most
dear
mistress
the
sun
will
set
before
i
shall
discharge
what
i
must
strive
to
do
if
youll
sit
down
ill
bear
your
logs
the
while
pray
give
me
that
ill
carry
it
to
the
pile
no
precious
creature
i
had
rather
crack
my
sinews
break
my
back
than
you
should
such
dishonour
undergo
while
i
sit
lazy
by
it
would
become
me
as
well
as
it
does
you
and
i
should
do
it
with
much
more
ease
for
my
good
will
is
to
it
and
yours
it
is
against
poor
worm
thou
art
infected
this
visitation
shows
it
you
look
wearily
no
noble
mistress
tis
fresh
morning
with
me
when
you
are
by
at
night
i
do
beseech
you
chiefly
that
i
might
set
it
in
my
prayers
what
is
your
name
miranda
o
my
father
i
have
broke
your
hest
to
say
so
admird
miranda
indeed
the
top
of
admiration
worth
whats
dearest
to
the
world
full
many
a
lady
i
have
eyd
with
best
regard
and
many
a
time
the
harmony
of
their
tongues
hath
into
bondage
brought
my
too
diligent
ear
for
several
virtues
have
i
likd
several
women
never
any
with
so
full
soul
but
some
defect
in
her
did
quarrel
with
the
noblest
grace
she
owd
and
put
it
to
the
foil
but
you
o
you
so
perfect
and
so
peerless
are
created
of
every
creatures
best
i
do
not
know
one
of
my
sex
no
womans
face
remember
save
from
my
glass
mine
own
nor
have
i
seen
more
that
i
may
call
men
than
you
good
friend
and
my
dear
father
how
features
are
abroad
i
am
skillless
of
but
by
my
modesty
the
jewel
in
my
dower
i
would
not
wish
any
companion
in
the
world
but
you
nor
can
imagination
form
a
shape
besides
yourself
to
like
of
but
i
prattle
something
too
wildly
and
my
fathers
precepts
i
therein
do
forget
i
am
in
my
condition
a
prince
miranda
i
do
think
a
king
i
would
not
so
and
would
no
more
endure
this
wooden
slavery
than
to

instant
that

which
breeds
between

wherefore
weep
you
at
mine
unworthiness
that
dare
not
offer
what
i
desire
to
give
and
much
less
take
what
i
shall
die
to
want
but
this
is
trifling
and

utensils
for
so
he
calls
them
which
when
he
has
a
house

withal
and
that
most
deeply
to

the
beauty
of

a
thousand
twangling
instruments
will
hum
about
mine
ears
and
sometime
voices
that
if
i
then
had
wakd
after
long
sleep
will
make
mesleep
again
and
then
in
dreaming
the
clouds
methought
would
open
and
show
riches
ready
to
drop
upon
me
that
when
i
wakd
i
cried
to
dream
again
this
will
prove
a
brave
kingdom

my
music

is
destroyed

shall
be
by

the
dulling
of
my
spirits
sit
down
and
rest
even
here
i
will
put
off
my
hope
and
keep
it
no
longer
for
my
flatterer
he
is
drownd
whom
thus
we
stray
to
find
and
the
sea
mocks
our
frustrate
search
on
land
well
let
him
go
i
am
right
glad
that
hes
so
out
of
hope
do
not
for
one
repulse
forego
the
purpose
that
you
resolvd
to
effect
the
next
advantage
will
we
take
throughly
let
it
be
tonight
for
now
they
are
oppressd
with
travel
they
will
not
nor
cannot
use
such
vigilance
as
when
they
are
fresh
i
say
tonight
no
more
what
harmony
is
this
my
good
friends
hark
marvellous
sweet
music
give
us
kind
keepers
heavens
what
were
these
a
living
drollery
now
i
will
believe
that
there
are
unicorns
that
in
arabia
there
is
one
tree
the
ph
nix
throne
one
ph
nix
at
this
hour
reigning
there
ill
believe
both
and
what
does
else
want
credit
come
to
me
and
ill
be
sworn
tis
true
travellers
neer
did
lie
though
fools
at
home
condemn
them
if
in
naples
i
should
report
this
now
would
they
believe
me
if
i
should
say
i
saw
such
islanders
for
certes
these
are
people
of
the
island
who
though
they
are
of
monstrous
shape
yet
note
their
manners
are
more
gentlekind
than
of
our
human
generation
you
shall
find
many
nay
almost
any
honest
lord
thou
hast
said
well
for
some
of
you
there
present
are
worse
than
devils
i
cannot
too
much
muse
such
shapes
such
gesture
and
such
sound
expressing
although
they
want
the
use
of
tongue
a
kind
of
excellent
dumb
discourse
praise
in
departing
they
vanishd
strangely
no
matter
since
they
have
left
their
viands
behind
for
we
have
stomachs
willt
please
you
to
taste
of
what
is
here
not
i
faith
sir
you
need
not
fear
when
we
were
boys
who
would
believe
that
there
were
mountaineers
dewlappd
like
bulls
whose
throats
had
hanging
at
them
wallets
of
flesh
or
that
there
were
such
men
whose
heads
stood
in
their
breasts
which
now
we
find
each
putterout
of
five
for
one
will
bring
us
good
warrant
of
i
will
stand
to
and
feed
although
my
last
no
matter
since
i
feel
the
best
is
past
brother
my
lord
the
duke
stand
to
and
do
as
we
you
are
three
men
of
sin
whom
destiny
that
hath
to
instrument
this
lower
world
and
what
is
int
the
neversurfeited
sea
hath
caused
to
belch
up
you
and
on
this
island
where
man
doth
not
inhabit
you
mongst
men
being
most
unfit
to
live
i
have
made
you
mad
and
even
with
suchlike
valour
men
hang
and
drown
their
proper
selves
you
fools
i
and
my
fellows
are
ministers
of
fate
the
elements
of
whom
your
swords
are
temperd
may
as
well
wound
the
loud
winds
or
with
bemockdat
stabs
kill
the
stillclosing
waters
as
diminish
one
dowle
thats
in
my
plume
my
fellowministers
are
like
invulnerable
if
you
could
hurt
your
swords
are
now
too
massy
for
your
strengths
and
will
not
be
uplifted
but
remember
for
thats
my
business
to
you
that
you
three
from
milan
did
supplant
good
prospero
exposd
unto
the
sea
which
hath
requit
it
him
and
his
innocent
child
for
which
foul
deed
the
powers
delaying
not
forgetting
have
incensd
the
seas
and
shores
yea
all
the
creatures
against
your
peace
thee
of
thy
son
alonso
they
have
bereft
and
do
pronounce
by
me
lingering
perdition
worse
than
any
death
can
be
at
once
shall
step
by
step
attend
you
and
your
ways
whose
wraths
to
guard
you
from
which
here
in
this
most
desolate
isle
else
falls
upon
your
heads
is
nothing
but
heartsorrow
and
a
clear
life
ensuing
bravely
the
figure
of
this
harpy
hast
thou
performd
my
ariel
a
grace
it
had
devouring
of
my
instruction
hast
thou
nothing
bated
in
what
thou
hadst
to
say
so
with
good
life
and
observation
strange
my
meaner
ministers
their
several
kinds
have
done
my
high
charms
work
and
these
mine
enemies
are
all
knit
up
in
their
distractions
they
now
are
in
my
power
and
in
these
fits
i
leave
them
while
i
visit
young
ferdinand
whom
they
suppose
is
drownd
and
his
and
mine
lovd
darling
i
the
name
of
something
holy
sir
why
stand
you
in
this
strange
stare
o
it
is
monstrous
monstrous
methought
the
billows
spoke
and
told
me
of
it
the
winds
did
sing
it
to
me
and
the
thunder
that
deep
and
dreadful
organpipe
pronouncd
the
name
of
prosper
it
did
bass
my
trespass
therefore
my
son
i
th
ooze
is
bedded
and
ill
seek
him
deeper
than
eer
plummet
sounded
and
with
him
there
lie
mudded
but
one
fiend
at
a
time
ill
fight
their
legions
oer
ill
be
thy
second
all
three
of
them
are
desperate
their
great
guilt
like
poison
given
to
work
a
great
time
after
now
gins
to
bite
the
spirits
i
do
beseech
you
that
are
of
suppler
joints
follow
them
swiftly
and
hinder
them
from
what
this
ecstasy
may
now
provoke
them
to
follow
i
pray
you
if
i
have
too
austerely
punishd
you
your
compensation
makes
amends
for
i
have
given
you
here
a
third
of
mine
own
life
or
that
for
which
i
live
whom
once
again
i
tender
to
thy
hand
all
thy
vexations
were
but
my
trials
of
thy
love
and
thou
hast
strangely
stood
the
test
here
afore
heaven
i
ratify
this
my
rich
gift
o
ferdinand
do
not
smile
at
me
that
i
boast
her
off
for
thou
shalt
find
she
will
outstrip
all
praise
and
make
it
halt
behind
her
i
do
believe
it
against
an
oracle
then
as
my
gift
and
thine
own
acquisition
worthily
purchasd
take
my
daughter
but
if
thou
dost
break
her
virgin
knot
before
all
sanctimonious
ceremonies
may
with
full
and
holy
rite
be
ministerd
no
sweet
aspersion
shall
the
heavens
let
fall
to
make
this
contract
grow
but
barren
hate
soureyd
disdain
and
discord
shall
bestrew
the
union
of
your
bed
with
weeds
so
loathly
that
you
shall
hate
it
both
therefore
take
heed
as
hymens
lamps
shall
light
you
as
i
hope
for
quiet
days
fair
issue
and
long
life
with
such
love
as
tis
now
the
murkiest
den
the
most
opportune
place
the
strongst
sug
gestion
our
worser
genius
can
shall
never
melt
mine
honour
into
lust
to
take
away
the
edge
of
that
days
celebration
when
i
shall
think
or
ph
bus
steeds
are
founderd
or
night
kept
chaind
below
fairly
spoke
sit
then
and
talk
with
her
she
is
thine
own
what
ariell
my
industrious
servant
ariell
what
would
my
potent
master
here
i
am
thou
and
thy
meaner
fellows
your
last
service
did
worthily
perform
and
i
must
use
you
in
such
another
trick
go
bring
the
rabble
oer
whom
i
give
thee
power
here
to
this
place
incite
them
to
quick
motion
for
i
must
bestow
upon
the
eyes
of
this
young
couple
some
vanity
of
mine
art
it
is
my
promise
and
they
expect
it
from
me
presently
ay
with
a
twink
before
you
can

come
and
go
and
breathe
twice
and

the
solemn
temples
the

smote
the

in
their

beat
the
ground
for
kissing
of
their
feet
yet
always
bending
towards
their
project
then
i
beat
my
tabor
at

like
unbackd
colts
they
prickd
their
ears
advancd
their
eyelids
lifted
up
their
noses
as

followd
through
toothd

sharp
furzes
pricking

budge
till
your
release
the
king
his

yours
abide
all
three
distracted
and
the
remainder
mourning
over
them
brimful
of
sorrow
and
dismay
but
chiefly
him
that
you
termd
sir
the
good
old
lord
gonzalo
his
tears
run
down
his
beard
like
winters
drops
from
eaves
of

strongly
works
them
that
if
you

your
affections
would
become
tender
dost
thou

so
spirit
mine
would
sir
were

shall
hast
thou
which

a
touch
a
feeling
of
their
afflictions

not
myself
one
of
their

that
relish
all
as
sharply
passion
as
they
be
kindlier
movd
than
thou
art

with
their
high
wrongs
i

struck
to
the
quick
yet
with
my
nobler
reason
gainst
my
fury

the
rarer
action

in
virtue
than
in

i
here
could
pluck
his
highness
frown
upon
you
and
justify
you
traitors
at
this
time
i
will
tell
no
tales
the
devil
speaks
in
him
no
for
you
most
wicked
sir
whom
to
call
brother
would
even
infect
my
mouth
i
do
forgive
thy
rankest
fault
all
of
them
and
require
my
dukedom
of
thee
which
perforce
i
know
thou
must
restore
if
thou
beest
prospero
give
us
particulars
of
thy
preservation
how
thou
hast
met
us
here
who
three
hours
since
were
wrackd
upon
this
shore
where
i
have
lost
how
sharp
the
point
of
this
remembrance
is
my
dear
son
ferdinand
i
am
woe
fort
sir
irreparable
is
the
loss
and
patience
says
it
is
past
her
cure
i
rather
think
you
have
not
sought
her
help
of
whose
soft
grace
for
the
like
loss
i
have
her
sovereign
aid
and
rest
myself
content
you
the
like
loss
as
great
to
me
as
late
and
supportable

have
lost
my
daughter

mudded
in
that
oozy
bed
where
my
son
lies
when
did
you
lose
your
daughter
in
this
last
tempest
i
perceive
these
lords
at
this
encounter

so
much
admire
that
they
devour
their
reason
and
scarce
think
their
eyes
do
offices
of
truth
their
words
are
natural
breath
but
howsoeer
you
have
been
justled
from
your
senses

for
certain
that

am
prospero
and

very
duke

shore
where
you
were
wrackd
was
landed
to
be
the
lord
ont

more
yet

become
kings
of

joy
and
set

down
with
gold
on
lasting
pillars
in
one
voyage

claribel
her
husband
find
at
tunis
and
ferdinand
her
brother
found
a
wife
where
he
himself
was

oerboard
not
an
oath
on

but
three
glasses
since
we
gave

i
did
think

and
several
noises
of
roaring
shrieking
howling
jingling
chains

shalt
be
free

is
as
strange
a
maze
as
eer
men

and
there
is
in
this
business
more
than
nature
was
ever
conduct
of
some
oracle

strangeness
of
this

to
you

away
the
story
of

particular
accidents
gone
by

not
since
i
have
my
dukedom
got
and
pardond
the
deceiver
dwell
in
this
bare
island
by
your
spell
but
release
me
from
my
bands
with
the
help
of
your
good
hands
gentle
breath
of
yours
my
sails
must
fill
or
else
my
project
fails
which
was
to
please
now
i
want
spirits
to
enforce
art
to
enchant
and
my
ending
is
despair
unless
i
be
relievd
by
prayer
which
pierces
so
that
it
assaults
mercy
itself
and
frees
all
faults
as
you
from
crimes
would
pardond
be
let
your
indulgence
set
me
free
the
two
gentlemen
of
verona
cease
to
persuade
my
loving
proteus
homekeeping
youth
have
ever
homely
wits
weret
not
affection
chains
thy
tender
days
to
the
sweet
glances
of
thy
honourd
love
i
rather
would
entreat
thy
company
to
see
the
wonders
of
the
world
abroad
than
living
dully
sluggardizd
at
home
wear
out
thy
youth
with
shapeless
idleness
but
since
thou
lovst
love
still
and
thrive
therein
even
as
i
would
when
i
to
love
begin
wilt
thou
be
gone
sweet
valentine
adieu
think
on
thy
proteus
when
thou
haply
seest
some
rare
noteworthy
object
in
thy
travel
wish
me
partaker
in
thy
happiness
when
thou
dost
meet
good
hap
and
in
thy
danger
if
ever
danger
do
environ
thee
commend
thy
grievance
to
my
holy
prayers
for
i
will
be
thy
beadsman
valentine
and
on
a
lovebook
pray
for
my
success
upon
some
book
i
love
ill
pray
for
thee
thats
on
some
shallow
story
of
deep
love
how
young
leander
crossd
the
hellespont
thats
a
deep
story
of
a
deeper
love
for
he
was
more
than
over
shoes
in
love
tis
true
for
you
are
over
boots
in
love
and
yet
you
never
swum
the
hellespont
over
the
boots
nay
give
me
not
the
boots
no
i
will
not
for
it
boots
thee
not
what
to
be
in
love
where
scorn
is
bought
with
groans
coy
looks
with
heartsore
sighs
one
fading
moments
mirth
with
twenty
watchful
weary
tedious
nights
if
haply
won
perhaps
a
hapless
gain
if
lost
why
then
a
grievous
labour
won
however
but
a
folly
bought
with
wit
or
else
a
wit
by
folly
vanquished
so
by
your
circumstance
you
call
me
fool
so
by
your
circumstance
i
fear
youll
prove
tis
love
you
cavil
at
i
am
not
love
love
is
your
master
for
he
masters
you
and
he
that
is
so
yoked
by
a
fool
methinks
should
not
be
chronicled
for
wise
yet
writers
say
as
in
the
sweetest
bud
the
eating
canker
dwells
so
eating
love
inhabits
in
the
finest
wits
of
all
and
writers
say
as
the
most
forward
bud
is
eaten
by
the
canker
ere
it
blow
even
so
by
love
the
young
and
tender
wit
is
turned
to
folly
blasting
in
the
bud
losing
his
verdure
even
in
the
prime
and
all
the
fair
effects
of
future
hopes
but
wherefore
waste
i
time
to
counsel
thee
that
art
a
votary
to
fond
desire
once
more
adieu
my
father
at
the
road
expects
my
coming
there
to
see
me
shippd
and
thither
will
i
bring
thee
valentine
sweet
proteus
no
now
let
us
take
our
leave
to
milan
let
me
hear
from
thee
by
letters
of
thy
success
in
love
and
what
news
else
betideth
here
in
absence
of
thy
friend
and
i
likewise
will
visit
thee
with
mine
all
happiness
bechance
to
thee
in
milan
as
much
to
you
at
home
and
so
farewell
he
after
honour
hunts
i
after
love
he
leaves
his
friends
to
dignify
them
more
i
leave
myself
my
friends
and
all
for
love
thou
julia
thou
hast
metamorphosd
me
made
me
neglect
my
studies
lose
my
time
war
with
good
counsel
set
the
world
at
nought
made
wit
with
musing
weak
heart
sick
with
thought
sir
proteus
save
you
saw
you
my
master
but
now
he
parted
hence
to
embark
for
milan
twenty
to
one
then
he
is
shippd
already
and
i
have
playd
the
sheep
in
losing
him
indeed
a
sheep
doth
very
often
stray
an
if
the
shepherd
be
a
while
away
you
conclude
that
my
master
is
a
shepherd
then
and
i
a
sheep
i
do
why
then
my
horns
are
his
horns
whether
i
wake
or
sleep
a
silly
answer
and
fitting
well
a
sheep
this
proves
me
still
a
sheep
true
and
thy
master
a
shepherd
nay
that
i
can
deny
by
a
circumstance
it
shall
go
hard
but
ill
prove
it
by
another
the
shepherd
seeks
the
sheep
and
not
the
sheep
the
shepherd
but
i
seek
my
master
and
my
master
seeks
not
me
therefore
i
am
no
sheep
the
sheep
for
fodder
follow
the
shepherd
the
shepherd
for
food
follows
not
the
sheep
thou
for
wages
followest
thy
master
thy
master
for
wages
follows
not
thee
therefore
thou
art
a
sheep
such
another
proof
will
make
me
cry
baa
but
dost
thou
hear
gavest
thou
my
letter
to
julia
ay
sir
i
a
lost
mutton
gave
your
letter
to
her
a
laced
mutton
and
she
a
laced
mutton
gave
me
a
lost
mutton
nothing
for
my
labour
heres
too
small
a
pasture
for
such
store
of
muttons
if
the
ground
be
overcharged
you
were
best
stick
her
nay
in
that
you
are
astray
twere
best
pound
you
nay
sir
less
than
a
pound
shall
serve
me
for
carrying
your
letter
you
mistake
i
mean
the
pound
a
pinfold
from
a
pound
to
a
pin
fold
it
over
and
over
tis
threefold
too
little
for
carrying
a
letter
to
your
lover
but
what
said
she
did
she
nod
ay
nod
ay
why
thats
noddy
you
mistook
sir
i
say
she
did
nod
and
you
ask
me
if
she
did
nod
and
i
say
ay
and
that
set
together
is
noddy
now
you
have
taken
the
pains
to
set
it
together
take
it
for
your
pains
no
no
you
shall
have
it
for
bearing
the
letter
well
i
perceive
i
must
be
fain
to
bear
with
you
why
sir
how
do
you
bear
with
me
marry
sir
the
letter
very
orderly
having
nothing
but
the
word
noddy

my
pains
beshrew
me
but
you
have
a
quick
wit
and
yet
it
cannot
overtake
your
slow
purse
come
come
open
the
matter
in
brief
what
said
she
open
your
purse

hard
to
me
that

i
fear
shell
prove
as
hard
to

stones
for
shes
as
hard
as

so
much

to
a
drier
death
on

some
better
messenger
i
fear
my
julia
would
not
deign
my
lines
receiving
them
from
such
a
worthless
post
but
say
lucetta
now
we
are
alone
wouldst
thou
then
counsel
me
to
fall
in
love
ay
madam
so
you
stumble
not
unheedfully
of
all
the
fair
resort
of
gentlemen
that
every
day
with
parle
encounter
me
in
thy
opinion
which
is
worthiest
love
please
you
repeat
their
names
ill
show
my
mind
according
to
my
shallow
simple
skill
what
thinkst
thou
of
the
fair
sir
eglamour
as
of
a
knight
wellspoken
neat
and
fine
but
were
i
you
he
never
should
be
mine
what
thinkst
thou
of
the
rich
mercatio
well
of
his
wealth
but
of
himself
so
so
what
thinkst
thou
of
the
gentle
proteus
lord
lord
to
see
what
folly
reigns
in
us
how
now
what
means
this
passion
at
his
name
pardon
dear
madam
tis
a
passing
shame
that
i
unworthy
body
as
i
am
should
censure
thus
on
lovely
gentlemen
why
not
on
proteus
as
of
all
the
rest
then
thus
of
many
good
i
think
him
best
your
reason
i
have
no
other
but
a
womans
reason
i
think
him
so
because
i
think
him
so
and
wouldst
thou
have
me
cast
my
love
on
him
ay
if
you
thought
your
love
not
cast
away
why
he
of
all
the
rest
hath
never
movd
me
yet
he
of
all
the
rest
i
think
best
loves
ye
his
little
speaking
shows
his
love
but
small
fire
thats
closest
kept
burns
most
of
all
they
do
not
love
that
do
not
show
their
love
o
they
love
least
that
let
men
know
their
love
i
would
i
knew
his
mind
peruse
this
paper
madam
to
julia
say
from
whom
that
the
contents
will
show
say
say
who
gave
it
thee
sir
valentines
page
and
sent
i
think
from
proteus
he
would
have
given
it
you
but
i
being
in
the
way
did
in
your
name
receive
it
pardon
the
fault
i
pray
now
by
my
modesty
a
goodly
broker
dare
you
presume
to
harbour
wanton
lines
to
whisper
and
conspire
against
my
youth
now
trust
me
tis
an
office
of
great
worth
and
you
an
officer
fit
for
the
place
there
take
the
paper
see
it
be
returnd
or
else
return
no
more
into
my
sight
to
plead
for
love
deserves
more
fee
than
hate
will
ye
be
gone
that
you
may
ruminate
and
yet
i
would
i
had
oerlookd
the
letter
it
were
a
shame
to
call
her
back
again
and
pray
her
to
a
fault
for
which
i
chid
her
what
fool
is
she
that
knows
i
am
a
maid
and
would
not
force
the
letter
to
my
view
since
maids
in
modesty
say
no
to
that
which
they
would
have
the
profferer
construe
ay
fie
fie
how
wayward
is
this
foolish
love
that
like
a
testy
babe
will
scratch
the
nurse
and
presently
all
humbled
kiss
the
rod
how
churlishly
i
child
lucetta
hence
when
willingly
i
would
have
had
her
here
how
angerly
i
taught
my
brow
to
frown
when
inward
joy
enforcd
my
heart
to
smile
my
penance
is
to
call
lucetta
back
and
ask
remission
for
my
folly
past
what
ho
lucetta
what
would
your
ladyship
is
it
near
dinnertime
i
would
it
were
that
you
might
kill
your
stomach
on
your
meat
and
not
upon
your
maid
what
ist
that
you
took
up
so
gingerly
nothing
why
didst
thou
stoop
then
to
take
a
paper
up
that
i
let
fall
and
is
that
paper
nothing
nothing
concerning
me
then
let
it
lie
for
those
that
it
concerns
madam
it
will
not
lie
where
it
concerns
unless
it
have
a
false
interpreter
some
love
of
yours
hath
writ
to
you
in
rime
that
i
might
sing
it
madam
to
a
tune
give
me
a
note
your
ladyship
can
set
as
little
by
such
toys
as
may
be
possible
best
sing
it
to
the
tune
of
light
o
love
it
is
too
heavy
for
so
light
a
tune
heavy
belike
it
hath
some
burden
then
ay
and
melodious
were
it
would
you
sing
it
and
why
not
you
i
cannot
reach
so
high
lets
see
your
song
how
now
minion
keep
tune
there
still
so
you
will
sing
it
out
and
yet
methinks
i
do
not
like
this
tune
you
do
not
no
madam
it
is
too
sharp
you
minion
are
too
saucy
nay
now
you
are
too
flat
and
mar
the
concord
with
too
harsh
a
descant
there
wanteth
but
a
mean
to
fill
your
song
the
mean
is
drownd
with
your
unruly
bass
indeed
i
bid
the
base
for
proteus
this
babble
shall
not
henceforth
trouble
me
here
is
a
coil
with
protestation
go
get
you
gone
and
let
the
papers
lie

be
fingering
them
to
anger
me

makes
it
strange
but
she
would
be
best
pleasd
to
be
so
angerd
with
another
letter
nay
would
i
were
so
angerd
with
the
same
o
hateful
hands
to
tear
such
loving
words
injurious
wasps
to
feed
on
such
sweet
honey
and
kill
the
bees
that
yield
it
with
your
stings
ill
kiss
each
several

in
revenge
of
thy
ingratitude

thy
name
against
the
bruising

contemptuously
on
thy
disdain
and
here
is
writ
lovewounded

wounded

bosom
as
a
bed
shall
lodge
thee

wound

sovereign

unto
a
ragged
fearful
hanging
rock
and
throw

raging
sea

of

your
son
why
what
of
him
he
wonderd
that
your
lordship

to

his
youth
at

while
other
men
of
slender
reputation
put
forth
their
sons
to
seek
preferment
out
some
to
the
wars
to
try
their
fortune
there
some
to
discover
islands
far
away
some
to
the
studious
universities

exercises

son
was
meet
and
did
request
me
to
importune
you
to
let
him
spend
his
time
no
more
at
home
which
would
be
great
impeachment
to
his
age
in
having
known
to
travel
in
his
youth
nor
needst
thou
much
importune
me
to
that
whereon

and
with
the
vantage
of
mine
own
excuse
hath
he
excepted
most
against
my
love

this
spring
of
love
resembleth
the
uncertain
glory
of
an
april
day
which

shows
all
the
beauty
of
the
sun
and
by
and
by
a
cloud

within
hearing

your
worship
sir
or

too
forward
and
yet
i
was
last
chidden
for
being
too
slow
go
to
sir
tell
me
do
you
know
madam
silvia
she
that
your
worship
loves
why
how
know
you
that
i
am
in
love
marry
by
these
special
marks
first
you
have
learned
like
sir
proteus
to
wreathe
your
arms
like
a
malecontent
to
relish
a
lovesong
like
a
robinredbreast
to
walk
alone
like
one
that
had
the
pestilence
to
sigh
like
a
schoolboy
that
had
lost
his
a
b
c
to
weep
like
a
young
wench
that
had
buried
her
grandam
to
fast
like
one
that
takes
diet
to
watch
like
one
that
fears
robbing
to
speak
puling
like
a
beggar
at
hallowmas
you
were
wont
when
you
laughed
to
crow
like
a
cock
when
you
walked
to
walk
like
one
of
the
lions
when
you
fasted
it
was
presently
after
dinner
when
you
looked
sadly
it
was
for
want
of
money
and
now
you
are
metamorphosed
with
a
mistress
that
when
i
look
on
you
i
can
hardly
think
you
my
master
are
all
these
things
perceived
in
me
they
are
all
perceived
without
ye
without
me
they
cannot
without
you
nay
thats
certain
for
without
you
were
so
simple
none
else
would
but
you
are
so
without
these
follies
that
these
follies
are
within
you
and
shine
through
you
like
the
water
in
an
urinal
that
not
an
eye
that
sees
you
but
is
a
physician
to
comment
on
your
malady
but
tell
me
dost
thou
know
my
lady
silvia
she
that
you
gaze
on
so
as
she
sits
at
supper
hast
thou
observed
that
even
she
i
mean
why
sir
i
know
her
not
dost
thou
know
her
by
my
gazing
on
her
and
yet
knowest
her
not
is
she
not
hardfavoured
sir
not
so
fair
boy
as
wellfavoured
sir
i
know
that
well
enough
what
dost
thou
know
that
she
is
not
so
fair
as
of
you
wellfavoured
i
mean
that
her
beauty
is
exquisite
but
her
favour
infinite
thats
because
the
one
is
painted
and
the
other
out
of
all
count
how
painted
and
how
out
of
count
marry
sir
so
painted
to
make
her
fair
that
no
man
counts
of
her
beauty
how
esteemest
thou
me
i
account
of
her
beauty
you
never
saw
her
since
she
was
deformed
how
long
hath
she
been
deformed
ever
since
you
loved
her
i
have
loved
her
ever
since
i
saw
her
and
still
i
see
her
beautiful
if
you
love
her
you
cannot
see
her
why
because
love
is
blind
o
that
you
had
mine
eyes
or
your
own
eyes
had
the
lights
they
were
wont
to
have
when
you
chid
at
sir
proteus
for
going
ungartered
what
should
i
see
then
your
own
present
folly
and
her
passing
deformity
for
he
being
in
love
could
not
see
to
garter
his
hose
and
you
being
in
love
cannot
see
to
put
on
your
hose
belike
boy
then
you
are
in
love
for
last
morning
you

not
see
to
wipe
my
shoes
true
sir

was
in
love
with
my
bed
i
thank
you
you
swinged
me
for
my
love
which
makes
me
the
bolder
to
chide
you
for
yours
in
conclusion
i
stand
affected
to
her
i
would
you
were
set
so
your
affection
would
cease
last
night
she
enjoined
me
to
write
some
lines
to
one
she
loves
and
have
you
i
have
are
they
not
lamely
writ
no
boy
but
as
well
as
i
can
do
them
peace
here

comes
o
excellent
motion
o
exceeding
puppet
now
will
he
interpret
to
her
madam
and
mistress
a
thousand
good
morrows
o
give
ye
good
even
heres
a
million
of
manners
sir
valentine
and
servant
to
you

thousand

nose
on
a
mans
face
or
a
weathercock
on
a
steeple
my
master
sues
to
her
and
she
hath
taught
her
suitor
he
being
her
pupil
to
become
her
tutor
o
excellent
device
was
there

heard
a
better
that
my
master
being
scribe
to
himself
should
write
the
letter
how
now
sir
what
are
you
reasoning
with
yourself
nay
i
was
riming
tis
you
that

the
reason

what
to
be
a
spokesman
from
madam
silvia
to
whom
to
yourself
why
she
wooes
you
by
a
figure
what
figure

a
letter

hath
not
writ
to
me

hath
made
you
write
to
yourself
why
do
you
not
perceive
the
jest

believe
me
no
believing
you
indeed
sir
but
did
you
perceive
her
earnest
she
gave
me
none
except
an
angry
word
why
she
hath
given
you
a
letter
thats
the
letter
i
writ
to
her
friend
and
that
letter
hath
she
delivered
and
there
an
end
i
would
it
were
no
worse
ill
warrant
you
tis
as
well
for
often
have
you
writ
to
her
and
she
in
modesty
or
else
for
want
of
idle
time
could
not
again
reply
or
fearing
else
some
messenger
that
might
her
mind
discover
herself
hath
taught
her
love
himself
to
write
unto
her
lover

ye
don
antonio
your
countryman
ay
my
good
lord
i
know
the
gentleman
to
be
of
worth
and
worthy
estimation
and
not
without
desert
so
well
reputed
hath
he
not
a
son
ay
my
good
lord
a
son
that
well
deserves
the
honour
and
regard
of
such
a
father
you
know
him
well
i
know
him
as
myself
for
from
our
infancy
we
have
conversd
and
spent
our
hours
together
and
though
myself
have
been
an
idle
truant
omitting
the
sweet
benefit
of
time
to
clothe
mine
age
with
angellike
perfection
yet
hath
sir
proteus
for
thats
his
name
made
use
and
fair
advantage
of
his
days
his
years
but
young
but
his
experience
old
his
head
unmellowd
but
his
judgment
ripe
and
in
a
word
for
far
behind
his
worth
come
all
the
praises
that
i
now
bestow
he
is
complete
in
feature
and
in
mind
with
all
good
grace
to
grace
a
gentleman
beshrew
me
sir
but
if
he
make
this
good
he

as
worthy

an
empress

as
meet
to
be
an
emperors
counsellor

gentleman

her
crystal
looks
belike
that

she
hath
enfranchisd
them
upon
some
other
pawn
for
fealty
nay
sure
i
think
she
holds
them
prisoners
still

he
should
be
blind

being
blind
how
could
he
see
his
way
to
seek
out
you
why
lady
love
hath
twenty
pairs
of
eyes
they

that
love
hath
not
an
eye

lovers

to
weary
you

not
in
a
lovediscourse
ay
proteus
but
that
life
is
alterd
now
i
have
done
penance
for
contemning
love
whose
high
imperious
thoughts
have
punishd
me
with
bitter
fasts
with
penitential
groans
with
nightly
tears
and
daily
heartsore
sighs
for
in
revenge
of
my
contempt
of
love
love
hath
chasd
sleep
from
my
enthralled
eyes
and
made
them
watchers
of
mine
own
hearts
sorrow
o
gentle
proteus
loves
a
mighty
lord
and
hath
so
humbled
me
as
i
confess
there
is
no
woe
to
his
correction
nor
to
his
service
no
such
joy
on
earth
now
no
discourse
except
it
be
of
love
now
can
i
break
my
fast
dine
sup
and
sleep
upon
the
very
naked
name
of
love
enough
i
read
your
fortune
in
your
eye
was
this
the
idol
that
you
worship
so
even
she
and
is
she
not
a
heavenly
saint
no
but
she
is
an
earthly
paragon
call
her
divine
i
will
not
flatter
her
o
flatter
me
for
love
delights
in
praises
when
i
was
sick
you
gave
me
bitter
pills
and
i
must
minister
the
like
to
you
then
speak
the
truth
by
her
if
not
divine
yet
let
her
be
a
principality
sovereign
to
all
the
creatures
on
the
earth
except
my
mistress
sweet
except
not
any
except
thou
wilt
except
against
my
love
have
i
not
reason
to
prefer
mine
own
and
i
will
help
thee
to
prefer
her
too
she
shall
be
dignified
with
this
high
honour
to
bear
my
ladys
train
lest
the
base
earth
should
from
her
vesture
chance
to
steal
a
kiss
and
of
so
great
a
favour
growing
proud
disdain
to
root
the
summerswelling
flower
and
make
rough
winter
everlastingly
why
valentine
what
braggardism
is
this
pardon
me
proteus
all
i
can
is
nothing
to
her
whose
worth
makes
other
worthies
nothing
she
is
alone
then
let
her
alone
not
for
the
world
why
man
she
is
mine
own
and
i
as
rich
in
having
such
a
jewel
as
twenty
seas
if
all
their
sand
were
pearl
the
water
nectar
and
the
rocks
pure
gold
forgive
me
that
i
do
not
dream
on
thee
because
thou
seest
me
dote
upon
my
love
my
foolish
rival
that
her
father
likes
only
for
his
possessions
are
so
huge
is
gone
with
her
along
and
i
must
after
for
love
thou
knowst
is
full
of
jealousy
but
she
loves
you
ay
and
we
are
betrothd
nay
more
our
marriagehour
with
all
the
cunning
manner
of
our
flight
determind
of
how
i
must
climb
her
window
the
ladder
made
of
cords
and
all
the
means
plotted
and
greed
on
for
my
happiness
good
proteus
go
with
me
to
my
chamber
in
these
affairs
to
aid
me
with
thy
counsel
go
on
before
i
shall
inquire
you
forth
i
must
unto
the
road
to
disembark
some
necessaries
that
i
needs
must
use
and
then
ill
presently
attend
you
will
you
make
haste
i
will
even
as
one
heat
another
heat
expels
or
as
one
nail
by
strength
drives
out
another
so
the
remembrance
of
my
former
love
is
by
a
newer
object
quite
forgotten
is
it
mine
eye
or
valentinus
praise
her
true
perfection
or
my
false
transgression
that
makes
me
reasonless
to
reason
thus
shes
fair
and
so
is
julia
that
i
love
that
i
did
love
for
now
my
love
is
thawd
which
like
a
waxen
image
gainst
a
fire
bears
no
impression
of
the
thing
it
was
methinks
my
zeal
to
valentine
is
cold
and
that
i
love
him
not
as
i
was
wont
o
but
i
love
his
lady
tootoo
much
and
thats
the
reason
i
love
him
so
little
how
shall
i
dote
on
her
with
more
advice
that
thus
without
advice
begin
to
love
her
tis
but
her
picture
i
have
yet
beheld
and
that
hath
dazzled
my
reasons
light
but
when
i
look
on
her
perfections
there
is
no
reason
but
i
shall
be
blind
if
i
can
check
my
erring
love
i
will
if
not
to
compass
her
ill
use
my
skill
launce
by
mine
honesty
welcome
to
milan
forswear
not
thyself
sweet
youth
for
i
am
not
welcome
i
reckon
this
always
that
a
man
is
never
undone
till
he
be
hanged
nor
never
welcome
to
a
place
till
some
certain
shot
be
paid
and
the
hostess
say
welcome
come
on
you
madcap
ill
to
the
alehouse
with
you
presently
where
for
one
shot
of
five
pence
thou
shalt
have
five
thousand
welcomes
but
sirrah
how
did
thy
master
part
with
madam
julia
marry
after
they
closed
in
earnest
they
parted
very
fairly
in
jest
but
shall
she
marry
him
no
how
then
shall
he
marry
her
no
neither
what
are
they
broken
no
they
are
both
as
whole
as
a
fish
why
then
how
stands
the
matter
with
them
marry
thus
when
it
stands
well
with
him
it
stands
well
with
her
what
an
ass
art
thou
i
understand
thee
not
what
a
block
art
thou
that
thou
canst
not
my
staff
understands
me
what
thou
sayest
ay
and
what
i
do
too
look
thee
ill
but
lean
and
my
staff
understands
me
it
stands
under
thee
indeed
why
standunder
and
understand
is
all
one
but
tell
me
true
willt
be
a
match
ask
my
dog
if
he
say
ay
it
will
if
he
say
no
it
will
if
he
shake
his
tail
and
say
nothing
it
will
the
conclusion
is
then
that
it
will
thou
shalt
never
get
such
a
secret
from
me
but
by
a
parable
tis
well
that
i
get
it
so
but
launce
how
sayest
thou
that
my
master
is
become
a
notable
lover
i
never
knew
him
otherwise
than
how
a
notable
lubber
as
thou
reportest
him
to
be
why
thou
whoreson
ass
thou
mistakest
me
why
fool
i
meant
not
thee
i
meant
thy
master
i
tell
thee
my
master
is
become
a
hot
lover
why
i
tell
thee
i
care
not
though
he
burn
himself
in
love
if
thou
wilt
go
with
me
to
the
alehouse
so
if
not
thou
art
a
hebrew
a
jew
and
not
worth
the
name
of
a
christian
why
because
thou
hast
not
so
much
charity
in
thee
as
to
go
to
the
ale
with
a
christian
wilt
thou
go
at
thy
service
to
leave
my
julia
shall
i
be
forsworn
to
love
fair
silvia
shall
i
be
forsworn
to
wrong
my
friend
i
shall
be
much
forsworn
and
even
that
power
which
gave
me
first
my
oath
provokes
me
to
this
threefold
perjury
love
bade
me
swear
and
love
bids
me
forswear
o
sweetsuggesting
love
if
thou
hast
sinnd
teach
me
thy
tempted
subject
to
excuse
it
at
first
i
did
adore
a
twinkling
star
but
now
i
worship
a
celestial
sun
unheedful
vows
may
heedfully
be
broken
and
he
wants
wit
that
wants
resolved
will
to
learn
his
wit
to
exchange
the
bad
for
better
fie
fie
unreverend
tongue
to
call
her
bad
whose
sovereignty
so
oft
thou
hast
preferrd
with
twenty
thousand
soulconfirming
oaths
i
cannot
leave
to
love
and
yet
i
do
but
there
i
leave
to
love
where
i
should
love
julia
i
lose
and
valentine
i
lose
if
i
keep
them
i
needs
must
lose
myself
if
i
lose
them
thus
find
i
by
their
loss
for
valentine
myself
for
julia
silvia
i
to
myself
am
dearer
than
a
friend
for
love
is
still
most
precious
in
itself
and
silvia
witness
heaven
that
made
her
fair
shows
julia
but
a
swarthy
ethiope
i
will
forget
that
julia
is
alive
remembering
that
my
love
to
her
is
dead
and
valentine
ill
hold
an
enemy
aiming
at
silvia
as
a
sweeter
friend
i
cannot
now
prove
constant
to
myself
without
some
treachery
usd
to
valentine
this
night
he
meaneth
with
a
corded
ladder
to
climb
celestial
silvias
chamberwindow
myself
in
counsel
his
competitor
now
presently
ill
give
her
father
notice
of
their
disguising
and
pretended
flight
who
all
enragd
will
banish
valentine
for
thurio
he
intends
shall
wed
his
daughter
but
valentine
being
gone
ill
quickly
cross
by
some
sly
trick
blunt
thurios
dull
proceeding
love
lend
me
wings
to
make
my
purpose
swift
as
thou
hast
lent
me
wit
to
plot
this
drift
counsel
lucetta
gentle
girl
assist
me
and
een
in
kind
love
i
do
conjure
thee
who
art
the
table
wherein
all
my
thoughts
are
visibly
characterd
and
engravd
to
lesson
me
and
tell
me
some
good
mean
how
with
my
honour
i
may
undertake
a
journey
to
my
loving
proteus
alas
the
way
is
wearisome
and
long
a
truedevoted
pilgrim
is
not
weary
to
measure
kingdoms
with
his
feeble
steps
much
less
shall
she
that
hath
loves
wings
to
fly
and
when
the
flight
is
made
to
one
so
dear
of
such
divine
perfection
as
sir
proteus
better
forbear
till
proteus
make
return
o
knowst
thou
not
his
looks
are
my
souls
food
pity
the
dearth
that
i
have
pined
in
by
longing
for
that
food
so
long
a
time
didst
thou
but
know
the
inly
touch
of
love
thou
wouldst
as
soon
go
kindle
fire
with
snow
as
seek
to
quench
the
fire
of
love
with
words
i
do
not
seek
to
quench
your
loves
hot
fire
but
qualify
the
fires
extreme
rage
lest
it
should
burn
above
the
bounds
of
reason
the
more
thou
dammst
it
up
the
more
it
burns
the
current
that
with
gentle
murmur
glides
thou
knowst
being
stoppd
impatiently
doth
rage
but
when
his
fair
course
is
not
hindered
he
makes
sweet
music
with
th
enamelld
stones
giving
a
gentle
kiss
to
every
sedge
he
overtaketh
in
his
pilgrimage
and
so
by
many
winding
nooks
he
strays
with
willing
sport
to
the
wild
ocean
then
let
me
go
and
hinder
not
my
course
ill
be
as
patient
as
a
gentle
stream
and
make
a
pastime
of
each
weary
step
till
the
last
step
have
brought
me
to
my
love
and
there
ill
rest
as
after
much
turmoil
a
blessed
soul
doth
in
elysium
but
in
what
habit
will
you
go
along
not
like
a
woman
for
i
would
prevent
the
loose
encounters
of
lascivious
men
gentle
lucetta
fit
me
with
such
weeds
as
may
beseem
some
wellreputed
page
why
then
your
ladyship
must
cut
your
hair
no
girl
ill
knit
it
up
in
silken
strings
with
twenty
oddconceited
truelove
knots
to
be
fantastic

become
a
youth
of
greater
time
than
i
shall
show
to
be
what

make
your
breeches
that
fits
as
well
as

me
good
my
lord

why
even
what
fashion

needs
have
them
with
a
codpiece
madam
out
out
lucetta
that

a

a
codpiece
to
stick
pins
on
lucetta
as
thou
lovst
me
let
me
have
what
thou
thinkst
meet
and
is
most
mannerly
but
tell
me
wench
how
will
the
world
repute
me
for
undertaking
so
unstaid
a
journey
i
fear
me
it
will
make
me
scandalizd
if
you
think
so
then
stay
at
home
and
go
not
nay
that
i
will
not
then
never
dream
on
infamy
but
go
if
proteus
like
your
journey
when
you
come
no
matter
whos
displeasd
when
you
are
gone
i
fear
me
he
will
scarce
be
pleasd
withal
that
is
the
least
lucetta
of
my
fear
a
thousand
oaths
an
ocean
of
his
tears
and
instances
of
infinite
of
love
warrant
me
welcome
to
my
proteus
all
these
are
servants
to
deceitful
men
base
men
that
use
them
to
so
base
effect
but
truer
stars
did
govern
proteus
birth
his
words
are
bonds
his
oaths
are
oracles
his
love
sincere
his
thoughts
immaculate
his
tears
pure
messengers
sent
from
his
heart
his
heart
as
far
from
fraud
as
heaven
from
earth
pray
heaven
he
prove
so
when
you
come
to
him
now
as
thou
lovst
me
do
him
not
that
wrong
to
bear
a
hard
opinion
of
his
truth
only
deserve
my
love
by
loving
him
and
presently
go
with
me
to
my
chamber
to
take
a
note
of
what
i
stand
in
need
of
to
furnish
me
upon
my
longing
journey
all
that
is
mine
i
leave
at
thy

reputation
only
in

but
to
it
presently
i
am
impatient

we
have
some
secrets
to
confer
about
now
tell

your
will
with
me
my
gracious
lord
that
which
i
would
discover

law
of
friendship

me
to
conceal
but
when
i
call
to
mind
your
gracious
favours
done
to
me
undeserving
as
i
am
my
duty
pricks
me
on
to
utter
that
which
else
no
worldly
good
should
draw
from
me
know
worthy
prince
sir
valentine
my
friend
this
night
intends
to
steal
away
your
daughter

one
made
privy
to
the
plot
i
know
you
have
determind
to
bestow
her
on
thurio
whom
your
gentle
daughter
hates
and
should
she
thus
be
stoln
away
from
you
it
would
be
much
vexation
to
your
age
thus
for
my
dutys
sake
i
rather
chose
to
cross
my
friend
in
his
intended
drift
than
by
concealing
it
heap
on
your
head
a
pack
of
sorrows
which
would
press
you
down
being
unprevented
to
your
timeless
grave
proteus
i
thank
thee
for
thine
honest
care
which
to
requite
command
me
while
i
live
this
love
of
theirs
myself
have
often
seen
haply
when
they
have
judgd
me
fast
asleep
and
oftentimes
have
purposd
to
forbid
sir
valentine
her
company
and
my
court
but
fearing
lest
my
jealous
aim
might
err
and
so
unworthily
disgrace
the
man
a
rashness
that
i
ever
yet
have
shunnd
i
gave
him
gentle
looks
thereby
to
find
that
which
thyself
hast
now
disclosd
to
me
and
that
thou
mayst
perceive
my
fear
of
this
knowing
that
tender
youth
is
soon
suggested
i
nightly
lodge
her
in
an
upper
tower
the
key
whereof
myself
have
ever
kept
and
thence
she
cannot
be
conveyd
away
know
noble
lord
they
have
devisd
a
mean
how
he
her
chamberwindow
will
ascend
and
with
a
corded
ladder
fetch
her
down
for
which
the
youthful
lover
now
is
gone
and
this
way
comes
he
with
it
presently
where
if
it
please
you
you
may
intercept
him
but
good
my
lord
do
it
so
cunningly
that
my
discovery
be
not
aimed
at
for
love
of
you
not
hate
unto
my
friend
hath
made
me
publisher
of
this
pretence
upon
mine
honour
he
shall
never
know
that
i
had
any
light
from
thee
of
this
adieu
my
lord
sir
valentine
is
coming
sir
valentine
whither
away
so
fast
please
it
your
grace
there
is
a
messenger
that
stays
to
bear
my
letters
to
my
friends
and
i
am
going
to
deliver
them
be
they
of
much
import
the
tenour
of
them
doth
but
signify
my
health
and
happy
being
at
your
court
nay
then
no
matter
stay
with
me
awhile
i
am
to
break
with
thee
of
some
affairs
that
touch
me
near
wherein
thou
must
be
secret
tis
not
unknown
to
thee
that
i
have
sought
to
match
my
friend
sir
thurio
to
my
daughter
i
know
it
well
my
lord
and
sure
the
match
were
rich
and
honourable
besides
the
gentleman
is
full
of
virtue
bounty
worth
and
qualities
beseeming
such
a
wife
as
your
fair
daughter
cannot
your
grace
win
her
to
fancy
him
no
trust
me
she
is
peevish
sullen
froward
proud
disobedient
stubborn
lacking
duty
neither
regarding
that
she
is
my
child
nor
fearing
me
as
if
i
were
her
father
and
may
i
say
to
thee
this
pride
of
hers
upon
advice
hath
drawn
my
love
from
her
and
where
i
thought
the
remnant
of
mine
age
should
have
been
cherishd
by
her
childlike
duty
i
now
am
full
resolvd
to
take
a
wife
and
turn
her
out
to
who
will
take
her
in
then
let
her
beauty
be
her
weddingdower
for
me
and
my
possessions
she
esteems
not
what
would
your
grace
have
me
to
do
in
this
there
is
a
lady
of
verona
here
whom
i
affect
but
she
is
nice
and
coy
and
nought
esteems
my
aged
eloquence
now
therefore
would
i
have
thee
to
my
tutor
for
long
agone
i
have
forgot
to
court
besides
the
fashion
of
the
time
is
changd
how
and
which
way
i
may
bestow
myself
to
be
regarded
in
her
sunbright
eye
win
her
with
gifts
if
she
respect
not
words
dumb
jewels
often
in
their
silent
kind
more
than
quick
words
do
move
a
womans
mind
but
she
did
scorn
a
present
that
i
sent
her
a
woman
sometime
scorns
what
best
contents
her
send
her
another
never
give
her
oer
for
scorn
at
first
makes
afterlove
the
more
if
she
do
frown
tis
not
in
hate
of
you
but
rather
to
beget
more
love
in
you
if
she
do
chide
tis
not
to
have
you
gone
for
why
the
fools
are
mad
if
left
alone
take
no
repulse
whatever
she
doth
say
for
get
you
gone
she
doth
not
mean
away
flatter
and
praise
commend
extol
their
graces
though
neer
so
black
say
they
have
angels
faces
that
man
that
hath
a
tongue
i
say
is
no
man
if
with
his
tongue
he
cannot
win
a
woman
but
she
i
mean
is
promisd
by
her
friends
unto
a
youthful
gentleman
of
worth
and
kept
severely
from
resort
of
men
that
no
man
hath
access
by
day
to
her
why
then
i
would
resort
to
her
by
night
ay
but
the
doors
be
lockd
and
keys
kept
safe
that
no
man
hath
recourse
to
her
by
night
what
lets
but
one
may
enter
at
her
window
her
chamber
is
aloft
far
from
the
ground
and
built
so
shelving
that
one
cannot
climb
it
without
apparent
hazard
of
his
life
why
then
a
ladder
quaintly
made
of
cords
to
cast
up
with
a
pair
of
anchoring
hooks
would
serve
to
scale
another
heros
tower
so
bold
leander
would
adventure
it
now
as
thou
art
a
gentleman
of
blood
advise
me
where
i
may
have
such
a
ladder
when
would
you
use
it
pray
sir
tell
me
that
this
very
night
for
love
is
like
a
child
that
longs
for
every
thing
that
he
can
come
by
by
seven
oclock
ill
get
you
such
a
ladder
but
hark
thee
i
will
go
to
her
alone
how
shall
i
best
convey
the
ladder
thither
it
will
be
light
my
lord
that
you
may
bear
it
under
a
cloak
that
is
of
any
length
a
cloak
as
long
as
thine
will
serve
the
turn
ay
my
good
lord
then
let
me
see
thy
cloak
ill
get
me
one
of
such
another
length
why
any
cloak
will
serve
the
turn
my
lord
how
shall
i
fashion
me
to
wear
a
cloak
i
pray
thee
let
me
feel
thy
cloak
upon
me
what
letter
is
this
same
whats
here
to
silvia
and
here
an
engine
fit
for
my
proceeding
ill
be
so
bold
to
break
the
seal
for
once
my
thoughts
do
harbour
with
my
silvia
nightly
and
slaves
they
are
to
me
that
send
them
flying
o
could
their
master
come
and
go
as
lightly
himself
would
lodge
where
senseless
they

doth
silvia
know
that
i

banished
ay
ay
and
she
hath
offerd
to
the
doom
which
unreversd
stands
in
effectual
force
a
sea
of
melting
pearl
which
some
call
tears
those
at
her
fathers
churlish
feet
she
tenderd
with
them
upon
her
knees
her
humble
self
wringing
her
hands
whose
whiteness
so
became
them
as
if
but
now
they
waxed
pale
for
woe
but
neither
bended
knees
pure
hands
held
up
sad
sighs
deep
groans
nor
silvershedding
tears
could
penetrate
her
uncompassionate
sire
but
valentine
if
he
be
taen
must
die
besides
her
intercession
chafd
him
so
when
she
for
thy
repeal
was
suppliant
that
to
close
prison
he
commanded
her
with
many
bitter
threats
of
biding
there
no
more
unless
the
next
word
that
thou
speakst
have
some
malignant
power
upon
my
life
if
so
i
pray
thee
breathe
it
in
mine
ear
as
ending
anthem
of
my
endless
dolour
cease
to
lament
for
that
thou
canst
not
help
and

that

thy
staying

abridge
thy
life
hope

and
manage
it
against
despairing
thoughts
thy

many
nameless
virtues
thats
as
much
as
to
say
bastard
virtues
that

their
fathers
and
therefore
have
no
names
here
follow
her
vices
close
at
the
heels
of

virtues

northgate
for
me
for
thee
ay
who
art
thou

stayed
for
a
better
man
than
thee
and
must
i
go
to
him
thou
must
run
to
him
for
thou
hast
stayed
so
long
that
going
will
scarce
serve
the
turn
why
didst
not
tell
me
sooner
pox
of
your
loveletters
now
will
he
be
swingd
for
reading
my
letter
an
unmannerly
slave
that
will
thrust
himself
into
secrets
ill
after
to
rejoice
in
the
boys
correction
sir
thurio
fear
not
but
that
she
will
love
you
now
valentine
is
banishd
from
her
sight
since
his
exile
she
hath
despisd
me
most
forsworn
my
company
and
raild
at
me
that
i
am
desperate
of
obtaining
her
this
weak
impress
of
love
is
as
a
figure
trenched
in
ice
which
with
an
hours
heat
dissolves
to
water
and
doth
lose
his
form
a
little
time
will
melt
her
frozen
thoughts
and
worthless
valentine
shall
be
forgot
how
now
sir
proteus
is
your
countryman
according
to
our
proclamation
gone
gone
my
good
lord
my
daughter
takes
his
going
grievously
a
little
time
my
lord
will
kill
that
grief
so
i
believe
but
thurio
thinks
not
so
proteus
the
good
conceit
i
hold
of
thee
for
thou
hast
shown
some
sign
of
good
desert
makes
me
the
better
to
confer
with
thee
longer
than
i
prove
loyal
to
your
grace
let
me
not
live
to
look
upon
your
grace
thou
knowst
how
willingly
i
would
effect
the
match
between
sir
thurio
and
my
daughter
i
do
my
lord
and
also
i
think
thou
art
not
ignorant
how
she
opposes
her
against
my
will
she
did
my
lord
when
valentine
was
here
ay
and
perversely
she
persevers
so
what
might
we
do
to
make
the
girl
forget
the
love
of
valentine
and
love
sir
thurio
the
best
way
is
to
slander
valentine
with
falsehood
cowardice
and
poor
descent
three
things
that
women
highly
hold
in
hate
ay
but
shell
think
that
it
is
spoke
in
hate
ay
if
his
enemy
deliver
it
therefore
it
must
with
circumstance
be
spoken
by
one
whom
she
esteemeth
as
his
friend
then
you
must
undertake
to
slander
him
and
that
my
lord
i
shall
be
loath
to
do
tis
an
ill
office
for
a
gentleman
especially
against
his
very
friend
where
your
good
word
cannot
advantage
him
your
slander
never
can
endamage
him
therefore
the
office
is
indifferent
being
entreated
to
it
by
your
friend
you
have
prevaild
my
lord
if
i
can
do
it
by
aught
that
i
can
speak
in
his
dispraise
she
shall
not
long
continue
love
to
him
but
say
this
weed
her
love
from
valentine
it
follows
not
that
she
will
love
sir
thurio
therefore
as
you
unwind
her
love
from
him
lest
it
should
ravel
and
be
good
to
none
you
must
provide
to
bottom
it
on
me
which
must
be
done
by
praising
me
as
much
as
you
in
worth
dispraise
sir
valentine
and
proteus
we
dare
trust
you
in
this
kind
because
we
know
on
valentines
report
you
are
already
loves
firm
votary
and
cannot
soon
revolt
and
change
your
mind
upon
this
warrant
shall
you
have
access
where
you
with
silvia
may
confer
at
large
for
she
is
lumpish
heavy
melancholy
and
for
your
friends
sake
will
be
glad
of
you
where
you
may
temper
her
by
your
persuasion
to
hate
young
valentine
and
love
my
friend
as
much
as
i
can
do
i
will
effect
but
you
sir
thurio
are
not
sharp
enough
you
must
lay
lime
to
tangle
her
desires
by
wailful
sonnets
whose
composed
rimes
should
be
fullfraught
with
serviceable
vows
ay
much
is
the
force
of
heavenbred
poesy
say
that
upon
the
altar
of
her
beauty
you
sacrifice
your
tears
your
sighs
your
heart
write
till
your
ink
be
dry
and
with
your
tears
moist
it
again
and
frame
some
feeling
line
that
may
discover
such
integrity

this

and
thy
advice

in

presently
to

some

that
i
have
little
wealth
to
lose
a
man
i
am
crossd
with
adversity
my
riches
are
these
poor
habiliments
of
which
if
you

that
i

you

you
long
sojournd

some
sixteen
months

not
thwarted
me
what
were
you
banishd
thence
i
was
for
what
offence
for
that
which
now
torments
me
to
rehearse
i
killd
a
man
whose
death
i
much
repent
but
yet
i
slew
him
manfully
in
fight
without
false
vantage
or
base
treachery
why
neer
repent
it
if
it
were
done
so
but
were
you
banishd
for
so
small
a
fault
i
was
and
held
me
glad
of
such
a
doom
have
you
the
tongues
my
youthful
travel
therein
made
me
happy
or
else
i
often
had
been
miserable

kind
of
thievery
peace
villain
tell
us
this
have
you
anything
to
take
to
nothing
but
my
fortune

of
us
are
gentlemen
such
as
the
fury
of
ungovernd
youth
thrust
from
the
company
of
awful
men
myself
was
from
verona
banished
for
practising
to
steal
away
a
lady
an
heir
and
near
allied
unto
the
duke
and
i
from
mantua
for
a
gentleman
who
in
my
mood
i
stabbd
unto
the
heart
and
i
for
such
like
petty
crimes
as
these
but
to
the
purpose
for
we
cite
our
faults
that
they
may
hold
excusd
our
lawless
lives
and
partly
seeing
you
are
beautified
with
goodly
shape
and
by
your
own
report
a
linguist
and
a
man
of
such
perfection
as
we
do
in
our
quality
much
want
indeed
because
you
are
a
banishd
man
therefore
above
the
rest
we
parley
to
you
are
you
content
to
be
our
general
to
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
live
as
we
do
in
this
wilderness
what
sayst
thou
wilt
thou
be
of
our
consort
say
ay
and
be
the
captain
of
us
all
well
do
thee
homage
and
be
ruld
by
thee
love
thee
as
our
commander
and
our
king
but
if
thou
scorn
our
courtesy
thou
diest
thou
shalt
not
live
to
brag
what
we
have
offerd
i
take
your
offer
and
will
live
with
you
provided
that
you
do
no
outrages
on
silly
women
or
poor
passengers
no
we
detest
such
vile
base
practices
come
go
with
us

thee
to
our
crews
and
show

all
the
treasure

got

that

of
a
puppy
one
that
i
saved
from
drowning
when
three
or
four
of
his
blind
brothers
and
sisters
went
to
it
i
have
taught
him
even
as
one
would
say
precisely
thus
would
i
teach
a
dog
i
was
sent
to
deliver
him
as
a
present
to
mistress
silvia
from
my
master
and
i
came
no
sooner
into
the
diningchamber
but
he
steps
me
to
her
trencher
and
steals
her
capons
leg
o
tis
a
foul
thing
when
a
cur
cannot
keep
himself
in
all
companies
i
would
have
as
one
should
say
one
that
takes
upon
him
to
be
a
dog
indeed
to
be
as

were
a
dog
at
all
things
if
i
had
not
had
more
wit
than
he
to
take
a
fault
upon
me
that
he
did
i
think
verily
he
had
been
hanged
fort
sure
as
i
live
he
had
suffered
fort
you
shall
judge
he
thrusts
me
himself
into
the
company
of
three
or
four
gentlemanlike
dogs
under
the
dukes
table
he
had
not
been
there
bless
the

him
out
with
the
dog

one
what
cur

another
whip
him
out

the
third
hang
him
up
says
the
duke
i
having
been
acquainted
with
the
smell
before

was
crab
and

me
look
on
that
again
it
may
not
be
good
madam
pardon
me
there
hold
i
will
not
look
upon
your
masters
lines
i
know
they
are
stuffd
with
protestations
and
full
of
newfound
oaths
which
he
will
break
as
easily
as
i
do
tear
his
paper
madam
he
sends
your
ladyship
this
ring
the
more
shame
for
him
that
he
sends
it
me
for
i
have
heard
him
say
a
thousand
times
his
julia
gave
it
him
at
his
departure
though
his
false
finger
have
profand
the
ring
mine
shall
not
do
his
julia
so
much
wrong
she
thanks
you
what
sayst
thou
i
thank
you
madam
that
you
tender
her
poor
gentlewoman
my
master
wrongs
her
much
dost
thou
know
her
almost
as
well
as
i
do
know
myself
to
think
upon
her
woes
i
do
protest
that
i
have
wept
a
hundred
several
times
belike
she
thinks
that
proteus
hath
forsook
her
i
think
she
doth
and
thats
her
cause
of
sorrow
is
she
not
passing
fair
she
hath
been
fairer
madam
than
she
is
when
she
did
think
my
master
lovd
her
well
she
in
my
judgment
was
as
fair
as
you
but
since
she
did
neglect
her
lookingglass
and
threw
her
sunexpelling
mask
away
the
air
hath
starvd
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
and
pinchd
the
lilytincture
of
her
face
that
now
she
is
become
as
black
as
i
how
tall
was
she
about
my
stature
for
at
pentecost
when
all
our
pageants
of
delight
were
playd
our
youth
got
me
to
play
the
womans
part
and
i
was
trimmd
in
madam
julias
gown
which
served
me
as
fit
by
all
mens
judgments
as
if
the
garment
had
been
made
for
me
therefore
i
know
she
is
about
my
height
and
at
that
time
i
made
her
weep
agood
for
i
did
play
a
lamentable
part
madam
twas
ariadne
passioning
for
theseus
perjury
and
unjust
flight
which
i
so
lively
acted
with
my
tears
that
my
poor
mistress
moved
therewithal
wept
bitterly
and
would
i
might
be
dead
if
i
in
thought
felt
not
her
very
sorrow
she
is
beholding
to
thee
gentle
youth
alas
poor
lady
desolate
and
left
i
weep
myself
to
think
upon
thy
words
here
youth
there
is
my
purse
i
give
thee
this
for
thy
sweet
mistress
sake
because
thou
lovst
her
farewell
and
she
shall
thank
you
fort
if
eer
you
know
her
a
virtuous
gentlewoman
mild
and
beautiful
i
hope
my
masters
suit
will
be
but
cold
since
she
respects
my
mistress
love
so
much
alas
how
love
can
trifle
with
itself
here
is
her
picture
let
me
see
i
think
if
i
had
such
a
tire
this
face
of
mine
were
full
as
lovely
as
is
this
of
hers
and
yet
the
painter
flatterd
her
a
little
unless
i
flatter
with
myself
too
much
her
hair
is
auburn
mine
is
perfect
yellow
if
that
be
all
the
difference
in
his
love
ill
get
me
such
a
colourd
periwig
her
eyes
are
grey
as
glass
and
so
are
mine
ay
but
her
foreheads
low
and
mines
as
high
what
should
it
be
that
he
respects
in
her
but
i
can
make
respective
in
myself
if
this
fond
love
were
not
a
blinded
god
come
shadow
come
and
take
this
shadow
up
for
tis
thy
rival
o
thou
senseless
form
thou
shalt
be
worshippd
kissd
lovd
and
adord
and
were
there
sense
in
his
idolatry
my
substance
should
be
statue
in
thy
stead
ill
use
thee
kindly
for
thy
mistress
sake
that
usd
me
so
or
else
by
jove
i
vow
i
should
have
scratchd
out
your
unseeing
eyes
to
make
my
master
out
of
love
with
thee
the
sun
begins
to
gild
the
western
sky
and
now
it
is
about
the
very
hour
that
silvia
at
friar
patricks
cell
should
meet
me
she
will
not
fail
for
lovers
break
not
hours
unless
it
be
to
come
before
their
time
so
much
they
spur
their
expedition
see
where
she
comes
lady
a
happy
evening
amen
amen
go
on
good
eglamour
out
at
the
postern
by
the
abbeywall
i
fear
i
am
attended
by
some
spies
fear
not
the
forest
is
not
three
leagues
off
if
we
recover
that
were
sure
enough
sir
proteus
what
says
silvia
to
my
suit
o
sir
i
find
her
milder
than
she
was
and
yet
she
takes
exceptions
at
your
person
what
that
my
leg
is
too
long
no
that
it
is
too
little
ill
wear
a
boot
to
make
it
somewhat
rounder
but
love
will
not
be
spurrd
to
what
it
loathes
what
says
she
to
my
face
she
says
it
is
a
fair
one
nay
then
the
wanton
lies
my
face
is
black
but
pearls
are
fair
and
the
old
saying
is
black
men
are
pearls
in
beauteous
ladies
eyes
tis
true
such
pearls
as
put
out
ladies
eyes
for
i
had
rather
wink
than
look
on
them
how
likes
she
my
discourse
ill
when
you
talk
of
war
but
well
when
i
discourse
of
love
and
peace
but
better
indeed
when
you
hold
your
peace
what
says
she
to
my
valour
o
sir
she
makes
no
doubt
of
that
she
needs
not
when
she
knows
it
cowardice
what
says
she
to
my
birth
that
you
are
well
derivd
true
from
a
gentleman
to
a
fool
considers
she
my
possessions
o
ay
and
pities
them
wherefore
that
such
an
ass
should
owe
them
that
they
are
out
by
lease
here
comes
the
duke
how
now
sir
proteus
how
now
thurio
which
of
you
saw
sir
eglamour
of
late
not
i
nor
i
saw
you
my
daughter
neither
why
then
shes
fled
unto
that
peasant
valentine
and
eglamour
is
in
her
company
tis
true
for
friar
laurence
met
them
both
as
he
in
penance
wanderd
through
the
forest
him
he
knew
well
and
guessd
that
it
was
she
but
being
maskd
he
was
not
sure
of
it
besides
she
did
intend
confession
at
patricks
cell
this
even
and
there
she
was
not
these
likelihoods
confirm
her
flight
from
hence
therefore
i
pray
you
stand
not
to
discourse
but
mount
you
presently
and
meet
with
me
upon
the
rising
of
the
mountainfoot
that
leads
towards
mantua
whither
they
are
fled
dispatch
sweet
gentlemen
and
follow
me
why
this
it
is
to
be
a
peevish
girl
that
flies
her
fortune
when
it
follows
her
ill
after
more
to
be
revengd
on
eglamour
than
for
the
love
of
reckless
silvia
and
i
will
follow
more
for
silvias
love
than
hate
of
eglamour
that
goes
with
her
and
i
will
follow
more
to
cross
that
love
than
hate
for
silvia
that
is
gone
for
love
come
come
be
patient
we
must
bring
you
to
our
captain
a
thousand
more
mischances

an
honourable
mind
and
will
not
use
a
woman
lawlessly
o
valentine
this
i
endure
for
thee
how
use
doth
breed
a
habit
in
a
man
this
shadowy
desart
unfrequented
woods
i
better
brook
than
flourishing
peopled
towns
here
can
i
sit
alone
unseen
of
any
and
to
the
nightingales
complaining
notes
tune
my
distresses
and
record
my
woes
o
thou
that
dost
inhabit
in
my
breast
leave
not
the
mansion
so
long
tenantless
lest
growing
ruinous

building
fall

no
memory
of
what
it
was
repair
me
with
thy
presence
silvia
thou
gentle
nymph
cherish
thy
forlorn
swain
what
halloing
and
what
stir
is

today
these
are
my
mates
that
make
their
wills
their
law
have
some
unhappy
passenger
in
chase
they
love
me
well
yet
i
have
much
to
do
to
keep
them
from
uncivil
outrages
withdraw
thee
valentine
whos
this
comes
here
madam
this
service
i
have
done
for
you
though
you
respect
not
aught
your
servant
doth
to
hazard
life
and
rescue
you
from
him
that
would
have
forcd
your
honour
and
your
love
vouchsafe
me
for
my
meed
but

smaller
boon

and
less
than
this
i
am
sure
you
cannot
give
how
like
a
dream
is
this
i
see
and
hear
love
lend
me
patience
to
forbear
awhile
o
miserable
unhappy
that
i
am
unhappy
were
you
madam
ere
i
came
but
by
my
coming
i
have
made
you
happy
by
thy
approach
thou
makst
me
most
unhappy
and
me
when
he
approacheth
to
your
presence
had
i
been
seized
by
a
hungry
lion
i
would
have
been
a
breakfast
to
the
beast
rather
than
have
false
proteus
rescue
me
o
heaven
be
judge
how
i
love
valentine
whose
lifes
as
tender
to
me
as
my
soul
and
full
as
much
for
more
there
cannot
be
i
do
detest
false
perjurd
proteus
therefore

me
no
more
what
dangerous
action
stood
it
next
to
death
would
i
not
undergo
for
one
calm
look
o
tis
the
curse
in
love
and
still
approvd
when
women
cannot
love
where
theyre
belovd
when
proteus
cannot
love
where
hes
belovd
read
over
julias
heart
thy
first
best
love
for
whose
dear
sake
thou
didst
then
rend
thy
faith
into
a
thousand
oaths
and
all
those
oaths
descended
into
perjury
to
love
me
thou
hast
no
faith
left
now
unless
thoudst
two
and
thats
far
worse
than
none
better
have
none
than
plural
faith
which
is
too
much
by
one
thou
counterfeit
to
thy
true
friend
in
love
who
respects
friend
all
men
but
proteus
nay
if
the
gentle
spirit
of
moving
words
can
no
way
change
you
to
a
milder
form
ill
woo
you
like
a
soldier
at
arms
end
and

you
gainst
the
nature
of
love
force

faith
or
love

a
friend

beguild
my
hopes

mine
eye

disprove
me
who

perjurd
to
the
bosom
proteus
i
am
sorry

more
degenerate

slight
conditions

our
discourse
to
make

story
of
your
loves
discovered
that
done
our
day
of
marriage
shall
be
yours
one
feast
one
house
one
mutual
happiness
the
winters
tale
if
you
shall
chance
camillo
to
visit
bohemia
on
the
like
occasion
whereon
my
services
are
now
on
foot
you
shall
see
as
i
have
said
great
difference
betwixt
our
bohemia
and
your
sicilia

think
this
coming
summer
the
king
of
sicilia
means
to
pay
bohemia
the
visitation
which
he
justly
owes
him
wherein
our
entertainment
shall
shame
us
we
will
be
justified
in
our
loves
for
indeed
beseech
you
verily
i
speak
it
in
the
freedom
of
my
knowledge
we
cannot
with
such
magnificence
in
so
rare
i
know
not
what
to
say
we
will
give
you
sleepy
drinks
that
your
senses
unintelligent
of
our
insufficience
may
though
they
cannot
praise
us
as
little
accuse
us
you
pay
a
great
deal
too
dear
for
whats
given
freely
believe
me
i
speak
as
my
understanding
instructs
me
and
as
mine
honesty
puts
it
to
utterance
sicilia
cannot
show
himself
overkind
to
bohemia
they
were
trained
together
in
their
childhoods
and
there
rooted
betwixt
them
then
such
an
affection
which
cannot
choose
but
branch
now
since
their
more
mature
dignities
and
royal
necessities
made
separation
of
their
society
their
encounters
though
not
personal
have
been
royally
attorneyed
with
interchange
of
gifts
letters
loving
embassies
that
they
have
seemed
to
be
together
though
absent
shook
hands
as
over
a
vast
and
embraced
as
it
were
from
the
ends
of
opposed
winds
the
heavens
continue
their
loves
i
think
there
is
not
in
the
world
either
malice
or
matter
to
alter
it
you
have
an
unspeakable
comfort
of
your
young
prince
mamilhus
it
is
a
gentleman
of
the
greatest
promise
that
ever
came
into
my
note
i
very
well
agree
with
you
in
the
hopes
of
him
it
is
a
gallant
child
one
that
indeed
physics
the
subject
makes
old
hearts
fresh
they
that
went
on
crutches
ere
he
was
born
desire
yet
their
life
to
see
him
a
man
would
they
else
be
content
to
die
yes
if
there
were
no
other
excuse
why
they
should
desire
to
live
if
the
king
had
no
son
they
would
desire
to
live
on
crutches
till
he
had
one
nine
changes
of
the
watery
star
have
been
the
shepherds
note
since
we
have
left
our
throne
without
a
burden

long
again

be
filld
up
my

our
thanks
and

we

what
we
changd
was
innocence

pursud
that

but
why
to
satisfy
your
highness
and
the
entreaties
of
our
most
gracious
mistress
satisfy
the
entreaties
of
your
mistress
satisfy
let
that
suffice
i
have
trusted
thee
camillo
with
all
the
nearest
things
to
my
heart
as
well
my
chambercouncils
wherein
priestlike
thou
hast
cleansd
my
bosom
i
from
thee
departed
thy
penitent
reformd
but
we
have
been
deceivd
in
thy
integrity
deceivd
in
that
which
seems
so
be
it
forbid
my
lord
to
bide
upon
t
thou
art
not
honest
or
if
thou
inclinst
that
way
thou
art
a
coward
which
hoxes
honesty
behind
restraining
from
course
requird
or
else
thou
must
be
counted
a
servant
grafted
in
my
serious
trust
and
therein
negligent
or
else
a
fool
that
seest
a
game
playd
home
the
rich
stake
drawn
and
takst
it
all
for
jest
my
gracious
lord
i
may
be
negligent
foolish
and
fearful
in
every
one
of
these
no
man
is
free
but
that
his
negligence
his
folly
fear
among
the
infinite
doings
of
the
world
sometime
puts
forth
in
your
affairs
my
lord
if
ever
i
were
wilfulnegligent
it
was
my
folly
if
industriously
i
playd
the
fool
it
was
my
negligence
not
weighing
well
the
end
if
ever
fearful
to
do
a
thing
where
i
the
issue
doubted
whereof
the
execution
did
cry
out
against
the
nonperformance
twas
a
fear
which
oft
infects
the
wisest
these
my
lord
are
such
allowd
infirmities
that
honesty
is
never
free
of
but
beseech
your
grace
be
plainer
with
me
let
me
know
my
trespass
by
its
own
visage
if
i
then
deny
it
tis
none
of
mine
ha
not
you
seen
camillo
but
thats
past
doubt
you
have
or
your
eyeglass
is
thicker
than
a
cuckolds
horn
or
heard
for
to
a
vision
so
apparent
rumour
cannot
be
mute
or
thought
for
cogitation
resides
not
in
that
man
that
does
not
think
my
wife
is
slippery
if
thou
wilt
confess
or
else
be
impudently
negative
to
have
nor
eyes
nor
ears
nor
thought
then
say
my
wifes
a
hobbyhorse
deserves
a
name
as
rank
as
any
flaxwench
that
puts
to
before
her
trothplight
sayt
and
justifyt
i
would
not
be
a
standerby
to
hear
my
sovereign
mistress
clouded
so
without
my
present
vengeance
taken
shrew
my
heart
you
never
spoke
what
did
become
you
less
than
this
which
to
reiterate
were
sin
as
deep
as
that
though
true
is
whispering
nothing
is
leaning
cheek
to
cheek
is
meeting
noses
kissing
with
inside
lip
stopping
the
career
of
laughter
with
a
sigh
a
note
infallible
of
breaking
honesty
horsing
foot
on
foot
skulking
in
corners
wishing
clocks
more
swift
hours
minutes
noon
midnight
and
all
eyes
blind
with
the
pin
and
web
but
theirs
theirs
only
that
would
unseen
be
wicked
is
this
nothing
why
then
the
world
and
all
thats
int
is
nothing
the
covering
sky
is
nothing
bohemia
nothing
my
wife
is
nothing
nor
nothing
have
these
nothings
if
this
be
nothing
good
my
lord
be
curd
of
this
diseasd
opinion
and
betimes
for
tis
most
dangerous
say
it
be
tis
true
no
no
my
lord
it
is
you
lie
you
lie
i
say
thou
liest
camillo
and
i
hate
thee
pronounce
thee
a
gross
lout
a
mindless
slave
or
else
a
hovering
temporizer
that
canst
with
thine
eyes
at
once
see
good
and
evil
inclining
to
them
both
were
my
wifes
liver
infected
as
her
life
she
would
not
live
the
running
of
one
glass
who
does
infect
her
why
he
that
wears
her
like
her
medal
hanging
about
his
neck
bohemia
who
if
i
had
servants
true
about
me
that
bare
eyes
to
see
alike
mine
honour
as
their
profits
their
own
particular
thrifts
they
would
do
that
which
should
undo
more
doing
ay
and
thou
his
cupbearer
whom
i
from
meaner
form
have
benchd
and
reard
to
worship
who
mayst
see
plainly
as
heaven
sees
earth
and
earth
sees
heaven
how
i
am
galled
mightst
bespice
a
cup
to
give
mine
enemy
a
lasting
wink
which
draught
to
me
were
cordial
sir
my
lord
i
could
do
this
and
that
with
no
rash
potion
but
with
a
lingering
dram
that
should
not
work
maliciously
like
poison
but
i
cannot
believe
this
crack
to
be
in
my
dread
mistress
so
sovereingly
being
honourable
i
have
lovd
thee
make
that
thy
question
and
go
rot
dost
think
i
am
so
muddy
so
unsettled
to
appoint
myself
in
this
vexation
sully
the
purity
and
whiteness
of
my
sheets
which
to
preserve
is
sleep
which
being
spotted
is
goads
thorns
nettles
tails
of
wasps
give
scandal
to
the
blood
o
the
prince
my
son
who
i
do
think
is
mine
and
love
as
mine
without
ripe
moving
tot
would
i
do
this
could
man
so
blench
i
must
believe
you
sir
i
do
and
will
fetch
off
bohemia
fort
provided
that
when
hes
removd
your
highness
will
take
again
your
queen
as
yours
at
first
even
for
your
sons
sake
and
thereby
for
sealing
the
injury
of
tongues
in
courts
and
kingdoms
known
and
allied
to
yours
thou
dost
advise
me
even
so
as
i
mine
own
course
have
set
down
ill
give
no
blemish
to
her
honour
none
my
lord
go
then
and
with
a
countenance
as
clear
as
friendship
wears
at
feasts
keep
with
bohemia
and
with
your
queen
i
am
his
cupbearer
if
from
me
he
have
wholesome
beverage
account
me
not
your
servant
this
is
all
dot
and
thou
hast
the
one
half
of
my
heart
dot
not
thou
splitst
thine
own
ill
dot
my
lord
i
will
seem
friendly
as
thou
hast
advisd
me
o
miserable
lady
but
for
me
what
case
stand
i
in
i
must
be
the
poisoner
of
good
polixenes
and
my
ground
to
dot
is
the
obedience
to
a
master
one
who
in
rebellion
with
himself
will
have
all
that
are
his
so
too
to
do
this
deed
promotion
follows
if
i
could
find
example
of
thousands
that
had
struck
anointed
kings
and
flourishd
after
id
not
dot
but
since
nor
brass
nor
stone
nor
parchment
bears
not
one
let
villany
itself
forsweart
i
must
forsake
the
court
to
dot
or
no
is
certain
to
me
a
breakneck
happy
star
reign
now
here
comes
bohemia
this
is
strange
methinks
my
favour
here
begins
to
warp
not
speak
good
day
camillo
hail
most
royal
sir
what
is
the
news
i
the
court
none
rare
my
lord
the
king
hath
on
him
such
a
countenance
as
he
had
lost
some
province
and
a
region
lovd
as
he
loves
himself
even
now
i
met
him
with
customary
compliment
when
he
wafting
his
eyes
to
the
contrary
and
falling
a
lip
of
much
contempt
speeds
from
me
and
so
leaves
me
to
consider
what
is
breeding
that
changes
thus
his
manners
i
dare
not
know
my
lord
how
dare
not
do
not
do
you
know
and
dare
not
be
intelligent
to
me
tis
thereabouts
for
to
yourself
what
you
do
know
you
must
and
cannot
say
you
dare
not
good
camillo
your
changd
complexions
are
to
me
a
mirror
which
shows
me
mine
changd
too
for
i
must
be
a
party
in
this
alteration
finding
myself
thus
alterd
witht
there
is
a
sickness
which
puts
some
of
us
in
distemper
but
i
cannot
name
the
disease
and
it
is
caught
of
you
that
yet
are
well
how
caught
of
me
make
me
not
sighted
like
the
basilisk
i
have
lookd
on
thousands
who
have
sped
the
better
by
my
regard
but
killd
none
so
camillo
as
you
are
certainly
a
gentleman
thereto
clerklike
experiencd
which
no
less
adorns
our
gentry
than
our
parents
noble
names
in
whose
success
we
are
gentle
i
beseech
you
if
you
know
aught
which
does
behove
my
knowledge
thereof
to
be
informd
imprison
it
not
in
ignorant
concealment
i
may
not
answer
a
sickness
caught
of
me
and
yet
i
well
i
must
be
answerd
dost
thou
hear
camillo
i
conjure
thee
by
all
the
parts
of
man
which
honour
does
acknowledge
whereof
the
least
is
not
this
suit
of
mine
that
thou
declare
what
incidency
thou
dost
guess
of
harm
is
creeping
toward
me
how
far
off
how
near
which
way
to
be
prevented
if
to
be
if
not
how
best
to
bear
it
sir
i
will
tell
you
since
i
am
chargd
in
honour
and
by
him
that
i
think
honourable
therefore
mark
my
counsel
which
must
be
even
as
swiftly
followd
as
i
mean
to
utter
it
or
both
yourself
and
me
cry
lost
and
so
good
night
on
good
camillo
i
am
appointed
him
to
murder
you
by
whom
camillo
by
the
king
for
what
he
thinks
nay
with
all
confidence
he
swears
as
he
had
seent
or
been
an
instrument
to
vice
you
tot
that
you
have
touchd
his
queen
forbiddenly
o
then
my
best
blood
turn
to
an
infected
jelly
and
my
name
be
yokd
with
his
that
did
betray
the
best
turn
then
my
freshest
reputation
to
a
savour
that
may
strike
the
dullest
nostril
where
i
arrive
and
my
approach
be
shunnd
nay
hated
too
worse
than
the
greatst
infection
that
eer
was
heard
or
read
swear
his
thought
over
by
each
particular
star
in
heaven
and
by
all
their
influences
you
may
as
well
forbid
the
sea
for
to
obey
the
moon
as
or
by
oath
remove
or
counsel
shake
the
fabric
of
his
folly
whose
foundation
is
pild
upon
his
faith
and
will
continue
the
standing
of
his
body
how
should
this
grow
i
know
not
but
i
am
sure
tis
safer
to
avoid
whats
grown
than
question
how
tis
born
if
therefore
you
dare
trust
my
honesty
that
lies
enclosed
in
this
trunk
which
you
shall
bear
along
impawnd
away
tonight
your
followers
i
will
whisper
to
the
business
and
will
by
twos
and
threes
at
several
posterns
clear
them
othe
city
for
myself
ill
put
my
fortunes
to
your
service
which
are
here
by
this
discovery
lost
be
not
uncertain
for
by
the
honour
of
my
parents
i
have
utterd
truth
which
if
you
seek
to
prove
i
dare
not
stand
by
nor
shall
you
be
safer
than
one
condemnd
by
the
kings
own
mouth
thereon
his
execution
sworn
i
do
believe
thee
i
saw
his
heart
ins
face

thy
places

still
neighbour

my
people

jealousy
is
for
a
precious
creature
as
shes
rare
must
it
be
great
and
as
his
persons
mighty
must
it
be
violent
and
as
he
does
conceive
he
is
dishonourd
by
a
man
which

his
eye

known
how
he
hath
drunk
he
cracks
his
gorge
his
sides
with
violent
hefts

plot
against

mistrusted
that
false
villain
whom
i
employd
was
preemployd
by
him
he
has
discoverd
my
design
and
i
remain
a
pinchd
thing
yea
a
very
trick
for
them
to
play
at
will
how
came
the
posterns
so
easily
open
by
his
great
authority
which
often
hath
no
less
prevaild
than
so
on
your
command
i
knowt
too
well
give
me
the
boy
i
am
glad
you
did
not
nurse
him
though
he
does
bear
some
signs
of
me
yet
you
have
too
much
blood
in
him
what
is
this
sport
bear
the
boy
hence
he
shall
not
come
about
her
away
with
him
and
let
her
sport
herself
with
that
shes
big
with
for
tis
polixenes
has
made
thee
swell
thus
but
id
say
he
had
not
and
ill
be
sworn
you
would
believe
my
saying
howeer
you
lean
to
the
nayward
you
my
lords
look
on
her
mark
her
well
be
but
about
to
say
she
is
a
goodly
lady
and
the
justice
of
your
hearts
will
thereto
add
tis
pity
shes
not
honest
honourable
praise
her
but
for
this
her
withoutdoor
form
which
on
my
faith
deserves
high
speech
and
straight
the
shrug
the
hum
or
ha
these
petty
brands
that
calumny
doth
use
o
i
am
out
that
mercy
does
for
calumny
will
sear
virtue
itself
these
shrugs
these
hums
and
has
when
you
have
said
shes
goodly
come
between
ere
you
can
say
shes
honest
but
bet
known
from
him
that
has
most
cause
to
grieve
it
should
be
shes
an
adulteress
should
a
villain
say
so
the
most
replenishd
villain
in
the
world
he
were
as
much
more
villain
you
my
lord
do
but
mistake
you
have
mistook
my
lady
polixenes
for
leontes
o
thou
thing
which
ill
not
call
a
creature
of
thy
place
lest
barbarism
making
me
the
precedent
should
a
like
language
use
to
all
degrees
and
mannerly
distinguishment
leave
out
betwixt
the
prince
and
beggar
i
have
said
shes
an
adulteress
i
have
said
with
whom
more
shes
a
traitor
and
camillo
is
a
federary
with
her
and
one
that
knows
what
she
should
shame
to
know
herself
but
with
her
most
vile
principal
that
shes
a
bedswerver
even
as
bad
as
those
that
vulgars
give
boldst
titles
ay
and
privy
to
this
their
late
escape
no
by
my
life
privy
to
none
of
this
how
will
this
grieve
you
when
you
shall
come
to
clearer
knowledge
that
you
thus
have
publishd
me
gentle
my
lord
you
scarce
can
right
me
throughly
then
to
say
you
did
mistake
no
if
i
mistake
in
those
foundations
which
i
build
upon
the
centre
is
not
big
enough
to
bear
a
schoolboys
top
away
with
her
to
prison
he
who
shall
speak
for
her
is
afar
off
guilty
but
that
he

must
be
patient
till

with
an
aspect

business
with
a
sense
as
cold
as
is
a
dead
mans
nose
but
i
do
seet
and
feelt
as
you
feel
doing
thus
and
see
withal
the
instruments
that
feel
if
it
be
so
we
need
no
grave
to
bury
honesty
theres
not
a
grain
of
it
the
face
to
sweeten
of
the
whole
dungy
earth
what
lack
i
credit
i
had
rather
you
did
lack
than
i
my
lord
upon
this
ground
and
more
it
would
content
me
to
have
her
honour
true
than
your
suspicion
be
blamd
fort
how
you
might
why
what
need
we
commune
with
you
of
this
but
rather
follow
our
forceful
instigation
our
prerogative
calls
not
your
counsels
but
our
natural
goodness
imparts
this
which
if
you
or
stupified
or
seeming
so
in
skill
cannot
or
will
not
relish
a
truth
like
us
inform
yourselves
we
need
no
more
of
your
advice
the
matter
the
loss
the
gain
the
ordering
ont
is
all
properly
ours
and
i
wish
my
liege
you
had
only
in
your
silent
judgment
tried
it
without
more
overture
how
could
that
be
either
thou
art
most
ignorant
by
age
or
thou
wert
born
a
fool
camillos
flight
added
to
their
familiarity
which
was
as
gross
as
ever
touchd
conjecture
that
lackd
sight
only
nought
for
approbation
but
only
seeing
all
other
circumstances
made
up
to
the

doth
push
on
this
proceeding
yet
for
a
greater
confirmation
for
in
an
act
of
this
importance
twere
most
piteous
to
be
wild

i
done
well
well
done
my

though
i
am
satisfied

give
rest
to
the
minds
of
others
such
as
he
whose
ignorant
credulity
will
not
come
up
to
the

so
have
we
thought
it
good
from

left
her
to
perform

of
all
the

the

voice
o

oracle
kin
to
joves
thunder
so
surprisd
my
sense
that
i
was
nothing
if
the
event
o

journey
prove
as
successful
to
the
queen
o

so
as
it
hath

the

worth

turn
all
to
the

these
proclamations
so
forcing
faults
upon
hermione
i
little
like
the
violent
carriage
of
it
will
clear
or
end
the
business
when
the
oracle
thus
by
apollos
great
divine
seald
up
shall
the
contents
discover
something
rare
even
then
will
rush
to
knowledge
go
fresh
horses
and
gracious
be
the
issue
this
sessions
to
our
great
grief
we
pronounce
even
pushes
gainst
our
heart
the
party
tried
the
daughter
of
a
king
our
wife
and
one
of
us
too
much
belovd
let
us
be
cleard
of
being
tyrannous
since
we
so
openly
proceed
in
justice
which
shall
have
due
course
even
to
the
guilt
or
the
purgation
produce
the
prisoner
it
is
his
highness
pleasure
that
the
queen
appear
in
person
here
in
court
silence
read
the
indictment
hermione
queen
to
the
worthy
leontes
king
of
sicilia
thou
art
here
accused
and
arraigned
of
high
treason
in
committing
adultery
with
polixenes
king
of
bohemia
and
conspiring
with
camillo
to
take
away
the
life
of
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
thy
royal
husband
the
pretence
whereof
being
by
circumstances
partly
laid
open
thou
hermione
contrary
to
the
faith
and
allegiance
of
a
true
subject
didst
counsel
and
aid
them
for
their
better
safety
to
fly
away
by
night
since
what
i
am
to
say
must
be
but
that
which
contradicts
my
accusation
and
the
testimony
on
my
part
no
other
but
what
comes
from
myself
it
shall
scarce
boot
me
to
say
not
guilty
mine
integrity
being
counted
falsehood
shall
as
i
express
it
be
so
receivd
but
thus
if
powers
divine
behold
our
human
actions
as
they
do
i
doubt
not
then
but
innocence
shall
make
false
accusation
blush
and
tyranny
tremble
at
patience
you
my
lord
best
know
who
least
will
seem
to
do
so
my
past
life
hath
been
as
continent
as
chaste
as
true
as
i
am
now
unhappy
which
is
more
than
history
can
pattern
though
devisd
and
playd
to
take
spectators
for
behold
me
a
fellow
of
the
royal
bed
which
owe
a
moiety
of
the
throne
a
great
kings
daughter
the
mother
to
a
hopeful
prince
here
standing
to
prate
and
talk
for
life
and
honour
fore
who
please
to
come
and
hear
for
life
i
prize
it
as
i
weigh
grief
which
i
would
spare
for
honour
tis
a
derivative
from
me
to
mine
and
only
that
i
stand
for
i
appeal
to
your
own
conscience
sir
before
polixenes
came
to
your
court
how
i
was
in
your
grace
how
merited
to
be
so
since
he
came
with
what
encounter
so
uncurrent
i
have
straind
to
appear
thus
if
one
jot
beyond
the
bound
of
honour
or
in
act
or
will
that
way
inclining
hardend
be
the
hearts
of
all
that
hear
me
and
my
nearst
of
kin
cry
fie
upon
my
grave
i
neer
heard
yet
that
any
of
these
bolder
vices
wanted
less
impudence
to
gainsay
what
they
did
than
to
perform
it
first
thats
true
enough
though
tis
a
saying
sir
not
due
to
me
you
will
not
own
it
more
than
mistress
of
which
comes
to
me
in
name
of
fault
i
must
not
at
all
acknowledge
for
polixenes
with
whom
i
am
accusd
i
do
confess
i
lovd
him
as
in
honour
he
requird
with
such
a
kind
of
love
as
might
become
a
lady
like
me
with
a
love
even
such
so
and
no
other
as
yourself
commanded
which
not
to
have
done
i
think
had
been
in
me
both
disobedience
and
ingratitude
to
you
and
toward
your
friend
whose
love
had
spoke
even
since
it
could
speak
from
an
infant
freely
that
it
was
yours
now
for
conspiracy
i
know
not
how
it
tastes
though
it
be
dishd
for
me
to
try
how
all
i
know
of
it
is
that
camillo
was
an
honest
man
and
why
he
left
your
court
the
gods
themselves
wotting
no
more
than
i
are
ignorant
you
knew
of
his
departure
as
you
know
what
you
have
undertaen
to
do
ins
absence
sir
you
speak
a
language
that
i
understand
not
my
life
stands
in
the
level
of
your
dreams
which
ill
lay
down
your
actions
are
my
dreams
you
had
a
bastard
by
polixenes
and
i
but
dreamd
it
as
you
were
past
all
shame
those
of
your
fact
are
so
so
past
all
truth
which
to
deny
concerns
more
than
avails
for
as
thy
brat
hath
been
cast
out
like
to
itself
no
father
owning
it
which
is
indeed
more
criminal
in
thee
than
it
so
thou
shalt
feel
our
justice
in
whose
easiest
passage
look
for
no
less
than
death
sir
spare
your
threats
the
bug
which
you
would
fright
me
with
i
seek
to
me
can
life
be
no
commodity
the
crown
and
comfort
of
my
life
your
favour
i
do
give
lost
for
i
do
feel
it
gone
but
know
not
how
it
went
my
second
joy
and
firstfruits
of
my
body
from
his
presence
i
am
barrd
like
one
infectious
my
third
comfort
starrd
most
unluckily
is
from
my
breast
the
innocent
milk
in
its
most
innocent
mouth
hald
out
to
murder
myself
on
every
post
proclaimd
a
strumpet
with
immodest
hatred
the
childbed
privilege
denied
which
longs
to
women
of
all
fashion
lastly
hurried
here
to
this
place
ithe
open
air
before
i
have
got
strength
of
limit
now
my
liege
tell
me
what
blessings
i
have
here
alive
that
i
should
fear
to
die
therefore
proceed
but
yet
hear
this
mistake
me
not
no
life
i
prize
it
not
a
straw
but
for
mine
honour
which
i
would
free
if
i
shall
be
condemnd
upon
surmises
all
proofs
sleeping
else
but
what
your
jealousies
awake
i
tell
you
tis
rigour
and
not
law
your
honours
all
i
do
refer
me
to
the
oracle
apollo
be
my
judge
this
your
request
is
altogether
just
therefore
bring
forth
and
in
apollos
name
his
oracle
the
emperor
of
russia
was
my
father
o
that
he
were
alive
and
here
beholding
his
daughters
trial
that
he
did
but
see
the
flatness
of
my
misery
yet
with
eyes
of
pity
not
revenge
you
here
shall
swear
upon
this
sword
of
justice
that
you
cleomenes
and
dion
have
been
both
at
delphos
and
from
thence
have
brought
this
sealdup
oracle
by
the
hand
deliverd
of
great
apollos
priest
and
that
since
then
you
have
not
dard
to
break
the
holy
seal
nor
read
the
secrets
int
all
this
we
swear
all
this
we
swear
break
up
the
seals
and
read
hermione
is
chaste
polixenes
blameless
camillo
a
true
subject
leontes
a
jealous
tyrant
his
innocent
babe
truly
begotten
and
the
king
shall
live
without
an
heir
if
that
which
is
lost
be
not
found
now
blessed
be
the
great
apollo
praised
hast
thou
read
truth
ay
my
lord
even
so
as
it
is
here
set
down
there
is
no
truth
at
all
i
the
oracle
the
sessions
shall
proceed
this
is
mere
falsehood
my
lord
the
king
the
king
what
is
the
business
o
sir
i
shall
be
hated
to
report
it
the
prince
your
son
with
mere
conceit
and
fear
of
the
queens
speed
is
gone
how
gone
is
dead
apollos
angry
and
the
heavens
themselves
do
strike
at
my
injustice
how
now
there
this
news
is
mortal
to
the
queen
look
down
and
see
what
death
is
doing
take
her
hence
her
heart
is
but
oerchargd
she
will
recover
i
have
too
much
believd
mine
own
suspicion
beseech
you
tenderly
apply
to
her
some
remedies
for
life
apollo
pardon
my
great
profaneness
gainst
thine
oracle
ill
reconcile
me
to
polixenes
new
woo
my
queen
recall
the
good
camillo
whom
i
proclaim
a
man
of
truth
of
mercy
for
being
transported
by
my
jealousies
to
bloody
thoughts
and
to
revenge
i
chose
camillo
for
the
minister
to
poison
my
friend
polixenes
which
had
been
done
but
that
the
good
mind
of
camillo
tardied
my
swift
command
though
i
with
death
and
with
reward
did
threaten
and
encourage
him
not
doing
it
and
being
done
he
most
humane
and
filld
with
honour
to
my
kingly
guest
unclaspd
my
practice
quit
his
fortunes
here
which
you
knew
great
and
to
the
certain
hazard
of
all
incertainties
himself
commended
no
richer
than
his
honour
how
he
glisters
thorough
my
rust
and
how
his
piety
does
my
deeds
make
the
blacker
woe
the
while
o
cut
my
lace
lest
my
heart
cracking
it
break
too
what
fit
is
this
good
lady
what
studied
torments
tyrant
hast
for
me
what
wheels
racks
fires
what
flaying
or
what
boiling
in
leads
or
oils
what
old
or
newer
torture
must
i
receive
whose
every
word
deserves
to
taste
of
thy
most
worst
thy
tyranny
together
working
with
thy
jealousies
fancies
too
weak
for
boys
too
green
and
idle
for
girls
of
nine
o
think
what
they
have
done
and
then
run
mad
indeed
stark
mad
for
all
thy
bygone
fooleries
were
but
spices
of
it
that
thou
betraydst
polixenes
twas
nothing
that
did
but
show
thee
of
a
fool
inconstant
and
damnable
ingrateful
nor
wast
much
thou
wouldst
have
poisond
good
camillos
honour
to
have
him
kill
a
king
poor
trespasses
more
monstrous
standing
by
whereof
i
reckon
the
casting
forth
to
crows
thy
baby
daughter
to
be
or
none
or
little
though
a
devil
would
have
shed
water
out
of
fire
ere
donet
nor
ist
directly
laid
to
thee
the
death
of
the
young
prince
whose
honourable
thoughts
thoughts
high
for
one
so
tender
cleft
the
heart
that
could
conceive
a
gross
and
foolish
sire
blemishd
his
gracious
dam
this
is
not
no
laid
to
thy
answer

things

are
heavier
than

woes

stir
therefore

thee
to
nothing
but
despair
a
thousand
knees
ten
thousand
years
together
naked
fasting
upon

exercise
so
long
i
daily
vow
to
use

unto
these
sorrows

glad
at
heart
to

heard
but
not
believd
the
spirits
o
the
dead
may
walk
again
if
such
thing
be
thy
mother
appeard
to
me
last
night
for
neer
was
dream
so
like
a
waking
to
me
comes
a
creature
sometimes
her
head
on
one
side
some
another
i
never
saw
a
vessel
of
like
sorrow
so
filld
and
so
becoming
in
pure
white
robes
like
very
sanctity
she
did
approach
my
cabin
where
i
lay
thrice
bowd
before
me
and
gasping
to
begin
some
speech
her
eyes
became
two
spouts
the
fury
spent
anon
did
this
break
from
her
good
antigonus
since
fate
against
thy
better
disposition
hath
made
thy
person
for
the
throwerout
of
my
poor
babe
according
to
thine
oath
places
remote
enough
are
in
bohemia
there
weep
and
leave
it
crying
and
for
the
babe
is
counted
lost
for
ever
perdita
i
prithee
callt
for
this
ungentle
business
put
on
thee
by
my
lord
thou
neer
shalt
see
thy
wife
paulina
more
and
so
with
shrieks
she
melted
into
air
affrighted
much
i
did
in
time
collect
myself
and
thought
this
was
so
and
no
slumber
dreams
are
toys
yet
for
this
once
yea
superstitiously
i
will
be
squard
by
this
i
do
believe
hermione
hath
sufferd
death
and
that
apollo
would
this
being
indeed
the
issue
of
king
polixenes
it
should
here
be
laid
either
for
life
or
death
upon
the
earth

its
right
father
blossom
speed

well
there
lie
and
there
thy
character
there
these
which
may
if
fortune
please
both
breed
thee
pretty
and
still
rest
thine
the
storm
begins
poor
wretch
that
for
thy
mothers
fault
art
thus
exposd
to
loss
and
what
may
follow
weep
i
cannot
but
my
heart
bleeds
and
most
accursd

sights

a
see

firmament

thrust
a
bodkins
point

it
rages
how
it

up

the
point
o
the
most
piteous
cry
of
the
poor
souls
sometimes
to
see
em
and
not
to
see
em
now
the
ship
boring
the
moon
with
her
mainmast
and
anon
swallowed
with
yest
and
froth
as
youd
thrust
a
cork
into
a
hogshead
and
then
for
the
landservice
to
see
how
the
bear
tore
out
his
shoulderbone
how
he
cried
to
me
for
help
and
said
his
name
was
antigonus
a
nobleman
but
to
make
an
end
of
the
ship
to
see
how
the
sea
flapdragoned
it
but
first
how
the
poor
souls
roared
and
the
sea
mocked
them
and
how
the
poor
gentleman
roared
and
the
bear
mocked
him
both
roaring
louder
than
the
sea
or
weather
name
of
mercy
when
was

boy

and
unfold
error
now
take
upon
me
in
the
name
of
time
to
use
my
wings
impute
it
not
a
crime
to
me
or
my
swift
passage
that
i
slide
oer
sixteen
years
and
leave
the
growth
untried
of
that
wide
gap
since
it
is
in
my
power
to
oerthrow
law
and
in
one
selfborn
hour
to
plant
and
oerwhelm
custom
let
me
pass
the
same
i
am
ere
ancientst
order
was
or
what
is
now
receivd
i
witness
to
the
times
that
brought
them
in
so
shall
i
do
to
the
freshest
things
now
reigning
and
make
stale
the
glistering
of
this
present
as
my
tale
now
seems
to
it
your
patience
this
allowing
i
turn
my
glass
and
give
my
scene
such
growing
as
you
had
slept
between
leontes
leaving
the
effects
of
his
fond
jealousies
so
grieving
that
he
shuts
up
himself
imagine
me
gentle
spectators
that
i
now
may
be
in
fair
bohemia
and
remember
well
i
mentiond
a
son
o
the
kings
which
florizel
i
now
name
to
you
and
with
speed
so
pace
to
speak
of
perdita
now
grown
in
grace
equal
with
wondering
what
of
her
ensues
i
list
not
prophesy
but
let
times
news
be
known
when
tis
brought
forth
a
shepherds
daughter
and
what
to
her
adheres
which
follows
after
is
th
argument
of
time
of
this
allow
if
ever
you
have
spent
time
worse
ere
now
if
never
yet
that
time
himself
doth
say
he
wishes
earnestly
you
never
may
i
pray
thee
good
camillo
be
no
more
importunate
tis
a
sickness
denying
thee
anything
a
death
to
grant
this
it
is
fifteen
years
since
i
saw
my
country
though
i
have
for
the
most
part
been
aired
abroad
i
desire
to
lay
my
bones
there
besides
the
penitent
king
my
master
hath
sent
for
me
to
whose
feeling
sorrows
i
might
be
some
allay
or
i
oerween
to
think
so
which
is
another
spur
to
my
departure
as
thou
lovest
me
camillo
wipe
not
out
the
rest
of
thy
services
by
leaving
me
now
the
need
i
have
of
thee
thine
own
goodness
hath
made
better
not
to
have
had
thee
than
thus
to
want
thee
thou
having
made
me
businesses
which
none
without
thee
can
sufficiently
manage
must
either
stay
to
execute
them
thyself
or
take
away
with
thee
the
very
services
thou
hast
done
which
if
i
have
not
enough
considered
as
too
much
i
cannot
to
be
more
thankful
to
thee
shall
be
my
study
and
my
profit
therein
the
heaping
friendships
of
that
fatal
country
sicilia
prithee
speak
no
more
whose
very
naming
punishes
me
with
the
remembrance
of
that
penitent
as
thou
callest
him
and
reconciled
king
my
brother
whose
loss
of
his
most
precious
queen
and
children
are
even
now
to
be
afresh
lamented
say
to
me
when
sawest
thou
the
prince
florizel
my
son
kings
are
no
less
unhappy
their
issue
not
being
gracious
than
they
are
in
losing
them
when
they
have
approved
their
virtues
sir
it
is
three
days
since
i
saw
the
prince
what
his
happier
affairs
may
be
are
to
me
unknown
but
i
have
missingly
noted
he
is
of
late
much
retired
from
court
and
is
less
frequent
to
his
princely
exercises
than
formerly
he
hath
appeared
i
have
considered
so
much
camillo
and
with
some
care
so
far
that
i
have
eyes
under
my
service
which
look
upon
his
removedness
from
whom
i
have
this
intelligence
that
he
is
seldom
from
the
house
of
a
most
homely
shepherd
a
man
they
say
that
from
very
nothing
and
beyond
the
imagination
of
his
neighbours
is
grown
into
an
unspeakable
estate
i
have
heard
sir
of
such
a
man
who
hath
a
daughter
of
most
rare
note
the
report
of
her
is
extended
more
than
can
be
thought
to
begin
from
such
a
cottage
thats
likewise
part
of
my
intelligence
but
i
fear
the
angle
that
plucks
our
son
thither
thou
shalt
accompany
us
to
the
place
where
we
will
not
appearing
what
we
are
have
some
question
with
the
shepherd
from
whose
simplicity
i
think
it
not
uneasy
to
get
the
cause
of
my
sons
resort
thither
prithee
be
my
present
partner
in
this
business
and
lay
aside
the
thoughts
of
sicilia
i
willingly
obey
your
command
my
best
camillo
we
must
disguise
ourselves
when
daffodils
begin
to
peer
with
heigh
the
doxy
over
the
dale
why
then
comes
in
the
sweet
o
the
year
for
the
red
blood
reigns
in
the
winters
pale
the
white
sheet
bleaching
on
the
hedge
with
heigh
the
sweet
birds
o
how
they
sing
doth
set
my
pugging
tooth
on
edge
for
a
quart
of
ale
is
a
dish
for
a
king
the
lark
that
tirralirra
chants
with
heigh
with
heigh
the
thrush
and
the
jay
are
summer
songs
for
me
and
my
aunts
while
we
lie
tumbling
in
the
hay
i
have
served
prince
florizel
and
in
my
time
wore
threepile
but
now
i
am
out
of
service
but
shall
i
go
mourn
for
that
my
dear
the
pale
moon
shines
by
night
and
when
i
wander
here
and
there
i
then
do
most
go
right
if
tinkers
may
have
leave
to
live
and
bear
the
sowskin
bowget
then
my
account
i
well
may
give
and
in
the
stocks
avouch
it
my
traffic
is
sheets
when
the
kite
builds
look
to
lesser
linen
my
father
named
me
autolycus
who
being
as
i
am
littered
under
mercury
was
likewise
a
snapperup
of
unconsidered
trifles
with
die
and
drab
i
purchased
this
caparison
and
my
revenue
is
the
silly
cheat
gallows
and
knock
are
too
powerful
on
the
highway
beating
and
hanging
are
terrors
to
me
for
the
life
to
come
i
sleep
out
the
thought
of
it
a
prize

me
see

loathsomeness

of
his
virtues

say
theres
no
virtue
whipped
out
of
the
court
they
cherish
it
to

know
this
man
well
he
hath
been
since
an
apebearer
then
a
processserver
a
bailiff
then
he
compassed
a
motion
of
the
prodigal
son
and
married
a
tinkers
wife
within
a
mile
where
my
land
and
living
lies
and
having
flown
over
many
knavish
professions

your
sheepshearing

if
i
make
not
this
cheat
bring
out
another
and
the
shearers

sheep
let
me
be
unrolled
and
my
name
put
in
the
book
of
virtue
jog
on
jog
on
the
footpath
way
and
merrily
hent
the
stilea
a
merry
heart
goes
all
the
day
your
sad
tares
in
a
milea
these
your
unusual
weeds
to
each
part
of
you
do
give
a
life
no
shepherdess
but
flora
peering
in
aprils
front
this
your
sheepshearing
is
as
a
meeting
of
the
petty
gods
and
you
the
queen
ont
sir
my
gracious
lord
to
chide
at
your
extremes
it
not
becomes
me
o
pardon
that
i
name
them
your
high
self
the
gracious
mark
o
the
land
you
have
obscurd
with
a
swains
wearing
and
me
poor
lowly
maid
most
goddesslike
prankd
up
but
that
our
feasts
in
every
mess
have
folly
and
the
feeders
digest
it
with
a
custom
i
should
blush
to
see
you
so
attired
swoon
i
think
to
show
myself
a
glass
i
bless
the
time
when
my
good
falcon
made
her
flight
across
thy
fathers
ground
now
jove
afford
you
cause
to
me
the
difference
forges
dread
your
greatness
hath
not
been
usd
to
fear
even
now
i
tremble
to
think
your
father
by
some
accident
should
pass
this
way
as
you
did
o
the
fates
how
would
he
look
to
see
his
work
so
noble
vilely
bound
up
what
would
he
say
or
how
should
i
in
these
my
borrowd
flaunts
behold
the
sternness
of
his
presence
apprehend
nothing
but
jollity
the
gods
themselves
humbling
their
deities
to
love
have
taken
the
shapes
of
beasts
upon
them
jupiter
became
a
bull
and
bellowd
the
green
neptune
a
ram
and
bleated
and
the
firerobd
god
golden
apollo
a
poor
humble
swain
as
i
seem
now
their
transformations
were
never
for
a
piece
of
beauty
rarer
nor
in
a
way
so
chaste
since
my
desires
run
not
before
mine
honour
nor
my
lusts
burn
hotter
than
my
faith
o
but
sir
your
resolution
cannot
hold
when
tis
opposd
as
it
must
be
by
the
power
of
the
king
one
of
these
two
must
be
necessities
which
then
will
speak
that
you
must
change
this
purpose
or
i
my
life
thou
dearest
perdita
with
these
forcd
thoughts
i
prithee
darken
not
the
mirth
o
the
feast
or
ill
be
thine
my
fair
or
not
my
fathers
for
i
cannot
be
mine
own
nor
anything
to
any
if
i
be
not
thine
to
this
i
am
most
constant
though
destiny
say
no
be
merry
gentle
strangle
such
thoughts
as
these
with
any
thing
that
you
behold
the
while
your
guests
are
coming
lift
up
your
countenance
as
it
were
the
day
of
celebration

with
flowers
of
winter
sir
the
year
growing
ancient
not
yet
on
summers
death
nor
on
the
birth
of
trembling
winter
the
fairest
flowers
o
the
season
are
our
carnations
and
streakd
gillyvors
which
some
call
natures
bastards
of
that
kind
our
rustic
gardens
barren
and
i
care
not
to
get
slips
of
them
wherefore
gentle
maiden
do
you
neglect
them
for
i
have
heard
it
said
there
is
an
art
which
in
their
piedness
shares
with
great
creating
nature
say
there
be
yet
nature
is
made
better
by
no
mean
but
nature
makes
that
mean
so
over
that
art
which
you
say
adds
to
nature
is
an
art
that
nature
makes
you
see
sweet
maid
we
marry
a
gentler
scion
to
the
wildest
stock
and
make
conceive
a
bark
of
baser
kind
by
bud
of
nobler
race
this
is
an
art
which
does
mend
nature
change
it
rather
but
the
art
itself
is
nature
so
it
is
then
make
your
garden
rich
in
gillyvors
and
do
not
call
them
bastards
ill
not
put
the
dibble
in
earth
to
set
one
slip
of
them
no
more
than
were
i
painted
i
would
wish
this
youth
should
say
twere
well
and
only
therefore
desire
to
breed
by
me
heres
flowers
for
you
hot
lavender
mints
savory
marjoram
the
marigold
that
goes
to
bed
wi
the
sun
and
with
him
rises
weeping
these
are
flowers
of
middle
summer
and
i
think
they
are
given
to
men
of
middle
age
youre
very
welcome
i
should
leave
grazing
were
i
of
your
flock
and
only
live
by
gazing

alas
youd
be
so
lean
that
blasts
of
january
would
blow
you
through
and
through
now
my
fairst
friend
i
would
i
had
some
flowers
o
the
spring
that

become
your
time
of
day
and
yours
and
yours
that
wear
upon
your
virgin
branches
yet
your
maidenheads
growing
o
proserpina
for
the
flowers
now
that
frighted
thou
letst
fall
from
diss
waggon
daffodils
that
come
before
the
swallow
dares
and
take
the
winds
of
march
with
beauty
violets
dim
but
sweeter
than
the
lids
of
junos
eyes
or
cythereas
breath
pale
primeroses
that
die
unmarried
ere
they
can
behold
bright
ph
bus
in
his
strength
a
malady
most
incident
to
maids
bold
oxlips
and
the
crown
imperial
lilies
of
all
kinds
the
flowerdeluce
being
one
o
these
i
lack
to
make
you
garlands
of
and
my
sweet
friend
to
strew
him
oer
and
oer
what
like
a
corse
no
like
a
bank
for
love
to
lie
and
play
on
not
like
a
corse
or
if
not
to
be
buried
but
quick
and
in
mine
arms
come
take
your
flowers
methinks
i
play
as
i
have
seen
them
do
in
whitsun
pastorals
sure
this
robe
of
mine
does
change
my
disposition
what
you
do
still
betters
what
is
done
when
you
speak
sweet
id
have
you
do
it
ever
when
you
sing
id
have
you
buy
and
sell
so
so
give
alms
pray
so
and
for
the
ordering
your
affairs
to
sing
them
too
when
you
do
dance
i
wish
you
a
wave
o
the
sea
that
you
might
ever
do
nothing
but
that
move
still
still
so
and
own
no
other
function
each
your
doing
so
singular
in
each
particular
crowns
what
you
are
doing
in
the
present
deed
that
all
your
acts
are
queens
o
doricles
your
praises
are
too
large
but
that
your
youth
and
the
true
blood
which
fairly
peeps
through
it
do
plainly
give
you
out
an
unstaind
shepherd
with
wisdom
i
might
fear
my
doricles
you
wood
me
the
false
way
i
think
you
have
as
little
skill
to
fear
as
i
have
purpose
to
put
you
tot
but
come
our
dance
i
pray
your
hand
my
perdita
so
turtles
pair
that
never
mean
to
part
ill
swear
for
em
this
is
the
prettiest
lowborn
lass
that
ever
ran
on
the
greensord
nothing
she
does
or
seems
but
smacks
of
something
greater
than
herself
too
noble
for
this
place
he
tells
her
something
that
makes
her
blood
look
out
good
sooth
she
is
the
queen
of
curds
and
cream
come
on
strike
up
mopsa
must
be
your
mistress
marry
garlic
to
mend
her
kissing
with
now
in
good
time
not
a
word
a
word
we
stand
upon
our
manners
come
strike
up
pray
good
shepherd
what
fair
swain
is
this
which
dances
with
your
daughter
they
call
him
doricles
and
boasts
himself
to
have
a
worthy
feeding
but
i
have
it
upon
his
own
report
and
i
believe
it
he
looks
like
sooth
he
says
he
loves
my
daughter
i
think
so
too
for
never
gazd
the
moon
upon
the
water
as
hell
stand
and
read
as
twere
my
daughters
eyes
and
to
be
plain
i
think
there
is
not
half
a
kiss
to
choose
who
loves
another
best
she
dances
featly
so
she
does
any
thing
though
i
report
it
that
should
be
silent
if
young
doricles
do
light
upon
her
she
shall
bring
him
that
which
he
not
dreams
of
o
master
if
you
did
but
hear
the
pedlar
at
the
door
you
would
never
dance
again
after
a
tabor
and
pipe
no
the
bagpipe
could
not
move
you
he
sings
several
tunes
faster
than
youll
tell
money
he
utters
them
as
he
had
eaten
ballads
and
all
mens
ears
grew
to
his
tunes
he
could
never
come
better
he
shall
come
in
i
love
a
ballad
but
even
too
well
if
it
be
doleful
matter
merrily
set
down
or
a
very
pleasant
thing
indeed
and
sung
lamentably
he
hath
songs
for
man
or
woman
of
all
sizes
no
milliner
can
so
fit
his
customers
with
gloves
he
has
the
prettiest
lovesongs
for
maids
so
without
bawdry
which
is
strange
with
such
delicate
burthens
of
dildos
and
fadings
jump
her
and
thump
her
and
where
some
stretchmouthed
rascal
would
as
it
were
mean
mischief
and
break
a
foul
gap
into
the
matter
he
makes
the
maid
to
answer
whoop
do
me
no
harm
good
man
puts
him
off
slights
him
with
whoop
do
me
no
harm
good
man
this
is
a
brave
fellow
believe
me
thou
talkest
of
an
admirable
conceited
fellow
has
he
any
unbraided
wares
he
hath
ribands
of
all
the
colours
i
the
rainbow
points
more
than
all
the
lawyers
in
bohemia
can
learnedly
handle
though
they
come
to
him
by
the
gross
inkles
caddisses
cambrics
lawns
why
he
sings
em
over
as
they
were
gods
or
goddesses
you
would
think
a
smock
were
a

so
chants
to

fourscore
of
april
forty
thousand
fathom
above
water
and
sung
this
ballad
against
the
hard
hearts
of
maids
it
was
thought
she
was
a
woman
and
was
turned
into
a
cold
fish
for
she
would
not
exchange
flesh
with
one
that
loved
her
the
ballad

very
pitiful

shepherd
your

something
that

take
your
mind
from
feasting
sooth
when
i
was
young
and
handed
love
as
you
do
i
was
wont
to
load
my
she
with
knacks
i
would
have
ransackd
the
pedlars
silken
treasury
and
have
pourd
it
to
her
acceptance
you
have
let
him
go
and
nothing
marted
with
him
if
your
lass
interpretation
should
abuse
and
call
this
your
lack
of
love
or
bounty
you
were
straited
for
a
reply
at
least
if
you
make
a
care
of
happy
holding
her
old
sir
i
know
she
prizes
not
such
trifles
as
these
are
the
gifts
she
looks
from
me
are
packd
and
lockd
up
in
my
heart
which
i
have
given
already
but
not
deliverd
o
hear
me
breathe
my
life
before
this
ancient
sir
who
it
should
seem
hath
sometime
lovd
i
take
thy
hand
this
hand
as
soft
as
doves
down
and
as
white
as
it
or
ethiopians
tooth
or
the
fannd
snow
thats
bolted
by
the
northern
blasts
twice
oer
what
follows
this
how
prettily
the
young
swain
seems
to
wash
the
hand
was
fair
before
i
have
put
you
out
but
to
your
protestation
let
me
hear
what
you
profess
do
and
be
witness
tot
and
this
my
neighbour
too
and
he
and
more
than
he
and
men
the
earth
the
heavens
and
all
that
were
i
crownd
the
most
imperial
monarch
thereof
most
worthy
were
i
the
fairest
youth
that
ever
made
eye
swerve
had
force
and
knowledge
more
than
was
ever
mans
i
would
not
prize
them
without
her
love
for
her
employ
them
all
commend
them
and
condemn
them
to
her
service
or
to
their
own
perdition
fairly
offerd
this
shows
a
sound
affection
but
my
daughter
say
you
the
like
to
him
i
cannot
speak
so
well
nothing
so
well
no
nor
mean
better
by
the
pattern
of
mine
own
thoughts
i
cut
out
the
purity
of
his
take
hands
a
bargain
and
friends
unknown
you
shall
bear
witness
tot
i
give
my
daughter
to
him
and
will
make
her
portion
equal

o
that
must
be
i
the
virtue
of
your
daughter
one
being
dead
i
shall
have
more
than
you

of
yet

for
your
wonder
but
come
on
contract

fore
these
witnesses
come
your
hand
and
daughter

soft
swain
awhile
beseech
you
have
you
a
father
i
have
but
what
of
him

does
nor
shall

a
father

at
the
nuptial
of
his
son
a
guest
that
best
becomes
the
table
pray
you
once
more
is
not
your
father
grown
incapable
of
reasonable
affairs
is
he
not
stupid
with
age
and
altering
rheums
can
he
speak
hear
know
man
from
man
dispute
his
own
estate
lies
he
not
bedrid
and
again
does
nothing
but
what
he
did
being
childish
no
good
sir
he
has
his
health
and
ampler
strength
indeed
than
most
have
of
his
age
by
my
white
beard
you
offer
him
if
this
be
so
a
wrong
something
unfilial
reason
my
son
should
choose
himself
a
wife
but
as
good
reason
the
father
all
whose
joy
is
nothing
else
but
fair
posterity
should
hold
some
counsel
in
such
a
business
i
yield
all
this
but
for
some
other
reasons
my
grave
sir
which
tis
not
fit
you
know
i
not
acquaint
my
father
of
this
business
let
him
knowt
he
shall
not
prithee
let
him
no
he
must
not
let
him
my
son
he
shall
not
need
to
grieve
at
knowing
of
thy
choice
come
come
he
must
not
mark
our
contract
mark
your
divorce
young
sir
whom
son
i
dare
not
call
thou
art
too
base
to
be
acknowledgd
thou
a
sceptres
heir
that
thus
affectst
a
sheephook
thou
old
traitor
i
am
sorry
that
by
hanging
thee
i
can
but
shorten
thy
life
one
week
and
thou
fresh
piece
of
excellent
witchcraft
who
of
force
must
know
the
royal
fool
thou
copst
with
o
my
heart
ill
have
thy
beauty
scratchd
with
briers
and
made
more
homely
than
thy
state
for
thee
fond
boy
if
i
may
ever
know
thou
dost
but
sigh
that
thou
no
more
shalt
see
this
knack
as
never
i
mean
thou
shalt
well
bar
thee
from
succession
not
hold
thee
of
our
blood
no
not
our
kin
far
than
deucalion
off
mark
thou
my
words
follow
us
to
the
court
thou
churl
for
this
time
though
full
of
our
displeasure
yet
we
free
thee
from
the
dead
blow
of
it
and
you
enchantment
worthy
enough
a
herdsman
yea
him
too
that
makes
himself
but
for
our
honour
therein
unworthy
thee
if
ever
henceforth
thou
these
rural
latches
to
his
entrance
open
or
hoop
his
body
more
with
thy
embraces
i
will
devise
a
death
as
cruel
for
thee
as
thou
art
tender
tot
even
here
undone
i
was
not
much
afeard
for
once
or
twice
i
was
about
to
speak
and
tell
him
plainly
the
selfsame
sun
that
shines
upon
his
court
hides
not
his
visage
from
our
cottage
but
looks
on
alike
willt
please
you
sir
be
gone
i
told
you
what
would
come
of
this
beseech
you
of
your
own
state
take
care
this
dream
of
mine
being
now
awake
ill
queen
it
no
inch
further
but
milk
my
ewes
and
weep
why
how
now
father
speak
ere
thou
diest
i
cannot
speak
nor
think
nor
dare
to
know
that
which
i
know
o
sir
you
have
undone
a
man
of
fourscore
three
that
thought
to
fill
his
grave
in
quiet
yea
to
die
upon
the
bed
my
father
died
to
lie
close
by
his
honest
bones
but
now
some
hangman
must
put
on
my
shroud
and
lay
me
where
no
priest
shovels
in
dust
o
cursed
wretch
that
knewst
this
was
the
prince
and
wouldst
adventure
to
mingle
faith
with
him
undone
undone
if
i
might
die
within
this
hour
i
have
livd
to
die
when
i
desire
why
look
you
so
upon
me
i
am
but
sorry
not
afeard
delayd
but
nothing
alterd
what
i
was
i
am
more
straining
on
for
plucking
back
not
following
my
leash
unwillingly
gracious
my
lord
you
know
your
fathers
temper
at
this
time
he
will
allow
no
speech
which
i
do
guess
you
do
not
purpose
to
him
and
as
hardly
will
he
endure
your
sight
as
yet
i
fear
then
till
the
fury
of
his
highness
settle
come
not
before
him
i
not
purpose
it
i
think
camillo
even
he
my
lord
how
often
have
i
told
you
twould
be
thus
how
often
said
my
dignity
would
last
but
till
twere
known
it
cannot
fail
but
by
the
violation
of
my
faith
and
then
let
nature
crush
the
sides
o
the
earth
together
and
mar
the
seeds
within
lift
up
thy
looks
from
my
succession
wipe
me
father
i
am
heir
to
my
affection
be
advisd
i
am
and
by
my
fancy
if
my
reason
will
thereto
be
obedient
i
have
reason
if
not
my
senses
better
pleasd
with
madness
do
bid
it
welcome
this
is
desperate
sir
so
call
it
but
it
does
fulfil
my
vow
i
needs
must
think
it
honesty
camillo
not
for
bohemia
nor
the
pomp
that
may
be
thereat
gleand
for
all
the
sun
sees
or
the
close
earth
wombs
or
the
profound
sea
hides
in
unknown
fathoms
will
i
break
my
oath
to
this
my
fair
belovd
therefore
i
pray
you
as
you
have
ever
been
my
fathers
honourd
friend
when
he
shall
miss
me
as
in
faith
i
mean
not
to
see
him
any
more
cast
your
good
counsels
upon
his
passion
let
myself
and
fortune
tug
for
the
time
to
come
this
you
may
know
and
so
deliver
i
am
put
to
sea
with
her
whom
here
i
cannot
hold
on
shore
and
most
opportune
to
our
need
i
have
a
vessel
rides
fast
by
but
not
prepard
for
this
design
what
course
i
mean
to
hold
shall
nothing
benefit
your
knowledge
nor
concern
me
the
reporting
o
my
lord
i
would
your
spirit
were
easier
for
advice
or
stronger
for
your
need
hark
perdita
ill
hear
you
by
and
by
hes
irremovable
resolvd
for
flight
now
were
i
happy
if
his
going
i
could
frame
to
serve
my
turn
save
him
from
danger
do
him
love
and
honour
purchase
the
sight
again
of
dear
sicilia
and
that
unhappy
king
my
master
whom
i
so
much
thirst
to
see
now
good
camillo
i
am
so
fraught
with
curious
business
that
i
leave
out
ceremony
sir
i
think
you
have
heard
of
my
poor
services
i
the
love
that
i
have
borne
your
father
very
nobly
have
you
deservd
it
is
my
fathers
music
to
speak
your
deeds
not
little
of
his
care
to
have
them
recompensd
as
thought
on
well
my
lord
if
you
may
please
to
think
i
love
the
king
and
through
him
whats
nearest
to
him
which
is
your
gracious
self
embrace
but
my
direction
if
your
more
ponderous
and
settled
project
may
suffer
alteration
on
mine
honour
ill
point
you
where
you
shall
have
such
receiving
as
shall
become
your
highness
where
you
may
enjoy
your
mistress
from
the
whom
i
see
theres
no
disjunction
to
be
made
but
by
as
heavens
forfend
your
ruin
marry
her
and
with
my
best
endeavours
in
your
absence
your
discontenting
father
strive
to
qualify
and
bring
him
up
to
liking
how
camillo
may
this
almost
a
miracle
be
done
that
i
may
call
thee
something
more
than
man
and
after
that
trust
to
thee
have
you
thought
on
a
place
whereto
youll
go
not
any
yet
but
as
the
unthoughton
accident
is
guilty
to
what
we
wildly
do
so
we
profess
ourselves
to
be
the
slaves
of
chance
and
flies
of
every
wind
that
blows
then
list
to
me
this
follows
if
you
will
not
change
your
purpose
but
undergo
this
flight
make
for
sicilia
and
there
present
yourself
and
your
fair
princess
for
so
i
see
she
must
be
fore
leontes
she
shall
be
habited
as
it
becomes
the
partner
of
your
bed
methinks
i
see
leontes
opening
his
free
arms
and
weeping
his
welcomes
forth
asks
thee
the
son
forgiveness
as
twere
i
the
fathers
person
kisses
the
hands
of
your
fresh
princess
oer
and
oer
divides
him
twixt
his
unkindness
and
his
kindness
the
one
he
chides
to
hell
and
bids
the
other
grow
faster
than
thought
or
time
worthy
camillo
what
colour
for
my
visitation
shall
i
hold
up
before
him
sent
by
the
king
your
father
to
greet
him
and
to
give
him
comforts
sir
the
manner
of
your
bearing
towards
him
with
what
you
as
from
your
father
shall
deliver
things
known
betwixt
us
three
ill
write
you
down
the
which
shall
point
you
forth
at
every
sitting
what
you
must
say
that
he
shall
not
perceive
but
that
you
have
your
fathers
bosom
there
and
speak
his
very
heart
i
am
bound
to
you
there
is
some
sap
in
this
a
course
more
promising
than
a
wild
dedication
of
yourselves
to
unpathd
waters
undreamd
shores
most
certain
to
miseries
enough
no
hope
to
help
you
but
as
you
shake
off
one
to
take
another
nothing
so
certain
as
your
anchors
who
do
their
best
office
if
they
can
but
stay
you
where
youll
be
loath
to
be
besides
you
know
prosperitys
the
very
bond
of
love
whose
fresh
complexion
and
whose
heart
together
affliction
alters
one
of
these
is
true
i
think
affliction
may
subdue
the
cheek
but
not
take
in
the
mind
yea
say
you
so
there
shall
not
at
your
fathers
house
these
seven
years
be
born
another
such
my
good
camillo
she
is
as
forward
of
her
breeding
as
she
is
i
the
rear
o
her
birth
i
cannot
say
tis
pity
she
lacks
instructions
for
she
seems
a
mistress
to
most
that
teach
your
pardon
sir
for
this
ill
blush
you
thanks
my
prettiest
perdita
but
o
the
thorns
we
stand
upon
camillo
preserver
of
my
father
now
of
me
the
medcine
of
our
house
how
shall
we
do
we
are
not
furnishd
like
bohemias
son
nor
shall
appear
in
sicilia
my
lord
fear
none
of
this
i
think
you
know
my
fortunes
do
all
lie
there
it
shall
be
so
my
care
to
have
you
royally
appointed
as
if
the
scene
you
play
were
mine
for
instance
sir
that
you
may
know
you
shall
not
want
one
word
ha
ha
what
a
fool
honesty
is
and
trust
his
sworn
brother
a
very
simple
gentleman
i
have
sold
all
my
trumpery
not
a
counterfeit
stone
not
a
riband
glass
pomander
brooch
tablebook
ballad
knife
tape
glove
shoetie
bracelet
hornring
to
keep
my
pack
from
fasting
they
throng
who
should
buy
first
as
if
my
trinkets
had
been
hallowed
and
brought
a
benediction
to
the
buyer
by
which
means
i
saw
whose
purse
was
best
in
picture
and
what
i
saw
to
my
good
use
i
remembered
my
clown
who
wants
but
something
to
be
a
reasonable
man
grew
so
in
love
with
the
wenches
song
that
he
would
not
stir
his
pettitoes
till
he
had
both
tune
and
words
which
so
drew
the
rest
of
the
herd
to
me
that
all
their
other
senses
stuck
in
ears
you
might
have
pinched
a
placket
it
was
senseless
twas
nothing
to
geld
a
codpiece
of
a
purse
i
would
have
filed
keys
off
that
hung
in
chains
no
hearing
no
feeling
but
my
sirs
song
and
admiring
the
nothing
of
it
so
that
in
this
time
of
lethargy
i
picked
and
cut
most
of
their
festival
purses
and
had
not
the
old
man
come
in
with
a
whoobub
against
his
daughter
and
the
kings
son
and
scared
my
choughs
from
the
chaff
i
had
not
left
a
purse
alive
in
the
whole
army
nay
but
my
letters
by
this
means
being
there
so
soon
as
you
arrive
shall
clear
that
doubt
and
those
that
youll
procure
from
king
leontes
shall
satisfy
your
father
happy
be
you
all
that
you
speak
shows
fair
whom
have
we
here
well
make
an
instrument
of
this

give
us

overheard

a
poor
fellow

so
still
heres
nobody
will
steal
that
from
thee
yet
for
the
outside
of
thy
poverty
we
must
make
an
exchange
therefore
discase
thee
instantly
thou
must
think
theres
a
necessity
int
and
change
garments
with
this
gentleman
though
the
pennyworth
on
his
side
be
the
worst
yet

some
boot

a
poor
fellow

flayed
already

you
in
earnest
sir

the
trick
ont
dispatch
i
prithee
indeed
i
have
had
earnest
but
i
cannot
with
conscience
take
it
unbuckle
unbuckle
fortunate
mistress
let
my
prophecy
come
home
to
ye
you
must
retire
yourself
into
some
covert
take
your
sweethearts
hat
and
pluck
it
oer
your
brows
muffle
your
face
dismantle
you
and
as
you
can
disliken
the
truth
of
your
own
seeming
that
you
may
for
i
do
fear
eyes
over
you
to
shipboard
get
undescried
i
see
the
play
so
lies
that
i
must
bear
a
part
no
remedy
have
you
done
there
should
i
now
meet
my
father
he
would
not
call
me
son
nay
you
shall
have
no
hat
come
lady
come
farewell
my
friend
adieu
sir
o
perdita
what
have
we
twain
forgot
pray
you
a
word
what
i
do
next
shall
be
to
tell
the
king
of
this
escape
and
whither
they
are
bound
wherein
my
hope
is
i
shall
so
prevail
to
force
him
after
in
whose
company
i
shall
review
sicilia
for
whose
sight
i
have
a
womans
longing
fortune
speed
us
thus
we
set
on
camillo
to
the
seaside
the
swifter
speed
the
better
i
understand
the
business
i
hear
it
to
have
an
open
ear
a
quick
eye
and
a
nimble
hand
is
necessary
for
a
cutpurse
a
good
nose
is
requisite
also
to
smell
out
work
for
the
other
senses
i
see
this
is
the
time
that
the
unjust
man
doth
thrive
what
an
exchange
had
this
been
without
boot
what
a
boot
is
here
with
this
exchange
sure
the
gods
do
this
year
connive
at
us
and
we
may
do
anything
extempore
the
prince
himself
is
about
a
piece
of
iniquity
stealing
away
from
his
father
with
his
clog
at
his
heels
if
i
thought
it
were
a
piece
of
honesty
to
acquaint
the
king
withal
i
would
not
dot
i
hold
it
the
more
knavery
to
conceal
it
and
therein
am
i
constant
to
my
profession
aside
aside
here
is
more
matter
for
a
hot
brain
every
lanes
end
every
shop
church
session
hanging
yields
a
careful
man
work
see
see
what
a
man
you
are
now
there
is
no
other
way
but
to
tell
the
king
shes
a
changeling
and
none
of
your
flesh
and
blood
nay
but
hear
me
nay
but
hear
me
go
to
then
she
being
none
of
your
flesh
and
blood
your
flesh
and
blood
has
not
offended
the
king
and
so
your
flesh
and
blood
is
not
to
be
punished
by
him
show
those
things
you
found
about
her
those
secret
things
all
but
what
she
has
with
her
this
being
done
let
the
law
go
whistle
i
warrant
you
i
will
tell
the
king
all
every
word
yea
and
his
sons
pranks
too
who
i
may
say
is
no
honest
man
neither
to
his
father
nor
to
me
to
go
about
to
make
me
the
kings
brotherinlaw
indeed
brotherinlaw
was
the
furthest
off
you
could
have
been
to
him
and
then
your
blood
had
been
the
dearer
by
i
know
not
how
much
an
ounce
very
wisely
puppies
well
let
us
to
the
king
there
is
that
in
this
fardel
will
make
him
scratch
his
beard
i
know
not
what
impediment
this
complaint
may

lie
but
we
pay

how
blessd
are
we
that
are
not
simple
men
yet
nature
might
have
made
me
as
these
are
therefore
ill
not
disdain
this
cannot
be
but
a
great
courtier
his
garments
are
rich
but
he
wears
them
not
handsomely
he
seems
to
be
the
more
noble
in
being
fantastical
a
great
man
ill
warrant
i
know
by
the
picking
ons
teeth
the
fardel
there
whats
i
the
fardel
wherefore
that
box
sir
there
lies
such
secrets
in
this
fardel
and
box
which
none
must
know
but
the
king
and
which
he
shall
know
within
this
hour
if
i
may
come
to
the
speech
of
him
age
thou
hast
lost
thy
labour
why
sir
the
king
is
not
at
the
palace
he
is
gone
aboard
a
new
ship
to
purge
melancholy
and
air
himself
for
if
thou
best
capable
of
things
serious
thou
must
know
the
king
is
full
of
grief
so
tis
said
sir
about
his
son
that
should
have
married
a
shepherds
daughter
if
that
shepherd
be
not
now
in
handfast
let
him
fly
the
curses

heart
of
monster

he
alone
shall
suffer
what
wit

make
heavy
and
vengeance
bitter
but
those
that
are
germane
to
him
though
removed
fifty
times
shall
all
come
under
the
hangman
which
though
it
be
great
pity
yet
it
is
necessary
an
old
sheepwhistling
rogue
a
ramtender
to
offer
to
have
his
daughter
come
into
grace
some
say
he
shall
be
stoned
but
that
death
is
too
soft
for
him
say
i
draw
our
throne
into
a
sheep
cote

deaths
are
too
few

wasps
nest
then
stand
till

be
three
quarters
and
a
dram
dead
then
recovered
again
with
aquavit
or
some
other
hot
infusion
then
raw
as
he
is
and
in
the
hottest
day
prognostication
proclaims
shall
he
be
set
against
a
brickwall
the
sun
looking
with
a
southward
eye
upon
him
where
he
is
to

us
good
if

me
she

in
my
mouth

am
courted
now
with
a
double
occasion

and
a
means

do
the
prince
my
master
good

who
knows
how
that
may
turn
back
to
my
advancement
i
will
bring
these
two
moles
these
blind
ones
aboard
him

he
think
it
fit
to
shore

again
and
that
the
complaint
they
have
to
the
king
concerns
him
nothing
let
him
call
me
rogue
for
being
so
far
officious
for
i
am
proof
against
that
title
and
what
shame
else
belongs
tot
to
him
will
i
present
them
there
may
be
matter
in
it
sir
you
have
done
enough
and
have
performd
a
saintlike
sorrow
no
fault
could
you
make
which
you
have
not
redeemd
indeed
paid
down
more
penitence
than
done
trespass
at
the
last
do
as
the
heavens
have
done
forget
your
evil
with
them
forgive
yourself
whilst
i
remember
her
and
her
virtues
i
cannot
forget
my
blemishes
in
them
and
so
still
think
of
the
wrong
i
did
myself
which
was
so
much
that
heirless
it
hath
made
my
kingdom
and
destroyd
the
sweetst
companion
that
eer
man
bred
his
hopes
out
of
true
too
true
my
lord
if
one
by
one
you
wedded
all
the
world
or
from
the
all
that
are
took
something
good
to
make
a
perfect
woman
she
you
killd
would
be
unparalleld
i
think
so
killd
she
i
killd
i
did
so
but
thou
strikst
me
sorely
to
say
i
did
it
is
as
bitter
upon
thy
tongue
as
in
my
thought
now
good
now
say
so
but
seldom
not
at
all
good
lady
you
might
have
spoken
a
thousand
things
that
would
have
done
the
time
more
benefit
and
gracd
your
kindness
better
you
are
one
of
those
would
have
him
wed
again
if
you
would
not
so
you
pity
not
the
state
nor
the
remembrance
of
his
most
sovereign
name
consider
little
what
dangers
by
his
highness
fail
of
issue
may
drop
upon
his
kingdom
and
devour
incertain
lookerson
what
were
more
holy
than
to
rejoice
the
former
queen
is
well
what
holier
than
for
royaltys
repair
for
present
comfort
and
for
future
good
to
bless
the
bed
of
majesty
again
with
a
sweet
fellow
tot
there
is
none
worthy
respecting
her
thats
gone
besides
the
gods
will
have
fulfilld
their
secret
purposes
for
has
not
the
divine
apollo
said
ist
not
the
tenour
of
his
oracle
that
king
leontes
shall
not
have
an
heir
till
his
lost
child
be
found
which
that
it
shall
is
all
as
monstrous
to
our
human
reason
as
my
antigonus
to
break
his
grave
and
come
again
to
me
who
on
my
life
did
perish
with
the
infant
tis
your
counsel
my
lord
should
to
the
heavens
be
contrary
oppose
against
their
wills
care
not
for
issue
the
crown
will
find
an
heir
great
alexander
left
his
to
the
worthiest
so
his
successor
was
like
to
be
the
best
good
paulina
who
hast
the
memory
of
hermione
i
know
in
honour
o
that
ever
i
had
squard
me
to
thy
counsel
then
even
now
i
might
have
lookd
upon
my
queens
full
eyes
have
taken
treasure
from
her
lips
and
left
them
more
rich
for
what
they
yielded
thou
speakst
truth
no
more
such
wives
therefore
no
wife
one
worse
and
better
usd
would
make
her
sainted
spirit
again
possess
her
corpse
and
on
this
stage
where
were
offenders
now
appear
soulvexd
and
begin
why
to
me
had
she
such
power
she
had
just
cause
she
had
and
would
incense
me
to
murder
her
i
married
i
should
so
were
i
the
ghost
that
walkd
id
bid
you
mark
her
eye
and
tell
me
for
what
dull
part
int
you
chose
her
then
id
shriek
that
even
your
ears
should
rift
to
hear
me
and
the
words
that
followd
should
be
remember
mine
stars
stars
and
all
eyes
else
dead
coals
fear
thou
no
wife
ill
have
no
wife
paulina
will
you
swear
never
to
marry
but
by
my
free
leave
never
paulina
so
be
blessd
my
spirit
then
good
my
lords
bear
witness
to
his
oath
you
tempt
him
over
much
unless
another
as
like
hermione
as
is
her
picture
affront
his
eye
good
madam
i
have
done
yet
if
my
lord
will
marry
if
you
will
sir
no
remedy
but
you
will
give
me
the
office
to
choose
you
a
queen
she
shall
not
be
so
young
as
was
your
former
but
she
shall
be
such
as
walkd
your
first
queens
ghost
it
should
take
joy
to
see
her
in
your
arms
my
true
paulina
we
shall
not
marry
till
thou
biddst
us
that
shall
be
when
your
first
queens
again
in
breath
never
till
then
one
that
gives
out
himself
prince
florizel
son
of
polixenes
with
his
princess
she
the
fairest
i
have
yet
beheld
desires
access
to
your
high
presence
what
with
him
he
comes
not
like
to
his
fathers
greatness
his
approach
so
out
of
circumstance
and
sudden
tells
us
tis
not
a
visitation
framd
but
forcd
by
need
and
accident
what
train
but
few
and
those
but
mean
his
princess
say
you
with
him
ay
the
most
peerless
piece
of
earth
i
think
that
eer
the
sun
shone
bright
on
o
hermione
as
every
present
time
doth
boast
itself
above
a
better
gone
so
must
thy
grave
give
way
to
whats
seen
now
sir
you
yourself
have
said
and
writ
so
but
your
writing
now
is
colder
than
that
theme
she
had
not
been
nor
was
not
to
be
equalld
thus
your
verse
flowd
with
her
beauty
once
tis
shrewdly
ebbd
to
say
you
have
seen
a
better
pardon
madam
the
one
i
have
almost
forgot
your
pardon
the
other
when
she
has
obtaind
your
eye
will
have
your
tongue
too
this
is
a
creature
would
she
begin
a
sect
might
quench
the
zeal
of
all
professors
else
make
proselytes
of
who
she
but
bid
follow
how
not
women
women
will
love
her
that
she
is
a
woman
more
worth
than
any
man
men
that
she
is
the
rarest
of
all
women
go
cleomenes
yourself
assisted
with
your
honourd
friends
bring
them
to
our
embracement
still
tis
strange
he
thus
should
steal
upon
us
had
our
prince
jewel
of
children
seen
this
hour
he
had
paird
well
with
this
lord
there
was
not
full
a
month
between
their
births
prithee
no
more
cease
thou
knowst
he
dies
to
me
again
when
talkd
of
sure
when
i
shall
see
this
gentleman
thy
speeches
will
bring
me
to
consider
that
which
may
unfurnish
me
of
reason
they
are
come
your
mother
was
most
true
to
wedlock
prince
for
she
did
print
your
royal
father
off
conceiving
you
were
i
but
twentyone
your
fathers
image
is
so
hit
in
you
his
very
air
that
i
should
call
you
brother
as
i
did
him
and
speak
of
something
wildly
by
us
performd
before
most
dearly
welcome
and
you
fair
princess
goddess
o
alas
i
lost
a
couple
that
twixt
heaven
and
earth
might
thus
have
stood
begetting
wonder
as
you
gracious
couple
do
and
then
i
lost
all
mine
own
folly
the
society
amity
too
of
your
brave
father
whom
though
bearing
misery
i
desire
my
life
once
more
to
look
on
him
by
his
command
have
i
here
touchd
sicilia
and
from
him
give
you
all
greetings
that
a
king
at
friend
can
send
his
brother
and
but
infirmity
which
waits
upon
worn
times
hath
something
seizd
his
wishd
ability
he
had
himself
the
land
and
waters
twixt
your
throne
and
his
measurd
to
look
upon
you
whom
he
loves
he
bade
me
say
so
more
than
all
the
sceptres
and
those
that
bear
them
living
o
my
brother
good
gentleman
the
wrongs
i
have
done
thee
stir
afresh
within
me
and
these
thy
offices
so
rarely
kind
are
as
interpreters
of
my
behindhand
slackness
welcome
hither
as
is
the
spring
to
the
earth
and
hath
he
too
exposd
this
paragon
to
the
fearful
usage
at
least
ungentle
of
the
dreadful
neptune
to
greet
a
man
not
worth
her
pains
much
less
the
adventure
of
her
person
good
my
lord
she
came
from
libya
where
the
warlike
smalus
that
noble
honourd
lord
is
feard
and
lovd
most
royal
sir
from
thence
from
him
whose
daughter
his
tears
proclaimd
his
parting
with
her
thence
a
prosperous
southwind
friendly
we
have
crossd
to
execute
the
charge
my
father
gave
me
for
visiting
your
highness
my
best
train
i
have
from
your
sicilian
shores
dismissd
who
for
bohemia
bend
to
signify
not
only
my
success
in
libya
sir
but
my
arrival
and
my
wifes
in
safety
here
where
we
are
the
blessed
gods
purge
all
infection
from
our
air
whilst
you
do
climate
here
you
have
a
holy
father
a
graceful
gentleman
against
whose
person
so
sacred
as
it
is
i
have
done
sin
for
which
the
heavens
taking
angry
note
have
left
me
issueless
and
your
fathers
blessd
as
he
from
heaven
merits
it
with
you
worthy
his
goodness
what
might
i
have
been

i
a
son
and
daughter
now
have
lookd
on
such
goodly
things
as
you
most
noble
sir

which
i
shall
report

bear
no
credit

greets
you
from

by
me
desires
you
to
attach
his
son

his
dignity
and

his
father
from
his
hopes
and
with
a
shepherds
daughter
wheres
bohemia
speak
here
in
your
city

now
came
from
him

speak
amazedly
and
it
becomes
my
marvel
and
my
message
to
your
court
whiles
he
was
hastening
in
the
chase
it
seems
of
this
fair
couple
meets
he
on
the
way
the
father
of
this
seeming
lady
and
her
brother
having
both
their
country
quitted
with
this
young
prince
camillo
has
betrayd
me
whose
honour

themselves
as
often
as
they
speak
bohemia

his
ears
and
threatens
them
with
divers
deaths

o

my
lord
is
this
the
daughter
of
a
king
she
is
when
once
she
is
my
wife
that
once
i
see
by
your
good
fathers
speed
will
come
on
very
slowly
i
am
sorry
most
sorry
you
have
broken
from
his
liking
where
you
were
tied
in
duty
and
as
sorry
your
choice
is
not
so
rich
in
worth
as
beauty
that
you
might
well
enjoy
her
dear
look
up
though
fortune
visible
an
enemy
should
chase
us
with
my
father
power
no
jot
hath
she
to
change
our
loves
beseech
you
sir
remember
since
you
owd
no
more
to
time
than
i
do
now
with
thought
of
such
affections
step
forth
mine
advocate
at
your
request
my
father
will
grant
precious
things
as
trifles
would
he
do
so
id
beg
your
precious
mistress
which
he
counts
but
a
trifle
sir
my
liege
your
eye
hath
too
much
youth
int
not
a
month
fore
your
queen
died
she
was
more
worth
such
gazes
than
what
you
look
on
now
i
thought
of
her
even
in
these
looks
i
made
but
your
petition
is
yet
unanswerd
i
will
to
your
father
your
honour
not
oerthrown
by
your
desires
i
am
friend
to
them
and
you
upon
which
errand
i
now
go
toward
him
therefore
follow
me
and
mark
what
way
i
make
come
good
my
lord
beseech
you
sir
were
you
present
at
this
relation
i
was
by
at
the
opening
of
the
fardel
heard
the
old
shepherd
deliver
the
manner
how
he
found
it
whereupon
after
a
little
amazedness
we
were
all
commanded
out
of
the
chamber
only
this
methought
i
heard
the
shepherd
say
he
found
the
child
i
would
most
gladly
know
the
issue
of
it
i
make
a
broken
delivery
of
the
business
but
the
changes
i
perceived
in
the
king
and
camillo
were
very
notes
of
admiration
they
seemed
almost
with
staring
on
one
another
to
tear
the
cases
of
their
eyes
there
was
speech
in
their
dumbness
language
in
their
very
gesture
they
looked
as
they
had
heard
of
a
world
ransomed
or
one
destroyed
a
notable
passion
of
wonder
appeared
in
them
but
the
wisest
beholder
that
knew
no
more
but
seeing
could
not
say
if
the
importance
were
joy
or
sorrow
but
in
the
extremity
of
the
one
it
must
needs
be
here
comes
a
gentleman
that
haply
knows
more
the
news
rogero
nothing
but
bonfires
the
oracle
is
fulfilled
the
kings
daughter
is
found
such
a
deal
of
wonder
is
broken
out
within
this
hour
that
balladmakers
cannot
be
able
to
express
it
here
comes
the
lady
paulinas
steward
he
can
deliver
you
more
how
goes
it
now
sir
this
news
which
is
called
true
is
so
like
an
old
tale
that
the
verity
of
it
is
in
strong
suspicion
has
the
king
found
his
heir
most
true
if
ever
truth
were
pregnant
by
circumstance
that
which
you
hear
youll
swear
you
see
there
is
such
unity
in
the
proofs
the
mantle
of
queen
hermione
her
jewel
about
the
neck
of
it
the
letters
of
antigonus
found
with
it
which
they
know
to
be
his
character
the
majesty
of
the
creature
in
resemblance
of
the
mother
the
affection
of
nobleness
which
nature
shows
above
her
breeding
and
many
other
evidences
proclaim
her
with
all
certainty
to
be
the
kings
daughter
did
you
see
the
meeting
of
the
two
kings
no
then
have
you
lost
a
sight
which
was
to
be
seen
cannot
be
spoken
of
there
might
you
have
beheld
one
joy
crown
another
so
and
in
such
manner
that
it
seemed
sorrow
wept
to
take
leave
of
them
for
their
joy
waded
in
tears
there
was
casting
up
of
eyes
holding
up
of
hands
with
countenances
of
such
distraction
that
they
were
to
be
known
by
garment
not
by
favour
our
king
being
ready
to
leap
out
of
himself
for
joy
of
his
found
daughter
as
if
that
joy
were
now
become
a
loss
cries
o
thy
mother
thy
mother
then
asks
bohemia
forgiveness
then
embraces
his
soninlaw
then
again
worries
he
his
daughter
with
clipping
her
now
he
thanks
the
old
shepherd
which
stands
by
like
a
weatherbitten
conduit
of
many
kings
reigns
i
never
heard
of
such
another
encounter
which
lames
report
to
follow
it
and
undoes
description
to
do
it
what
pray
you
became
of
antigonus
that
carried
hence
the
child
like
an
old
tale
still
which
will
have
matter
to
rehearse
though
credit
be
asleep
and
not
an
ear
open
he
was
torn
to
pieces
with
a
bear
this
avouches
the
shepherds
son
who
has
not
only
his
innocence
which
seems
much
to
justify
him
but
a
handkerchief
and
rings
of
his
that
paulina
knows
what
became
of
his
bark
and
his
followers
wracked
the
same
instant
of
their
masters
death
and
in
the
view
of
the
shepherd
so
that
all
the
instruments
which
aided
to
expose
the
child
were
even
then
lost
when
it
was
found
but
o
the
noble
combat
that
twixt
joy
and
sorrow
was
fought
in
paulina
she
had
one
eye
declined
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
another
elevated
that
the
oracle
was
fulfilled
she
lifted
the
princess
from
the
earth
and
so
locks
her
in
embracing
as
if
she
would
pin
her
to
her
heart
that
she
might
no
more
be
in
danger
of
losing
the
dignity
of
this
act
was
worth
the
audience
of
kings
and
princes
for
by
such
was
it
acted
one
of
the
prettiest
touches
of
all
and
that
which
angled
for
mine
eyes
caught
the
water
though
not
the
fish
was
when
at
the
relation
of
the
queens
death
with
the
manner
how
she
came
to
it
bravely
confessed
and
lamented
by
the
king
how
attentiveness
wounded
his
daughter
till
from
one
sign
of
dolour
to
another
she
did
with
an
alas
i
would
fain
say
bleed
tears
for
i
am
sure
my
heart
wept
blood
who
was
most
marble
there
changed
colour
some
swounded
all
sorrowed
if
all
the
world
could
have
seent
the
woe
had
been
universal
are
they
returned
to
the
court
no
the
princess
hearing
of
her
mothers
statue
which
is
in
the
keeping
of
paulina
a
piece
many
years
in
doing
and
now
newly
performed
by
that
rare
italian
master
julio
romano
who
had
he
himself
eternity
and
could
put
breath
into
his
work
would
beguile
nature
of
her
custom
so
perfectly
he
is
her
ape
he
so
near
to
hermione
hath
done
hermione
that
they
say
one
would
speak
to
her
and
stand
in
hope
of
answer
thither
with
all
greediness
of
affection
are
they
gone
and
there
they
intend
to
sup
i
thought
she
had
some
great
matter
there
in
hand
for
she
hath
privately
twice
or
thrice
a
day
ever
since
the
death
of
hermione
visited
that
removed
house
shall
we
thither
and
with
our
company
piece
the
rejoicing
who
would
be
thence
that
has
the
benefit
of
access
every
wink
of
an
eye
some
new
grace
will
be
born
our
absence
makes
us
unthrifty
to
our
knowledge
lets
along
now
had
i
not
the
dash
of
my
former
life
in
me
would
preferment
drop
on
my
head
i
brought
the
old
man
and
his
son
aboard
the
prince
told
him
i
heard
them
talk
of
a
fardel
and
i
know
not
what
but
he
at
that
time
overfond
of
the
shepherds
daughter
so
he
then
took
her
to
be
who
began
to
be
much
seasick
and
himself
little
better
extremity
of
weather
continuing
this
mystery
remained
undiscovered
but
tis
all
one
to
me
for
had
i
been
the
finder
out
of
this
secret
it
would
not
have
relished
among
my
other
discredits
here
come
those
i
have
done
good
to
against
my
will
and
already
appearing
in
the
blossoms
of
their
fortune
come

am
past
moe

but
thy
sons
and
daughters
will
be
all
gentlemen
born

me

other
day

two
kings
called
my
father
brother
and
then
the
prince
my
brother
and
the
princess
my
sister
called
my
father

and

the
first
gentlemanlike
tears

shed

may
live

shed
many
more

faults

a
tall
fellow
trust
me
not
hark
the
kings
and
the
princes
our
kindred
are
going
to
see
the
queens
picture
come
follow
us
well
be
thy
good
masters
o
grave
and
good
paulina
the
great
comfort
that
i
have
had
of
thee
what
sovereign
sir
i
did
not
well
i
meant
well
all
my
services
you
have
paid
home
but
that
you
have
vouchsafd
with
your
crownd
brother
and
these
your
contracted
heirs
of
your
kingdoms
my
poor
house
to
visit
it
is
a
surplus
of
your
grace
which
never
my
life
may
last
to
answer
o
paulina
we
honour
you
with
trouble
but
we
came
to
see
the
statue
of
our
queen
your
gallery
have
we
passd
through
not
without
much
content
in
many
singularities
but
we
saw
not
that
which
my
daughter
came
to
look
upon
the
statue
of
her
mother
as
she
livd
peerless
so
her
dead
likeness
i
do
well
believe
excels
whatever
yet
you
lookd
upon
or
hand
of
man
hath
done
therefore
i
keep
it
lonely
apart
but
here
it
is
prepare
to
see
the
life
as
lively
mockd
as
ever
still
sleep
mockd
death
behold
and
say
tis
well
i
like
your
silence
it
the
more
shows
off
your
wonder
but
yet
speak
first
you
my
liege
comes
it
not
something
near
her
natural
posture
chide
me
dear
stone
that
i
may
say
indeed
thou
art
hermione
or
rather
thou
art
she
in
thy
not
chiding
for
she
was
as
tender
as
infancy
and
grace
but
yet
paulina
hermione
was
not
so
much
wrinkled
nothing
so
aged
as
this
seems
o
not
by
much
so
much
the
more
our
carvers
excellence
which
lets
go
by
some
sixteen
years
and
makes
her
as
she
livd
now
as
now
she
might
have
done
so
much
to
my
good
comfort
as
it
is
now
piercing
to
my
soul
o
thus
she
stood
even
with
such
life
of
majesty
warm
life
as
now
it
coldly
stands
when
first
i
wood
her
i
am
ashamd
does
not
the
stone
rebuke
me
for
being
more
stone
than
it
o
royal
piece
theres
magic
in
thy
majesty
which
has
my
evils
conjurd
to
remembrance
and
from
thy
admiring
daughter
took
the
spirits
standing
like
stone
with
thee
and
give
me
leave
and
do
not
say
tis
superstition
that
i
kneel
and
then
implore
her
blessing
lady
dear
queen
that
ended
when
i
but
began
give
me
that
hand
of
yours
to
kiss
o
patience
the
statue
is
but
newly
fixd
the
colours
not
dry
my
lord
your
sorrow
was
too
sore
laid
on
which
sixteen
winters
cannot
blow
away
so
many
summers
dry
scarce
any
joy
did
ever
so
long
live
no
sorrow
but
killd
itself
much
sooner
dear
my
brother
let
him
that
was
the
cause
of
this
have
power
to
take
off
so
much
grief
from
you
as
he
will
piece
up
in
himself
indeed
my
lord
if
i
had
thought
the
sight
of
my
poor
image
would
thus
have
wrought
you
for
the
stone
is
mine
id
not
have
showd
it
do
not
draw
the
curtain
no
longer
shall
you
gaze
ont
lest
your
fancy
may
think
anon
it
moves
let
be
let
be
would
i
were
dead
but
that
methinks
already
what
was
he
that
did
make
it
see
my
lord
would
you
not
deem
it
breathd
and
that
those
veins
did
verily
bear
blood
masterly
done
the
very
life
seems
warm
upon
her
lip
the
fixure
of
her
eye
has
motion
int
as
we
are
mockd
with
art
ill
draw
the
curtain
my
lords
almost
so
far
transported
that
hell
think
anon
it
lives
o
sweet
paulina
make
me
to
think
so
twenty
years
together
no
settled
senses
of
the
world
can
match
the
pleasure
of
that
madness
lett
alone
i
am
sorry
sir
i
have
thus
far
stirrd
you
but
i
could
afflict
you
further
do
paulina
for
this
affliction
has
a
taste
as
sweet
as
any
cordial
comfort
still
methinks
there
is
an
air
comes
from
her
what
fine
chisel
could
ever
yet
cut
breath
let
no
man
mock
me
for
i
will
kiss
her
good
my
lord
forbear
the
ruddiness
upon
her
lip
is
wet
youll
mar
it
if
you
kiss
it
stain
your
own
with
oily
painting
shall
i
draw
the
curtain
no
not
these
twenty
years
so
long
could
i
stand
by
a
lookeron
either
forbear
quit
presently
the
chapel
or
resolve
you
for
more
amazement
if
you
can
behold
it
ill
make
the
statue
move
indeed
descend
and
take
you
by
the
hand
but
then
youll
think
which
i
protest
against
i
am
assisted
by
wicked
powers
what
you
can
make
her
do
i
am
content
to
look
on
what
to
speak
i
am
content
to
hear
for
tis
as
easy
to
make
her
speak
as
move
it
is
requird
you
do
awake
your
faith
then
all
stand
still
or
those
that
think
it
is
unlawful
business
i
am
about
let
them
depart
proceed
no
foot
shall
stir
music
awake
her
strike
tis
time
descend
be
stone
no
more
approach
strike
all
that
look
upon
with
marvel
come
ill
fill
your
grave
up
stir
nay
come
away
bequeath
to
death
your
numbness
for

good
paulina
lead
us
from
hence
where
we
may
leisurely
each
one
demand
and
answer
to
his
part
performd
in
this
wide
gap
of
time
since
first
we
were
disseverd
hastily
lead
away
troilus
and
cressida
in
troy
there
lies
the
scene
from
isles
of
greece
the
princes
orgulous
their
high
blood
chafd
have
to
the
port
of
athens
sent
their
ships
fraught
with
the
ministers
and
instruments
of
cruel
war
sixty
and
nine
that
wore
their
crownets
regal
from
the
athenian
bay
put
forth
toward
phrygia
and
their
vow
is
made
to
ransack
troy
within
whose
strong
immures
the
ravishd
helen
menelaus
queen
with
wanton
paris
sleeps
and
thats
the
quarrel
to
tenedos
they
come
and
the
deepdrawing
barks
do
there
disgorge
their
warlike
fraughtage
now
on
dardan
plains
the
fresh
and
yet
unbruised
greeks
do
pitch
their
brave
pavilions
priams
sixgated

dardan
and
tymbria
ilias
chetas
trojan
and
antenorides
with
massy

the

of
troy
now
expectation
tickling
skittish
spirits
on
one
and
other
side
trojan
and
greek
sets
all
on
hazard
and
hither
am
i
come
a
prologue
armd
but
not
in
confidence
of
authors
pen
or
actors
voice
but
suited
in
like
conditions
as
our
argument
to
tell
you
fair
beholders
that
our
play
leaps
oer
the
vaunt
and
firstlings
of
those
broils
beginning
in
the
middle
starting
thence
away
to
what
may
be
digested
in
a
play
like
or
find
fault
do
as
your
pleasures
are
now
good
or
bad
tis
but
the
chance
of
war
call
here
my
varlet
ill
unarm
again
why
should
i
war
without
the
walls
of
troy
that
find
such
cruel
battle
here
within
each
trojan
that
is
master
of
his
heart
let
him
to
field
troilus
alas
has
none
will
this
gear
neer
be
mended
the
greeks
are
strong
and
skilful
to
their
strength
fierce
to
their
skill
and
to
their
fierceness
valiant
but
i
am
weaker
than
a
womans
tear
tamer
than
sleep
fonder
than
ignorance
less
valiant
than
the
virgin
in
the
night
and
skilless
as
unpractisd
infancy
well
i
have
told
you
enough
of
this
for
my
part
ill
not
meddle
nor
make
no
further
he
that
will
have
a
cake
out
of
the
wheat
must
tarry
the
grinding
have
i
not
tarried
ay
the
grinding
but
you
must
tarry
the

have
i
not
tarried
ay
the
bolting
but
you
must
tarry
the
leavening
still
have
i
tarried
ay
to
the

but
heres
yet
in
the
word
hereafter
the
kneading
the
making
of
the
cake
the
heating
of
the
oven
and
the
baking
nay
you
must
stay
the
cooling
too
or
you
may
chance
to
burn
your
lips
patience
herself
what
goddess
eer
she
be
doth
lesser
blench
at
sufferance
than
i
do
at
priams
royal
table
do
i
sit
and
when
fair
cressid
comes
into
my
thoughts
so
traitor
when
she
comes
when
is
she
thence
well
she
looked
yesternight
fairer
than
ever
i
saw
her
look
or
any
woman
else
i
was
about
to
tell
thee
when
my
heart
as
wedged
with
a
sigh
would
rive
in
twain
lest
hector
or
my
father
should
perceive
me
i
have
as
when
the
sun
doth
light
a
storm
buried
this
sigh
in
wrinkle
of
a
smile
but
sorrow
that
is
couchd
in
seeming
gladness
is
like
that
mirth
fate
turns
to
sudden
sadness
an
her
hair
were
not
somewhat
darker
than
helens
well
go
to
there
were
no
more
comparison
between
the
women
but
for
my
part
she
is
my
kins
woman
i
would
not
as
they
term
it
praise
her
but
i
would
somebody
had
heard
her
talk
yesterday
as
i
did
i
will
not
dispraise
your
sister
cassandras
wit
but
o
pandarus
i
tell
thee
pandarus
when
i
do
tell
thee
there
my
hopes
lie
drownd
reply
not
in
how
many
fathoms
deep
they
lie
indrenchd
i
tell
thee
i
am
mad
in
cressids

fair
pourst
in
the
open
ulcer
of
my
heart
her
eyes
her
hair
her
cheek
her
gait
her
voice
handlest
in
thy
discourse
o
that
her
hand
in
whose
comparison
all
whites
are
ink
writing
their
own
reproach
to
whose
soft
seizure
the
cygnets
down
is
harsh
and
spirit
of
sense
hard
as
the
palm
of
ploughman
this
thou
tellst
me
as
true
thou
tellst
me
when
i
say
i
love
her
but
saying
thus
instead
of
oil
and
balm
thou
layst
in
every
gash
that
love
hath
given
me
the
knife
that
made
it
i
speak
no
more
than
truth
thou
dost
not
speak
so
much
faith
ill
not
meddle
int
let
her
be
as
she
is
if
she
be
fair
tis
the
better
for
her
an
she
be
not
she
has
the
mends
in
her
own
hands
good
pandarus
how
now

i
have
had
my
labour
for
my
travail
illthought
on
of
her
and

between
and
between
but
small
thanks
for
my
labour
what
art
thou
angry
pandarus
what
with
me
because
shes
kin
to
me
therefore

kin
to
me

would
be
as
fair

friday
as

your
blood
you
daily
paint
her
thus
i
cannot
fight
upon
this
argument
it
is
too
starvd
a
subject
for
my
sword
but
pandarus
o
gods
how
do
you
plague
me
i
cannot
come
to
cressid
but

this
womans
answer

from
the
field
today
that
paris
is
returned
home
and
hurt
by
whom
neas
troilus
by
menelaus
let
paris
bleed
tis
but
a
scar
to
scorn
paris
is
gord
with
menelaus
horn
hark
what
good
sport
is
out
of
town
today
better
at
home
if
would
i
might
were
may
but
to
the
sport
abroad
are
you
bound
thither
in
all
swift
haste
come
go
we
then
together
who
were
those
went
by
queen
hecuba
and
helen
and
whither
go
they
up
to
the
eastern
tower
whose
height
commands
as
subject
all
the
vale
to
see
the
battle
hector
whose
patience
is
as
a
virtue
fixd
today
was
movd
he
chid
andromache
and
struck
his
armourer
and
like
as
there
were
husbandry
in
war
before
the
sun
rose
he
was
harnessd
light
and
to
the
field
goes
he
where
every
flower
did
as
a
prophet
weep
what
it
foresaw
in
hectors
wrath
what
was
his
cause
of
anger
the
noise
goes
this
there
is
among
the
greeks
a
lord
of
trojan
blood
nephew
to
hector
they
call
him
ajax
good
and
what
of
him
they
say
he
is
a
very
man
per
se
and
stands
alone
so
do
all
men
unless
they
are
drunk
sick
or
have
no
legs
this
man
lady
hath
robbed
many
beasts
of
their
particular
additions
he
is
as
valiant
as
the
lion
churlish
as
the
bear
slow
as
the
elephant
a
man
into
whom
nature
hath
so
crowded
humours
that
his
valour
is
crushed
into
folly
his
folly
sauced
with
discretion
there
is
no
man
hath
a
virtue
that
he
hath
not
a
glimpse
of
nor
any
man
an
attaint
but
he
carries
some
stain
of
it
he
is
melancholy
without
cause
and
merry
against
the
hair
he
hath
the
joints
of
every
thing
but
every
thing
so
out
of
joint
that
he
is
a
gouty
briareus
many
hands
and
no
use
or
purblind
argus
all
eyes
and
no
sight
but
how
should
this
man
that
makes
me
smile
make
hector
angry
they
say
he
yesterday
coped
hector
in
the
battle
and
struck
him
down
the
disdain
and
shame
whereof
hath
ever
since
kept
hector
fasting
and
waking
who
comes

stirring
early

his
anger

cause

about
him
today

can
tell
them

and
theres
troilus
will
not
come
far
behind

let
them
take
heed
of
troilus
i
can
tell
them
that
too
what
is
he
angry
too
who
troilus
troilus
is
the
better
man
of
the
two
o
jupiter
theres
no
comparison
what
not
between
troilus
and
hector
do
you
know
a
man
if
you
see
him
ay
if
i
ever
saw
him
before
and
knew
him
well
i
say
troilus
is
troilus
then
you
say
as
i
say
for
i
am
sure
he
is
not
hector
no
nor
hector
is
not
troilus
in
some
degrees
tis
just
to
each
of
them
he
is
himself
himself
alas
poor
troilus
i
would
he
were
so
he
is
condition
i
had
gone
barefoot
to
india
he
is
not
hector
himself
no
hes
not
himself
would
a
were
himself
well
the
gods
are
above
time
must
friend
or
end
well
troilus
well
i
would
my
heart
were
in
her
body
no
hector
is
not
a
better
man
than
troilus
excuse
me
he
is
elder
pardon
me
pardon
me
th
others
not
come
tot
you
shall
tell
me
another
tale
when
the
others
come
tot
hector
shall
not
have
his
wit
this
year
he
shall
not
need
it
if
he
have
his
own
nor
his
qualities
no
matter
nor
his
beauty
twould
not
become
him
his
owns
better
you
have
no
judgment
niece
helen
herself
swore
th
other
day
that
troilus
for
a
brown
favour
for
so
tis
i
must
confess
not
brown
neither
no
but
brown
faith
to
say
truth
brown
and
not
brown
to
say
the
truth
true
and
not
true
she
praisd
his
complexion
above
paris
why
paris
hath
colour
enough
so
he
has
then
troilus
should
have
too
much
if
she
praised
him
above
his
complexion
is
higher
than
his
he
having
colour
enough
and
the
other
higher
is
too
flaming
a
praise
for
a
good
complexion
i
had
as
lief
helens
golden
tongue
had
commended
troilus
for
a
copper
nose
i
swear
to
you
i
think
helen
loves
him
better
than
paris
then
shes
a
merry
greek
indeed
nay
i
am
sure
she
does
she
came
to
him
th
other
day
into
the
compassed
window
and
you
know
he
has
not
past
three
or
four
hairs
on
his
chin
indeed
a
tapsters
arithmetic
may
soon
bring
his
particulars
therein
to
a
total
why
he
is
very
young
and
yet
will
he
within
three
pound
lift
as
much
as
his
brother
hector
is
he
so
young
a
man
and
so
old
a
lifter
but
to
prove
to
you
that
helen
loves
him
she
came
and
puts
me
her
white
hand
to
his
cloven
chin
juno
have
mercy
how
came
it
cloven
why
you
know
tis
dimpled
i
think
his
smiling
becomes
him
better
than
any
man
in
all
phrygia
o
he
smiles
valiantly
does
he
not
o
yes
an
twere
a
cloud
in
autumn
why
go
to
then
but
to
prove
to
you
that
helen
loves
troilus
troilus
will
stand
to
the
proof
if
youll
prove
it
so
troilus
why
he
esteems
her
no
more
than
i
esteem
an
addle
egg
if
you
love
an
addle
egg
as
well
as
you
love
an
idle
head
you
would
eat
chickens
i
the
shell
i
cannot
choose
but
laugh
to
think
how
she
tickled
his
chin
indeed
she
has
a
marvells
white
hand
i
must
needs
confess
without
the
rack
and
she
takes
upon
her
to
spy
a
white
hair
on
his
chin
alas
poor
chin
many
a
wart
is
richer
but
there
was
such
laughing
queen
hecuba
laughed
that
her
eyes
ran
oer
with
millstones
and
cassandra
laughed
but
there
was
more
temperate
fire
under
the
pot
of
her
eyes
did
her
eyes
run
oer
too
and
hector

i

nay
ill
watch
you
for

and
thats
one
of
the
chiefest
of

too
if

what
i
would
not

i
can
watch
you
for
telling
how
i
took
the
blow
unless
it
swell
past

and
then
its
past
watching
you
are
such
another
sir
my

instantly
speak
with

where
at
your

there
he
unarms
him
good

tell

i
come
i
doubt
he
be
hurt
fare
ye
well
good
niece
adieu
uncle
ill
be
with
you

by
to
bring

ay
a

the
same
token
you
are
a
bawd
words
vows
gifts
tears
and
loves
full
sacrifice
he
offers
in
anothers
enterprise
but
more
in
troilus
thousandfold
i
see
than
in
the
glass
of
pandars
praise
may
be
yet
hold
i
off
women
are
angels
wooing
things
won

in
the
doing
that
she
belovd

that

not
this

prize
the

more
than
it
is
that
she
was
never

that
ever

so
sweet
as
when

therefore
this
maxim
out

then
though
my

doth
bear
nothing

from

what
grief
hath
set
the

on
your

the
ample
proposition
that

all

on

and
divert

tortive

from
his

of

nor
princes
is
it
matter
new
to
us
that
we
come
short
of
our
suppose
so
far
that
after
seven
years
siege
yet
troy
walls
stand
sith
every
action
that
hath
gone
before
whereof
we
have
record

did
draw

not

that

figure
of

why
then
you
princes
do
you
with
cheeks
abashd
behold
our
works
and
call
them
shames
which
are
indeed
nought
else
but
the
protractive
trials
of
great
jove
to
find
persistive
constancy
in

the
fineness
of
which

is
not
found

in
the

tempest
of

with
a
broad
and
powerful
fan
puffing
at
all
winnows
the
light
away
and
what
hath

by
itself
lies
rich
in
virtue
and
unmingled
with
due
observance
of
thy
godlike
seat
great
agamemnon
nestor
shall
apply
thy
latest
words
in
the
reproof
of
chance
lies
the
true
proof
of
men
the
sea
being
smooth
how
many
shallow
bauble
boats
dare
sail
upon
her
patient
breast
making
their
way
with
those
of
nobler
bulk
but
let
the
ruffian
boreas
once
enrage
the
gentle
thetis
and
anon
behold
the
strongribbd
bark
through
liquid
mountains
cut
bounding
between
the
two
moist
elements
like
perseus
horse
wheres
then
the
saucy
boat
whose
weak
untimberd
sides
but
even
now
corivalld
greatness
either
to
harbour
fled
or
made
a
toast
for
neptune
even
so
doth
valours
show
and
valours
worth
divide
in
storms
of
fortune
for
in
her
ray
and
brightness
the
herd
hath
more
annoyance
by
the
breese
than
by
the
tiger
but
when
the
splitting
wind
makes
flexible
the
knees
of
knotted
oaks
and
flies
fled
under
shade
why
then
the
thing
of
courage
as
rousd
with
rage
with
rage
doth
sympathize
and
with
an
accent
tund
in
selfsame
key
retorts
to
chiding
fortune
agamemnon
thou
great

bone
of
greece

of
our
numbers
soul
and
only
spirit
in
whom
the
tempers

besides
the
applause
and
approbation
the

most
mighty

thy
place
and
sway
and
thou
most
reverend
for
thy
stretchdout
life
i
give
to
both
your
speeches
which
were
such
as
agamemnon
and
the
hand
of
greece
should
hold
up
high
in
brass
and
such
again
as
venerable
nestor
hatchd
in
silver
should
with
a
bond
of

strong
as
the
axletree
on
which
heaven

knit
all
the

to

let
it

hoth
thou

speak
prince

needless
of
importless

divide
thy

than
we
are
confident
when
rank

his

we
shall
hear
music
wit
and
oracle
troy
yet
upon
his
basis
had
been
down
and
the
great
hectors
sword
had
lackd
a
master
but
for
these
instances
the
specialty
of
rule
hath
been
neglected
and
look
how
many
grecian
tents
do
stand
hollow
upon
this
plain
so
many
hollow
factions
when
that
the
general
is
not
like
the
hive
to
whom
the
foragers
shall
all
repair
what
honey
is
expected
degree

vizarded
the
unworthiest

and
therefore

the

eminence
enthrond

spherd
amidst
the

whose
medcinable
eye
corrects
the
ill
aspects
of

evil

like
the

of

sans

when
the

in

to

wander
what

what

the

higher

rather
right

wrong
between

endless

should

so

justice

then
every

in

power
into

will
into
appetite
and
appetite
a
universal
wolf
so
doubly
seconded
with

must
make
perforce
a
universal
prey
and
last
eat
up
himself
great
agamemnon
this
chaos
when
degree
is
suffocate
follows
the
choking

this
neglection
of

it
is
that
by
a
pace
goes
backward
with
a
purpose
it
hath
to
climb
the
generals
disdaind
by

one
step
below
he
by
the
next
that
next
by
him
beneath
so
every
step
exampled
by
the
first
pace
that
is
sick
of
his
superior
grows
to
an
envious
fever
of
pale
and
bloodless
emulation
and
tis
this
fever
that
keeps
troy
on
foot
not
her
own
sinews
to
end
a
tale
of

troy
in
our
weakness
lives
not
in
her
strength
most
wisely
hath
ulysses
here
discoverd
the
fever
whereof
all
our
power
is
sick
the
nature
of
the
sickness
found
ulysses
what
is
the
remedy
the
great
achilles
whom
opinion
crowns
the
sinew
and
the
forehand
of
our
host
having
his
ear
full
of
his
airy
fame
grows
dainty
of
his
worth
and
in
his
tent
lies
mocking
our
designs
with
him
patroclus
upon
a
lazy
bed
the
livelong
day
breaks
scurril
jests

with
ridiculous
and
awkward
action
which
slanderer
he
imitation
calls
he
pageants
us
sometime
great
agamemnon
thy
topless
deputation
he
puts
on
and
like
a
strutting
player
whose
conceit
lies
in
his
hamstring
and
doth
think
it
rich
to
hear
the
wooden
dialogue
and
sound
twixt
his
stretchd
footing
and
the
scaffoldage
such
tobepitied
and
oerwrested
seeming
he
acts
thy
greatness
in
and
when
he
speaks
tis
like
a
chime
a
mending
with
terms
unsquard
which
from
the
tongue
of
roaring
typhon
droppd
would
seem
hyperboles
at
this
fusty
stuff
the
large
achilles
on
his

bed
lolling
from
his

chest
laughs
out
a
loud
applause
cries
excellent
tis
agamemnon
just
now
play
me
nestor
hem
and
stroke
thy

as
he
being
drest
to
some
oration
thats
done
as
near

play
him
me
patroclus
arming

alarm
and
then
forsooth
the
faint

of

be
the
scene
of
mirth
to
cough

with

shall
be
spoke
aloud
we
have
great
agamemnon
here
in
troy
a
prince
called
hector
priam
is
his
father
who
in
this
dull
and
longcontinud
truce
is
rusty
grown
he
bade
me
take
a
trumpet
and
to
this
purpose
speak
kings
princes
lords
if
there
be
one
among
the
fairst
of
greece
that
holds
his
honour
higher
than
his
ease
that
seeks
his
praise
more
than
he
fears
his
peril
that
knows
his
valour
and
knows
not
his
fear
that
loves
his
mistress
more
than
in
confession
with
truant
vows
to
her
own
lips
he
loves
and
dare
avow
her
beauty
and
her
worth
in
other
arms
than
hers
to
him
this
challenge
hector
in
view
of
trojans
and
of
greeks
shall
make
it
good
or
do
his
best
to
do
it
he
hath
a
lady
wiser
fairer
truer
than
ever
greek
did
compass
in
his
arms
and
will
tomorrow
with
his
trumpet
call
midway
between
your
tents
and
walls
of
troy
to
rouse
a
grecian
that
is
true
in
love
if
any
come
hector
shall
honour
him
if
none
hell
say
in
troy
when
he
retires
the
grecian
dames
are
sunburnt
and
not
worth
the
splinter
of
a
lance
even
so
much
this
shall
be
told
our
lovers
lord
neas
if
none
of
them
have
soul
in
such
a
kind
we
left
them
all
at
home
but
we
are
soldiers
and
may
that
soldier
a
mere
recreant
prove
that
means
not
hath
not
or
is
not
in
love
if
then
one
is
or
hath
or
means
to
be
that
one
meets
hector
if
none
else
i
am
he
tell
him
of
nestor
one
that
was
a
man
when
hectors
grandsire
suckd
he
is
old
now
but
if
there
be
not
in
our
grecian
host
one
noble
man
that
hath
one
spark
of
fire
to
answer
for
his
love
tell
him
from
me
ill
hide
my
silver
beard
in
a
gold
beaver
and
in
my
vantbrace
put
this
witherd
brawn
and
meeting
him
will
tell
him
that
my
lady
was
fairer
than
his
grandam
and
as
chaste
as
may
be
in
the
world
his
youth
in
flood
ill
prove
this
truth
with
my
three
drops
of
blood
now
heavens
forbid
such
scarcity
of
youth
amen
fair
lord
neas
let
me
touch
your
hand
to
our
pavilion
shall
i
lead
you
first
achilles
shall
have
word
of
this
intent
so
shall
each
lord
of
greece
from
tent
to
tent
yourself
shall
feast
with
us
before
you
go
and
find
the
welcome
of
a
noble
foe
nestor
what
says
ulysses
i
have
a
young
conception
in
my
brain
be
you
my
time
to
bring
it
to
some
shape
what
ist
this
tis
blunt
wedges
rive
hard
knots
the
seeded
pride
that
hath
to
this
maturity
blown
up
in
rank
achilles
must
or
now
be
croppd
or
shedding
breed
a
nursery
of
like
evil
to
overbulk
us
all
well
and
how
this
challenge
that
the
gallant
hector
sends
however
it
is
spread
in
general
name
relates
in
purpose
only
to
achilles
the
purpose
is
perspicuous
even
as
substance
whose
grossness
little
characters
sum
up
and
in
the
publication
make
no
strain
but
that
achilles
were
his
brain
as
barren
as
banks
of
libya
though
apollo
knows
tis
dry
enough
will
with
great
speed
of
judgment
ay
with
celerity
find
hectors
purpose
pointing
on
him
and
wake
him
to
the
answer
think
you
yes
tis
most
meet
whom
may
you
else
oppose
that
can
from
hector
bring
those
honours
off
if
not
achilles
thought
be
a
sportful
combat
yet
in
the
trial
much
opinion
dwells
for
here
the
trojans
taste
our
dearst
repute
with
their
finst
palate
and
trust
to
me
ulysses
our
imputation
shall
be
oddly
poisd
in
this
wild
action
for
the
success
although
particular
shall
give
a
scantling
of
good
or
bad
unto
the
general
and
in
such
indexes
although
small
pricks
to
their
subsequent
volumes
there
is
seen
the
baby
figure
of
the
giant
mass
of
things
to
come
at
large
it
is
supposd
he
that
meets
hector
issues
from
our
choice
and
choice
being
mutual
act
of
all
our
souls
makes
merit
her
election
and
doth
boil
as
twere
from
forth
us
all
a
man
distilld
out
of
our
virtues
who
miscarrying
what
heart
receives
from
bence
the
conquering
part
to
steel
a
strong
opinion
to
themselves
which
entertaind
limbs
are
his
instruments
in
no
less
working
than
are
swords
and
bows
directive
by
the
limbs
give
pardon
to
my
speech
therefore
tis
meet
achilles
meet
not
hector
let
us
like
merchants
show
our
foulest
wares
and
think
perchance
theyll
sell
if
not
the
lustre
of
the
better
yet
to
show
shall
show
the
better
do
not
consent
that
ever
hector
and
achilles
meet
for
both
our
honour
and
our
shame
in
this
are
doggd
with
two
strange
followers
i
see
them
not
with
my
old
eyes
what
are
they
what
glory
our
achilles
shares
from
hector
were
he
not
proud
we
all
should
share
with
him
but
he
already
is
too
insolent
and
we
were
better
parch
in
afric
sun
than
in
the
pride
and
salt
scorn
of
his
eyes
should
he
scape
hector
fair
if
he
were
foild
why
then
we
did
our
main
opinion
crush
in
taint
of
our
best
man
no
make
a
lottery
and
by
device
let
blockish
ajax
draw
the
sort
to
fight
with
hector
among
ourselves
give
him
allowance
as
the
worthier
man
for
that
will
physic
the
great
myrmidon
who
broils
in
loud
applause
and
make
him
fall
his
crest
that
prouder
than
blue
iris
bends
if
the
dull
brainless
ajax
come
safe
off
well
dress
him
up
in
voices
if
he
fail
yet
go
we
under
our
opinion
still
that
we
have
better
men
but
hit
or
miss
our
projects
life
this
shape
of
sense
assumes
ajax
employd
plucks
down
achilles
plumes
ulysses
now
i
begin
to
relish
thy
advice
and
i
will
give
a
taste
of
it
forthwith
to
agamemnon
go
we
to
him
straight
two
curs
shall
tame
each
other
pride
alone
must
tarre
the
mastiffs
on
as
twere
their
bone
thersites
agamemnon
how
if
he
had
boils
full
all
over
generally
thersites
and
those
boils
did
run
say
so
did
not
the
general
run
then

the

thou
art

every

denies
the

my

weigh
you
the
worth
and
honour
of
a
king
so
great
as
our
dread
father
in
a
scale
of
common
ounces
will
you
with
counters
sum
the
past
proportion
of
his
infinite
and
buckle
in

most
fathomless

no

you

you

so
empty

should
not
our

bear
the

you

is
perilous

object
of
all
harm
who
marvels
then
when
helenus
beholds
a
grecian
and
his
sword
if
he

wings
of
reason
to
his
heels
and
fly
like

if

lets
shut

no

can

we

such

no

doth
form

deject

hath
our

all
engagd
to

gracious
for
my

i
am
no
more
touchd
than
all
priams

and
jove
forbid
there
should
be
done
amongst
us
such
things
as
might
offend
the
weakest
spleen
to
fight
for
and
maintain
else
might
the
world
convince
of
levity
as
well
my
undertakings
as
your
counsels
but
i
attest
the
gods
your
full
consent
gave
wings
to
my
propension
and
cut
off
all
fears
attending
on
so
dire
a
project
for
what
alas
can
these
my
single
arms
what
propugnation
is
in
one
mans
valour
to
stand
the
push
and
enmity
of
those
this
quarrel
would
excite
yet
i
protest
were
i
alone
to
pass
the
difficulties
and
had
as
ample
power
as
i
have
will
paris
should
neer
retract
what
he
hath
done
nor
faint
in
the
pursuit
paris
you
speak
like
one
besotted
on
your
sweet
delights
you
have
the
honey
still
but
these
the
gall
so
to
be
valiant
is
no
praise
at
all
sir
i
propose
not
merely
to
myself
the
pleasure
such
a
beauty
brings
with
it
but
i
would
have
the
soil
of
her
fair
rape
wipd
off
in
honourable
keeping
her
what
treason
were
it
to
the
ransackd
queen
disgrace
to
your
great
worths
and
shame
to
me
now
to
deliver
her
possession
up
on
terms
of
base
compulsion
can
it
be
that
so
degenerate
a
strain
as
this
should
once
set
footing
in
your
generous
bosoms
theres
not
the
meanest
spirit
on
our
party
without
a
heart
to
dare
or
sword
to
draw
when
helen
is
defended
nor
none
so
noble
whose
life
were
ill
bestowd
or
death
unfamd
where
helen
is
the
subject
then
i
say
well
may
we
fight
for
her
whom
we
know
well
the
worlds
large
spaces
cannot
parallel
paris
and
troilus
you
have
both
said
well
and
on
the
cause
and
question
now
in
hand
have
glozd
but
superficially
not
much
unlike
young
men
whom
aristotle
thought
unfit
to
hear
moral
philosophy
the
reasons
you
allege
do
more
conduce
to
the
hot
passion
of
distemperd
blood
than
to
make
up
a
free
determination
twixt
right
and
wrong
for
pleasure
and
revenge
have
ears
more
deaf
than
adders
to
the
voice
of
any
true
decision
nature
craves
all
dues
be
renderd
to
their
owners
now
what
nearer
debt
in
all
humanity
than
wife
is
to
the
husband
if
this
law
of
nature
be
corrupted
through
affection
and
that
great
minds
of
partial
indulgence
to
their
benumbed
wills
resist
the
saine
there
is
a
law
in
each
wellorderd
nation
to
curb
those
raging
appetites
that
are
most
disobedient
and
refractory
if
helen
then
be
wife
to
spartas
king
as
it
is
known
she
is
these
moral
laws
of
nature
and
of
nations
speak
aloud
to
have
her
back
returnd
thus
to
persist
in
doing
wrong
extenuates
not
wrong
but
makes
it
much
more
heavy
hectors
opinion
is
this
in
way
of
truth
yet
neertheless
my
spritely
brethren
i
propend
to
you
in
resolution
to
keep
helen
still
for
tis
a
cause
that
hath
no
mean
dependance
upon
our
joint
and
several
dignities
why
there
you
touchd
the
life
of
our
design
were
it
not
glory
that
we
more
affected
than
the
performance
of
our
heaving
spleens
i
would
not
wish
a
drop
of
trojan
blood
spent
more
in
her
defence
but
worthy
hector
she
is
a
theme
of
honour
and
renown
a
spur
to
valiant
and
magnanimous
deeds
whose
present
courage
may
beat
down
our
foes
and
fame
in
time
to
come
canonize
us
for
i
presume
brave
hector
would
not
lose
so
rich
advantage
of
a
promisd
glory
as
smiles
upon
the
forehead
of
this
action
for
the
wide
worlds
revenue
i
am
yours
you
valiant
offspring
of
great
priamus
i
have
a
roisting
challenge
sent
amongst
the
dull
and
factious
nobles
of
the
greeks
will
strike
amazement
to
their
drowsy
spirits
i
was
advertisd
their
great
general
slept
whilst
emulation
in
the
army
crept
this
i
presume
will
wake
him
how
now
thersites
what
lost
in
the
labyrinth
of
thy
fury
shall
the
elephant
ajax
carry
it
thus
he
beats
me
and
i
rail
at
him
o
worthy
satisfaction
would
it
were
otherwise
that
i
could
beat
him
whilst
he
railed
at
me
sfoot
ill
learn
to
conjure
and
raise
devils
but
ill
see
some
issue
of
my
spiteful
execrations
then
theres
achilles
a
rare
enginer
if
troy
be
not
taken
till
these
two
undermine
it
the
walls
will
stand
till
they
fall
of
themselves
o
thou
great
thunderdarter
of
olympus
forget
that
thou
art
jove
the
king
of
gods
and
mercury
lose
all
the
serpentine
craft
of
thy
caduceus
if
ye
take
not
that
little
little
less
than
little
wit
from
them
that
they
have
which
shortarmed
ignorance
itself
knows
is
so
abundant
scarce
it
will
not
in
circumvention
deliver
a
fly
from
a
spider
without
drawing
their
massy
irons
and
cutting
the
web
after
this
the
vengeance
on
the
whole
camp
or
rather
the
neapolitan
boneache
for
that
methinks
is
the
curse
dependant
on
those

with
me
thersites
here
is
such
patchery
such
juggling
and
such
knavery
all
the
argument
is
a
cuckold
and
a
whore
a
good
quarrel
to
draw
emulous
factions
and
bleed
to
death
upon
now
the
dry
serpigo
on
the
subject
and
war
and
lechery
confound
all
where
is
achilles
within
his
tent
but
illdisposd
my
lord
let
it
be
known
to
him
that
we
are
here
he
shent
our
messengers
and
we
lay
by
our
appertainments
visiting
of
him
let
him
be
told
so
lest
perchance
he
think
we
dare
not
move
the
question
of
our
place
or
know
not
what
we
are
i
shall
say
so
to
him
we
saw
him
at
the
opening
of
his
tent
he
is
not
sick
yes
lionsick
sick
of
proud
heart
you
may
call
it
melancholy
if
you
will
favour
the
man
but
by
my
head
tis
pride
but
why
why
let
him
show
us
a
cause
a
word
my
lord
what
moves
ajax
thus
to
bay
at
him
achilles
hath
inveigled
his
fool
from
him
who
thersites
he
then
will
ajax
lack
matter
if
he
have
lost
his
argument
no
you
see
he
is
his
argument
that
has
his
argument
achilles
all
the
better
their
fraction
is
more
our
wish
than
their
faction
but
it
was
a
strong
composure
a
fool
could
disunite
the
amity
that
wisdom
knits
not
folly
may
easily
untie
here
comes
patroclus
no
achilles
with
him
the
elephant
hath
joints
but
none
for
courtesy
his
legs
are
legs
for
necessity
not
for
flexure
achilles
bids
me
say
he
is
much
sorry
if
any
thing
more
than
your
sport
and
pleasure
did
move
your
greatness
and
this
noble
state
to
call
upon
him
he
hopes
it
is
no
other
but
for
your
health
and
your
digestion
sake
an
afterdinners
breath
hear
you
patroclus
we
are
too
well
acquainted
with
these
answers
but
his
evasion
wingd
thus
swift
with
scorn
cannot
outfly
our
apprehensions
much
attribute
he
hath
and
much
the
reason
why
we
ascribe
it
to
him
yet
all
his
virtues
not
virtuously
on
his
own
part
beheld
do
in
our
eyes
begin
to
lose
their
gloss
yea
like
fair
fruit
in
an
unwholesome
dish
are
like
to
rot
untasted
go
and
tell
him
we
come
to
speak
with
him
and
you
shall
not
sin
if
you
do
say
we
think
him
overproud
and
underhonest
in
selfassumption
greater
than
in
the
note
of
judgment
and
worthier
than
himself
here
tend
the
savage
strangeness
he
puts
on
disguise
the
holy
strength
of
their
command
and
underwrite
in
an
observing
kind
his
humorous
predominance
yea
watch
his
pettish
lunes
his
ebbs
his
flows
as
if
the
passage
and
whole
carriage
of
this
action
rode
on
his
tide
go
tell
him
this
and
add
that
if
he
overhold
his
price
so
much
well
none
of
him
but
let
him
like
an
engine
not
portable
lie
under
this
report
bring
action
hither
this
cannot
go
to
war
a
stirring
dwarf
we
do
allowance
give
before
a
sleeping
giant
tell
him
so
i
shall
and
bring
his
answer
presently
in
second
voice
well
not
be
satisfied
we
come
to
speak
with
him
ulysses
enter
you
what
is
he
more
than
another
no
more
than
what
he
thinks
he
is
is
he
so
much
do
you
not
think
he
thinks
himself
a
better
man
than
i
am
no
question
will
you
subscribe
his
thought
and
say
he
is
no
noble
ajax
you
are
as
strong
as
valiant
as
wise
no
less
noble
much
more
gentle
and
altogether
more
tractable
why
should
a
man
be
proud
how
doth
pride
grow
i
know
not
what
pride
is
your
mind
is
the
clearer
ajax
and
your
virtues
the
fairer
he
that
is
proud
eats
up
himself
pride
is
his
own
glass
his
own
trumpet
his
own
chronicle
and
whatever
praises
itself
but
in
the
deed
devours
the
deed
in
the
praise
i
do
hate
a
proud
man
as
i
hate
the
engendering
of
toads
yet
he
loves
himself
ist
not
strange
achilles
will
not
to
the
field
tomorrow
whats
his
excuse
he
doth
rely
on
none
but
carries
on
the
stream
of
his
dispose
without
observance
or
respect
of
any
in
will
peculiar
and
in
selfadmission
why
will
he
not
upon
our
fair
request
untent
his
person
and
share
the
air
with
us
things
small
as
nothing
for
requests
sake
only
he
makes
important
possessd
he
is
with
greatness
and
speaks
not
to
himself
but
with
a
pride
that
quarrels
at
selfbreath
imagind
worth
holds
in
his
blood
such
swoln
and
hot
discourse
that
twixt
his
mental
and
his
active
parts
kingdomd
achilles
in
commotion
rages
and
batters
down
himself
what
should
i
say
he
is
so
plaguy
proud
that
the
deathtokens
of
it
cry
no
recovery
let
ajax
go
to
him
dear
lord
go
you
and
meet
him
in
his
tent
tis
said
he
holds
you
well
and
will
be
led
at
your
request
a
little
from
himself
o
agamemnon
let
it
not
be
so
well
consecrate
the
steps
that
ajax
makes
when
they
go
from
achilles
shall
the
proud
lord
that
bastes
his
arrogance
with
his
own
seam
and
never
suffers
matter
of
the
world
enter
his
thoughts
save
such
as
do
revolve
and
ruminate
himself
shall
he
be
worshippd
of
that
we
hold
an
idol
more
than
he
no
this
thriceworthy
and
right
valiant
lord
must
not
so
stale
his
palm
nobly
acquird
nor
by
my
will
assubjugate
his
merit
as
amply
titled
as
achilles
is
by
going
to
achilles
that
were
to
enlard
his
fatalready
pride
and
add
more
coals
to
cancer
when
he
burns
with

great
hyperion
this

rubs
the

of
him

his
silence
drinks
up
this
applause

the
worth
that

paltry
insolent
fellow
how

he
not
be
sociable
the
raven
chides
blackness
ill

even
such

doth
embrace
my
bosom
my
heart
beats
thicker
than
a

will
you

in
my
lord
o
cressida
how
often
have
i
wished
me
thus
wished
my
lord
the
gods
grant
o
my
lord
what
should
they
grant
what
makes
this
pretty
abruption
what
too
curious
dreg
espies
my
sweet
lady
in
the
fountain
of
our
love
more
dregs
than
water
if
my
fears
have
eyes
fears
make
devils
of
cherubins
they
never
see
truly
blind
fear
that
seeing
reason
leads
finds
safer
footing
than
blind
reason
stumbling
without
fear
to
fear
the
worst
oft
cures
the
worse
o
let
my
lady
apprehend
no
fear
in
all
cupids
pageant
there
is
presented
no
monster
nor
nothing
monstrous
neither
nothing
but
our
undertakings
when
we
vow
to
weep
seas
live
in
fire
eat
rocks
tame
tigers
thinking
it
harder
for
our
mistress
to
devise
imposition
enough
than
for
us
to
undergo
any
difficulty
imposed
this
is
the
monstruosity
in
love
lady
that
the
will
is
infinite
and
the
execution
confined
that
the
desire
is
boundless
and
the
act
a
slave
to
limit
they
say
all
lovers
swear
more
performance
than
they
are
able
and
yet
reserve
an
ability
that
they
never
perform
vowing
more
than
the
perfection
of
ten
and
discharging
less
than
the
tenth
part
of
one
they
that
have
the
voice
of
lions
and
the
act
of
hares
are
they
not
monsters
are
there
such
such
are
not
we
praise
us
as
we
are
tasted
allow
us
as
we
prove
our
head
shall
go
bare
till
merit
crown
it
no
perfection
in
reversion
shall
have
a
praise
in
present
we
will
not
name
desert
before
his
birth
and
being
born
his
addition
shall
be
humble
few
words
to
fair
faith
troilus
shall
be
such
to
cressid
as
what
envy
can
say
worst
shall
be
a
mock
for
his
truth
and
what
truth
can
speak
truest
not
truer
than
troilus
will
you
walk
in
my
lord
what
blushing
still
have
you
not
done
talking
yet
well

firm
faith

my
word
for
her
too
our
kindred
though
they
be
long
ere

are
constant
being

burrs
i
can
tell
you
theyll

where
they
are
thrown
boldness

to
me
now
and
brings
me
heart
prince
troilus
i
have
lovd
you
night
and
day
for
many
weary
months
why
was
my
cressid
then
so
hard
to
win
hard
to
seem
won
but
i
was
won
my
lord
with
the
first
glance
that
ever
pardon
me
if
i
confess
much
you
will
play
the
tyrant
i
love
you
now
but
till
now
not
so
much
but
i
might
master
it
in
faith
i
lie
my
thoughts
were
like
unbridled
children
grown
too
headstrong
for
their
mother
see
we
fools
why
have
i
blabbd
who
shall
be
true
to
us
when
we
are
so
unsecret
to
ourselves
but
though
i
lovd
you
well
i
wood
you
not
and
yet
good
faith
i
wishd
myself
a
man
or
that
we
women
had
mens
privilege
of
speaking
first
sweet
bid
me
hold
my
tongue
for
in
this
rapture
i
shall
surely
speak
the
thing
i
shall
repent
see
see
your
silence
cunning
in
dumbness
from
my
weakness
draws
my
very
soul
of
counsel
stop
my
mouth
and
shall
albeit
sweet
music
issues
thence
pretty
i
faith
my
lord
i
do
beseech
you
pardon
me
twas
not
my
purpose
thus
to
beg
a
kiss
i
am
ashamd
o
heavens
what
have
i
done
for
this
time
will
i
take
my
leave
my
lord

leave

leave
till
tomorrow
morning
pray
you
content
you
what
offends
you
lady
sir
mine
own
company
you
cannot
shun
yourself
let
me
go
and
try
i
have
a
kind
of
self
resides
with
you
but
an
unkind
self
that
itself
will
leave
to
be
anothers
fool
i
would
be
gone
where
is
my
wit
i
speak
i
know
not
what
well
know
they
what
they
speak
that
speak
so
wisely
perchance
my
lord
i
show
more
craft
than
love
and
fell
so
roundly
to
a
large
confession
to
angle
for
your
thoughts
but
you
are
wise
or
else
you
love
not
for
to
be
wise
and
love
exceeds
mans
might
that
dwells
with
gods
above
o
that
i
thought
it
could
be
in
a
woman
as
if
it
can
i
will
presume
in
you
to
feed
for
aye
her
lamp
and
flames
of
love
to
keep
her
constancy
in
plight
and
youth
outliving
beautys
outward
with
a
mind
that
doth
renew
swifter
than
blood
decays
or
that
persuasion
could
but
thus
convince
me
that
my
integrity
and
truth
to
you
might
be
affronted
with
the
match
and
weight
of
such
a
winnowd
purity
in
love
how
were
i
then
uplifted
but
alas
i
am
as
true
as
truths
simplicity
and
simpler
than
the
infancy
of
truth
in
that
ill
war
with
you
o
virtuous
fight
when
right
with
right
wars
who
shall
be
most
right
true
swains
in
love
shall
in
the
world
to
come
approve
their
truths
by
troilus
when
their
rimes
full
of
protest
of
oath
and
big
compare
want
similes
truth
tird
with
iteration
as
true
as
steel
as
plantage
to
the
moon
as
sun
to
day
as
turtle
to
her
mate
as
iron
to
adamant
as
earth
to
the
centre
yet
after
all
comparisons
of
truth
as
truths
authentic
author
to
be
cited
as
true
as
troilus
shall
crown
up
the
verse
and
sanctify
the
numbers
prophet
may
you
be
if
i
be
false
or
swerve
a
hair
from
truth
when
time
is
old
and
hath
forgot
itself
when
waterdrops
have
worn
the
stones
of
troy
and
blind
oblivion
swallowd
cities
up
and
mighty
states
characterless
are
grated
to
dusty
nothing
yet
let
memory
from
false
to

among
false
maids
in
love
upbraid
my
falsehood
when
they
have
said
as
false

cressid
in
right
great
exchange
whom
troy
hath
still
denied
but
this
antenor
i
know
is
such
a
wrest
in
their
affairs
that
their
negociations
all
must
slack
wanting
his
manage
and
they
will
almost
give
us
a
prince
of
blood
a
son
of
priam
in
change
of
him
let
him
be
sent
great
princes
and
he
shall
buy
my

accepted
pain

i
undertake
and
tis
a
burden
which
i
am
proud
to
bear
achilles
stands
in
the
entrance
of
his
tent
please
it
our
general
to
pass
strangely
by
him
as
if
he
were
forgot
and
princes
all
lay
negligent
and
loose
regard
upon
him
i
will
come
last
tis
like
hell
question
me
why
such
unplausive
eyes
are
bent
on
him
if
so
i
have
derision
medcinable
to
use
between
your
strangeness
and
his
pride
which
his
own
will
shall
have
desire
to
drink
it
may
do
good
pride
hath
no
other
glass
to
show
itself
but
pride
for
supple
knees
feed
arrogance
and
are
the
poor
mans
fees
well
execute
your
purpose
and
put
on
a
form
of
strangeness
as
we
pass
along
so
do
each
lord
and
either
greet
him
not
or
else
disdainfully
which
shall
shake
him
more
than
if
not
lookd
on
i
will
lead
the
way
what
comes
the
general
to
speak
with
me
you
know
my
mind
ill
fight
no
more
gainst
troy
what
says
achilles
would
he
aught
with
us
would
you
my
lord
aught
with
the
general
no
nothing
my
lord
the
better
good
day
good
day
how
do
you
how
do
you
what
does
the
cuckold
scorn
me
how
now
patroclus
good
morrow
ajax
ha
good
morrow
ay
and
good
next
day
too
what
mean
these
fellows
know
they
not
achilles
they
pass
by
strangely
they
were
usd
to
bend
to
send
their
smiles
before
them
to
achilles
to
come
as
humbly
as
they
usd
to
creep
to
holy
altars
what
am
i
poor
of
late
tis
certain
greatness
once
falln
out
with
fortune
must
fall
out
with
men
too
what
the
declind
is
he
shall
as
soon
read
in
the
eyes
of
others
as
feel
in
his
own
fall
for
men
like
butterflies
show
not
their
mealy
wings
but
to
the
summer
and
not
a
man
for
being
simply
man
hath
any
honour
but
honour
for
those
honours
that
are
without
him
as
places
riches
and
favour
prizes
of
accident
as
oft
as
merit
which
when
they
fall
as
being
slippery
standers
the
love
that
leand
on
them
as
slippery
too
do
one
pluck
down
another
and
together
die
in
the
fall
but
tis
not
so
with
me
fortune
and
i
are
friends
i
do
enjoy
at
ample
point
all
that
i
did
possess
save
these
mens
looks
who
do
methinks
find
out
something
not
worth
in
me
such
rich
beholding
as
they
have
often
given
here
is
ulysses
ill
interrupt
his
reading
how
now
ulysses
now
great
thetis
son
what
are
you
reading
a
strange
fellow
here
writes
me
that
man
how
dearly
ever
parted
how
much
in
having
or
without
or
in
cannot
make
boast
to
have
that
which
he
hath
nor
feels
not
what
he
owes
but
by
reflection
as
when
his
virtues
shining
upon
others
heat
them
and
they
retort
that
heat
again
to
the
first
giver
this
is
not
strange
ulysses
the
beauty
that
is
borne
here
in
the
face
the
bearer
knows
not
but
commends
itself
to
others
eyes
nor
doth
the
eye
itself
that
most
pure
spirit
of
sense
behold
itself
not
going
from
itself
but
eye
to
eye
opposd
salutes
each
other
with
each
others
form
for
speculation
turns
not
to
itself
till
it
hath
travelld
and
is
mirrord
there
where
it
may
see
itself
this
is
not
strange
at
all
i
do
not
strain
at
the
position
it
is
familiar
but
at
the
author
s
drift
who
in
his
circumstance
expressly
proves
that
no
man
is
the
lord
of
any
thing
though
in
and
of
him
there
be
much
consisting
till
he
communicate
his
parts
to
others
nor
doth
he
of
himself
know
them
for
aught
till
he
behold
them
formd
in
the
applause
where
theyre
extended
who
like
an
arch
reverberates
the
voice
again
or
like
a
gate
of
steel
fronting
the
sun
receives
and
renders
back
his
figure
and
his
heat
i
was
much
rapt
in
this
and
apprehended
here
immediately
the
unknown
ajax
heavens
what
a
man
is
there
a
very
horse
that
has
he
knows
not
what
nature
what
things
there
are
most
abject
in
regard
and
dear
in
use
what
things
again
most
dear
in
the
esteem
and
poor
in
worth
now
shall
we
see
tomorrow
an
act
that
very
chance
doth
throw
upon
him
ajax
renownd
o
heavens
what
some
men
do
while
some
men
leave
to
do
how
some
men
creep
in
skittish
fortunes
hall
whiles
others
play
the
idiots
in
her
eyes
how
one
man
eats
into
anothers
pride
while
pride
is
fasting
in
his
wantonness
to
see
these
grecian
lords
why
even
already
they
clap
the
lubber
ajax
on
the
shoulder
as
if
his
foot
were
on
brave
hectors
breast
and
great
troy
shrinking
i
do
believe
it
for
they
passd
by
me
as
misers
do
by
beggars
neither
gave
to
me
good
word
or
look
what
are
my
deeds
forgot
time
hath
my
lord
a
wallet
at
his
back
wherein
he
puts
alms
for
oblivion
a
greatsizd
monster
of
ingratitudes
those
scraps
are
good
deeds
past
which
are
devourd
as
fast
as
they
are
made
forgot
as
soon
as
done
perseverance
dear
my
lord
keeps
honour
bright
to
have
done
is
to
hang
quite
out
of
fashion
like
a
rusty
mail
in
monumental
mockery
take
the
instant
way
for
honour
travels
in
a
strait
so
narrow
where
one
but
goes
abreast
keep
then
the
path
for
emulation
hath
a
thousand
sons
that
one
by
one
pursue
if
you
give
way
or
hedge
aside
from
the
direct
forthright
like
to
an
enterd
tide
they
all
rush
by
and
leave
you
hindmost
or
like
a
gallant
horse
falln
in
first
rank
lie
there
for
pavement
to
the
abject
rear
oerrun
and
trampled
on
then
what
they
do
in
present
though
less
than
yours
in
past
must
oertop
yours
for
time
is
like
a
fashionable
host
that
slightly
shakes
his
parting
guest
by
the
hand
and
with
his
arms
outstretchd
as
he
would
fly
grasps
in
the
comer
welcome
ever
smiles
and
farewell
goes
out
sighing
o
let
not
virtue
seek
remuneration
for
the
thing
it
was
for
beauty
wit
high
birth
vigour
of
bone
desert
in
service
love
friendship
charity
are
subjects
all
to
envious
and
calumniating
time
one
touch
of
nature
makes
the
whole
world
kin
that
all
with
one
consent
praise
newborn
gawds
though
they
are
made
and
moulded
of
things
past
and
give
to
dust
that
is
a
little
gilt
more
laud
than
gilt
oerdusted
the
present
eye
praises
the
present
object
then
marvel
not
thou
great
and
complete
man
that
all
the
greeks
begin
to
worship
ajax
since
things
in
motion
sooner
catch
the
eye
than
what
not
stirs
the
cry
went
once
on
thee
and
still
it
might
and
yet
it
may
again
if
thou
wouldst
not
entomb
thyself
alive
and
case
thy
reputation
in
thy
tent
whose
glorious
deeds
but
in
these
fields
of
late
made
emulous
missions
mongst
the
gods
themselves
and
drave
great
mars
to
faction
of
this
my
privacy
i
have
strong
reasons
but
gainst
your
privacy
the
reasons
are
more
potent
and
heroical
tis
known
achilles
that
you
are
in
love
with
one
of
priams
daughters
ha
known
is
that
a
wonder
the
providence
thats
in
a
watchful
state
knows
almost
every
grain
of
plutus
gold
finds
bottom
in
the
uncomprehensive
deeps
keeps
place
with
thought
and
almost
like
the
gods
does
thoughts
unveil
in
their
dumb
cradles
there
is
a
mystery
with
whom
relation
durst
never
meddle
in
the
soul
of
state
which
hath
an
operation
more
divine
than
breath
or
pen
can
give
expressure
to
all
the
commerce
that
you
have
had
with
troy
as
perfectly
is
ours
as
yours
my
lord
and
better
would
it
fit
achilles
much
to
throw
down
hector
than
polyxena
but
it
must
grieve
young
pyrrhus
now
at
home
when
fame
shall
in
our
islands
sound
her
trump
and
all
the
greekish
girls
shall
tripping
sing
great
hectors
sister
did
achilles
win
but
our
great
ajax
bravely
beat
down
him
farewell
my
lord
i
as
your
lover
speak
the
fool
slides
oer
the
ice
that
you
should
break
to
this
effect
achilles
have
i
movd
you
a
woman
impudent
and
mannish
grown
is
not
more
loathd
than
an
effeminate
man
in
time
of
action
i
stand
condemnd
for
this
they
think
my
little
stomach
to
the
war
and
your
great
love
to
me
restrains
you
thus
sweet
rouse
yourself
and
the
weak
wanton
cupid
shall
from
your
neck
unloose
his
amorous
fold
and
like
a
dewdrop
from
the
lions
mane
be
shook
to
air
shall
ajax
fight
with
hector
ay
and
perhaps
receive
much
honour
by
him
i
see
my
reputation
is
at
stake
my
fame
is
shrewdly
gord
o
then
beware
those
wounds
heal
ill
that
men
do
give
themselves
omission
to
do
what
is
necessary
seals
a
commission
to
a
blank
of
danger
and
danger
like
an
ague
subtly
taints
even
then
when
we
sit
idly
in
the
sun
go
call
thersites
hither
sweet
patroclus
ill
send
the
fool
to
ajax
and
desire
him
t
invite
the
trojan
lords
after
the
combat
to
see
us
here
unarmed
i
have
a
womans
longing
an
appetite
that
i
am
sick
withal
to
see
great
hector
in
his
weeds
of
peace
to
talk
with
him
and
to
behold
his
visage
even
to
my
full
of
view
a
labour
savd
a
wonder
what
ajax
goes
up
and
down
the
field
asking
for
himself
how
so
he
must
fight
singly
tomorrow
with
hector
and
is
so
prophetically
proud
of
an
heroical
cudgelling
that
he
raves
in
saying
nothing
how
can
that
be
why
he
stalks
up
and
down
like
a
peacock
a
stride
and
a
stand
ruminates
like
a
hostess
that
hath
no
arithmetic
but
her
brain
to
set
down
her
reckoning
bites
his
lip
with
a
politic
regard
as
who
should
say
there
were
wit
in
this
head
an
twould
out
and
so
there
is
but
it
lies
as
coldly
in
him
as
fire
in
a
flint
which
will
not
show
without
knocking
the
mans
undone
for
ever
for
if
hector
break
not
his
neck
i
the
combat
hell
breakt
himself
in
vainglory
he
knows
not
me
i
said
good
morrow
ajax
and
he
replies
thanks
agamemnon
what
think
you
of
this
man
that
takes
me
for
the
general
hes
grown
a
very
landfish
languageless
a
monster
a
plague
of
opinion
a
man
may
wear
it
on
both
sides
like
a
leather
jerkin
thou
must
be
my
ambassador
to
him
thersites
who
i
why
hell
answer
nobody
he
professes
not
answering
speaking
is
for
beggars
he
wears
his
tongue
in
his
arms
i
will
put
on
his
presence
let
patroclus
make
demands
to
me
you
shall
see
the
pageant
of
ajax
to
him
patroclus
tell
him
i
humbly
desire
the
valiant
ajax
to
invite
the
most
valorous
hector
to
come
unarmed
to
my
tent
and
to
procure
safeconduct
for
his
person
of
the
magnanimous
and

taste
and
violenteth
in
a
sense
as
strong
as
that
which
causeth
it
how
can
i
moderate
it
if
i
could
temporize
with
my
affection
or
brew
it
to
a
weak
and
colder
palate
the
like
allayment
could
i
give

grief
my

qualifying
dross
no

my

o
troilus
troilus
what
a
pair
of
spectacles
is
here
let
me
embrace
too
o
heart
as
the
goodly
saying
is
o
heart
heavy
heart
why
sighst
thou
without
breaking
when
he
answers
again
because
thou
canst
not
ease
thy
smart
by
friendship
nor
by
speaking
there
was
never
a
truer
rime
let
us
cast
away
nothing
for
we
may
live
to
have
need
of
such
a
verse
we
see
it
we
see
it
how
now
lambs
cressid
i
love
thee
in
so
straind
a
purity
that
the
blessd
gods
as
angry
with
my
fancy
more
bright
in
zeal
than
the
devotion
which
cold
lips
blow
to
their
deities
take
thee
from
me
have
the
gods
envy
ay
ay
ay
ay
tis
too
plain
a
case
and
is
it
true
that
i
must
go
from
troy
a
hateful
truth
what
and
from
troilus
too
from
troy
and
troilus
is
it
possible
and
suddenly
where
injury
of
chance
puts
back
leavetaking
justles
roughly
by
all
time
of
pause
rudely
beguiles
our
lips
of
all
rejoindure
forcibly
prevents
our
lockd
embrasures
strangles
our
dear
vows
even
in
the
birth
of
our
own
labouring
breath
we
two
that
with
so
many
thousand
sighs
did
buy
each
other
must
poorly
sell
ourselves
with
the
rude
brevity
and
discharge
of
one
injurious
time
now
with
a
robbers
haste
crams
his
rich
thievery
up
he
knows
not
how
as
many
farewells
as
be
stars
in
heaven
with
distinct
breath
and
consignd
kisses
to
them
he
fumbles
up
into
a
loose
adieu
and
scants
us
with
a
single
famishd
kiss
distasted
with
the
salt
of
broken
tears
my
lord
is
the
lady
ready
hark
you
are
calld
some
say
the
genius
so
cries
come
to
him
that
instantly
must
die
bid
them
have
patience
she
shall
come
anon
where
are
my
tears
rain
to
lay
this
wind
or
my
heart
will
be
blown
up
by
the
root
i
must
then
to
the
grecians
no
remedy
a
woeful
cressid
mongst
the
merry
greeks
when
shall
we
see
again
hear
me
my
love
be
thou
but
true
of
heart
i
true
how
now
what
wicked
deem
is
this
nay
we
must
use
expostulation
kindly
for
it
is
parting
from
us
i
speak
not
be
thou
true
as
fearing
thee
for
i
will
throw
my
glove
to
death
himself
that
theres
no
maculation
in
thy
heart
but
be
thou
true
say
i
to
fashion
in
my
sequent
protestation
be
thou
true
and
i
will
see
thee
o
you
shall
be
exposd
my
lord
to
dangers
as
infinite
as
imminent
but
ill
be
true
and
ill
grow
friend
with
danger
wear
this
sleeve
and
you
this
glove
when
shall
i
see
you
i
will
corrupt
the
grecian
sentinels
to
give
thee
nightly
visitation
but
yet
be
true
o
heavens
be
true
again
hear
why
i
speak
it
love
the
grecian
youths
are
full
of
quality
theyre
loving
well
composd
with
gifts
of
nature
flowing
and
swelling
oer
with
arts
and
exercise
how
novelty
may
move
and
parts
with
person
alas
a
kind
of
godly
jealousy
which
i
beseech
you
call
a
virtuous
sin
makes
me
afeard
o
heavens
you
love
me
not
die
i
a
villain
then
in
this
i
do
not
call
your
faith
in
question
so
mainly
as
my
merit
i
cannot
sing
nor
heel
the
high
lavolt
nor
sweeten
talk
nor
play
at
subtle
games
fair
virtues
all
to
which
the
grecians
are
most
prompt
and
pregnant
but
i
can
tell
that
in
each
grace
of
these
there
lurks
a
still
and
dumbdiscoursive
devil
that
tempts
most
cunningly
but
be
not
tempted
do
you
think
i
will
no
but
something
may
be
done
that
we
will
not
and
sometimes
we
are
devils
to
ourselves
when
we
will
tempt
the
frailty
of
our
powers
presuming
on
their
changeful
potency
nay
good
my
lord
come
kiss
and
let
us
part
brother
troilus
good
brother
come
you
hither
and
bring
neas
and
the
grecian
with
you
my
lord
will
you
be
true
who
i
alas
it
is
my
vice
my
fault
while
others
fish
with
craft
for
great
opinion
i
with
great
truth
catch
mere
simplicity
whilst
some
with
cunning
gild
their
copper
crowns
with
truth
and
plainness
i
do
wear
mine
bare
fear
not
my
truth
the
moral
of
my
wit
is
plain
and
true
theres
all
the
reach
of
it
welcome

hector

hector
have
it
he
cares
not
hell
obey

tis
done
like
hector
but
securely
done
a

proudly
and
great

misprising
the

not
achilles
sir
what
is
your

nothing
therefore
achilles
but
whateer
know
this
in
the
extremity
of
great
and
little
valour

pride
excel
themselves
in
hector
the
one
almost
as
infinite
as
all
the
other
blank
as
nothing
weigh
him
well
and
that
which
looks
like
pride
is
courtesy
this
ajax
is
half
made
of
hectors
blood
in
love
whereof
half
hector
stays
at
home
half
heart
half
hand
half
hector
comes
to
seek
this
blended
knight
half
trojan
and
half
greek
a
maiden
battle
then
o
i
perceive
you
here
is
sir
diomed
go
gentle
knight
stand
by
our
ajax
as
you
and
lord
neas
consent
upon
the
order
of
their
fight
so
be
it
either
to
the
uttermost
or
else
a
breath
the
combatants
being
kin
half
stints
their
strife
before
their
strokes
begin
they
are
opposd
already
what
trojan
is
that
same
that
looks
so
heavy
the
youngest
son
of
priam
a
true
knight
not
yet
mature
yet
matchless
firm
of
word
speaking
in
deeds
and
deedless
in
his
tongue
not
soon
provokd
nor
being
provokd
soon
calmd
his
heart
and
hand
both
open
and
both
free
for
what
he
has
he
gives
what
thinks
he
shows
yet
gives
he
not
till
judgment
guide
his
bounty
nor
dignifies
an
impure
thought
with
breath
manly
as
hector
but
more
dangerous
for
hector
in
his
blaze
of
wrath
subscribes
to
tender
objects
but
he
in
heat
of
action
is
more
vindicative
than
jealous
love
they
call
him
troilus
and
on
him
erect
a
second
hope
as
fairly
built
as
hector
thus
says
neas
one
that
knows
the
youth
even
to
his
inches
and
with
private
soul
did
in
great
ilion
thus
translate
him
to
me
they
are
in
action
now
ajax
hold
thine
own
hector
thou
sleepst
awake
thee
his
blows
are
well
disposd
there
ajax
you
must
no
more
princes
enough
so
please
you
i
am
not
warm
yet
let
us
fight
again
as
hector
pleases
why
then
will
i
no
more
thou
art
great
lord
my
fathers
sisters
son
a
cousingerman
to
great
priams
seed
the
obligation
of
our
blood
forbids
a
gory
emulation
twixt
us
twain
were
thy
commixtion
greek
and
trojan
so
that
thou
couldst
say
this
hand
is
grecian
all
and
this
is
trojan
the
sinews
of
this
leg
all
greek
and
this
all
troy
my
mothers
blood
runs
on
the
dexter
cheek
and
this
sinister
bounds
in
my
fathers
by
jove
multipotent
thou
shouldst
not
bear
from
me
a
greekish
member
wherein
my
sword
had
not
impressure
made
of
our
rank
feud
but
the
just
gods
gainsay
that
any
drop
thou
borrowdst
from
thy
mother
my
sacred
aunt
should
by
my
mortal
sword
be
draind
let
me
embrace
thee
ajax
by
him
that
thunders
thou
hast
lusty
arms
hector
would
have
them
fall
upon
him
thus
cousin
all
honour
to
thee
i
thank
thee
hector
thou
art
too
gentle
and
too
free
a
man
i
came
to
kill
thee
cousin
and
bear
hence
a
great
addition
earned
in
thy
death
not
neoptolemus
so
mirable
on
whose
bright
crest
fame
with
her
loudst
byes
cries
this
is
he
could
promise
to
himself
a
thought
of
added
honour
torn
from
hector
there
is
expectance
here
from
both
the
sides
what
further
you
will
do
well
answer
it
the
issue
is
embracement
ajax
farewell
if
i
might
in
entreaties
find
success
as

chance

searching
eyes

his
large
and
portly
size

welcome
as

such
an
enemy
but
thats
no
welcome
understand
more
clear
whats
past
and
whats
to

deadly
theme
o

offend
i
have
thou
gallant
trojan
seen
thee
oft
labouring
for
destiny
make
cruel
way
through
ranks
of
greekish
youth
and
i
have
seen
thee
as
hot
as
perseus
spur
thy
phrygian
steed
despising
many
forfeits
and
subduements
when
thou
hast
hung
thy
advancd
sword
i
th
air
not
letting
it
decline
on
the
declind
that
i
have
said
to
some
my
standersby
lo
jupiter
is
yonder
dealing
life
and
i
have
seen
thee
pause
and
take
thy
breath
when
that
a
ring
of
greeks
have
hemmd
thee
in
like
an
olympian
wrestling
this
have
i
seen
but
this
thy
countenance
still
lockd
in
steel
i
never
saw
till
now
i
knew
thy
grandsire
and
once
fought
with
him
he
was
a
soldier
good
but
by
great
mars
the
captain
of
us
all
never
like
thee
let
an
old
man
embrace
thee
and
worthy
warrior
welcome
to
our
tents
tis
the
old
nestor
let
me
embrace
thee
good
old
chronicle
that

so
long
walkd
hand
in
hand
with
time
most
reverend
nestor
i
am
glad
to
clasp
thee
i
would
my
arms
could
match
thee
in
contention
as
they
contend
with

in
courtesy

would
they

ha
by
this
white
beard
id
fight
with
thee
tomorrow
well
welcome
welcome

how
yonder

here
her
base
and
pillar
by
us
i
know
your
favour
lord
ulysses
well
ah
sir
theres
many
a
greek
and
trojan
dead
since

and
diomed
in
ilion
on
your
greekish
embassy
sir
i
foretold
you
then
what
would
ensue
my
prophecy
is
but
half
his
journey
yet
for
yonder
walls
that
pertly
front
your
town
yond
towers
whose
wanton
tops
do
buss
the
clouds
must
kiss
their
own
feet
i
must
not
believe
you
there
they
stand
yet
and
modestly
i
think
the
fall
of
every
phrygian
stone
will
cost
a
drop
of
grecian
blood
the
end
crowns
all
and
that
old
common
arbitrator
time
will
one
day
end
it
so
to
him
we
leave
it
most
gentle
and
most
valiant
hector
welcome
after
the
general
i
beseech
you
next
to
feast
with
me
and
see
me
at
my
tent
i
shall
forestall
thee
lord
ulysses

book
of

in

so
oppress
me
with
thine
eye
tell

you
heavens
in
which
part
of
his
body

destroy
him
whether
there
or
there

there
that
i
may
give
the
local
wound
a
name
and
make
distinct
the
very
breach
whereout
hectors
great
spirit
flew
answer
me
heavens
it
would
discredit
the
blessd
gods
proud
man
to
answer
such
a
question
stand
again
thinkst
thou
to
catch
my
life
so
pleasantly
as
to
prenominate
in
nice
conjecture
where
thou
wilt
hit
me
dead

tell
thee
yea
wert
thou
an
oracle
to
tell
me
so

where

insolence

folly
from
my

goodnight
i
prithee
come
troilus
farewell
one
eye
yet
looks
on
thee
but
with
my
heart
the
other
eye
doth
see
ah
poor
our
sex
this
fault
in
us
i
find
the
error
of
our
eye
directs
our
mind
what
error
leads
must
err
o
then
conclude
minds
swayd
by
eyes
are
full
of
turpitude
a
proof
of
strength
she
could
not
publish
more
unless
she
said
my
mind
is
now
turnd
whore
alls
done
my
lord
it
is
why
stay
we
then
to
make
a
recordation
to
my
soul
of
every
syllable
that
here
was
spoke
but
if
i
tell
how
these
two
did
coact
shall
i
not
lie
in
publishing
a
truth
sith
yet
there
is
a
credence
in
my
heart
an
esperance
so
obstinately
strong
that
doth
invert
the
attest
of
eyes
and
ears
as
if
those
organs
had
deceptions
functions
created
only
to
calumniate
was
cressid
here
i
cannot
conjure
trojan
she
was
not
sure
most
sure
she
was
why
my
negation
hath
no
taste
of
madness
nor
mine
my
lord
cressid
was
here
but
now
let
it
not
be
believd
for
womanhood
think
we
had
mothers
do
not
give
advantage
to
stubborn
critics
apt
without
a
theme
for
depravation
to
square
the
general
sex
by
cressids
rule
rather
think
this
not
cressid
what
hath
she
done
prince
that
can
soil
our
mothers
nothing
at
all
unless
that
this
were
she
will
he
swagger
himself
out
ons
own
eyes
this
she
no
this
is
diomeds
cressida
if
beauty
have
a
soul
this
is
not
she
if
souls
guide
vows
if
vows
be
sanctimony
if
sanctimony
be
the
gods
delight
if
there
be
rule
in
unity
itself
this
is
not
she
o
madness
of
discourse
that
cause
sets
up
with
and
against
itself
bifold
authority
where
reason
can
revolt
without
perdition
and
loss
assume
all
reason
without
revolt
this
is
and
is
not
cressid
within
my
soul
there
doth
conduce
a
fight
of
this
strange
nature
that
a
thing
inseparate
divides
more
wider
than
the
sky
and
earth
and
yet
the
spacious
breadth
of
this
division
admits
no
orifice
for
a
point
as
subtle
as
ariachnes
broken
woof
to
enter
instance
o
instance
strong
as
plutos
gates
cressid
is
mine
tied
with
the
bonds
of
heaven
instance
o
instance
strong
as
heaven
itself
the
bonds
of
heaven
are
slippd
dissolvd
and
loosd
and
with
another
knot
fivefingertied
the
fractions
of
her
faith
orts
of
her
love
the
fragments
scraps
the
bits
and
greasy
reliques
of
her
oereaten
faith
are
bound
to
diomed
may
worthy
troilus
be
half
attachd
with
that
which
here
his
passion
doth
express
ay
greek
and
that
shall
be
divulged
well
in
characters
as
red
as
mars
his
heart
inflamd
with
venus
never
did
young
man
fancy
with
so
eternal
and
so
fixd
a
soul
hark
greek
as
much
as
i
do
cressid
love
so
much
by
weight

i
her

that
sleeve
is
mine
that
hell
bear
on
his

were
it
a

composd
by

my

should
bite
it
not
the
dreadful

shipmen
do
the
hurricano
call
constringd
in
mass
by
the
almighty
sun
shall
dizzy
with
more

shall
my

tickle
it
for

o
false
cressid
false

let
all
untruths
stand
by
thy
stained

i
have
been
seeking

i
could
meet
that
rogue
diomed
i
would
croak
like
a
raven
i
would
bode
i
would
bode
patroclus
would
give
me
any
thing
for
the
intelligence
of
this
whore
the
parrot
will
not
do
more
for
an
almond
than
he
for
a
commodious
drab
lechery
lechery
still
wars
and
lechery
nothing
else
holds
fashion
a
burning
devil
take
them
when
was
my
lord
so
much
ungently
temperd
to
stop
his
ears
against
admonishment
unarm
unarm
and
do
not
fight
today
you
train
me
to
offend
you
get
you
in
by
all
the
everlasting
gods
ill
go
my
dreams
will
sure
prove
ominous
to
the
day
no
more
i
say
where
is
my
brother
hector
here
sister
armd
and
bloody
in
intent
consort
with
me
in
loud
and
dear
petition
pursue
we
him
on
knees
for
i
have
dreamd
of
bloody
turbulence
and
this
whole
night
hath
nothing
been
but
shapes
and
forms
of
slaughter
o
tis
true
ho
bid
my
trumpet
sound
no
notes
of
sally
for
the
heavens
sweet
brother
be
gone
i
say
the
gods
have
heard
me
swear
the
gods
are
deaf
to
hot
and
peevish
vows
they
are
polluted
offerings
more
abhorrd
than
spotted
livers
in
the
sacrifice
o
be
persuaded
do
not
count
it
holy
to
hurt
by
being
just
it
is
as
lawful
for
we
would
give
much
to
use
violent
thefts
and
rob
in
the
behalf
of
charity
it
is
the
purpose
that
makes
strong
the
vow
but
vows
to
every
purpose
must
not
hold
unarm
sweet
hector
hold
you
still
i
say
mine
honour
keeps
the
weather
of
my
fate
life
every
man
holds
dear
but
the
dear
man
holds
honour
far
more
preciousdear
than
life
how
now
young
man
meanst
thou
to
fight
today
cassandra
call
my
father
to
persuade
no
faith
young
troilus

am
today
i
the
vein
of
chivalry
let
grow
thy
sinews
till
their
knots
be
strong
and

yet
the
brushes
of
the
war
unarm
thee
go
and
doubt
thou
not
brave
boy
ill
stand
today
for
thee
and
me
and
troy
brother
you
have
a
vice
of
mercy
in
you
which
better
fits
a
lion
than
a
man
what
vice
is
that
good
troilus
chide
me
for
it
when
many
times
the
captive
grecian
falls
even
in
the
fan
and
wind
of
your
fair
sword
you
bid
them
rise
and
live
o
tis
fair
play
fools
play
by
heaven
hector
how
now

now
for
the
love
of
all
the
gods
lets
leave
the
hermit
pity
with
our
mothers
and
when
we
have
our
armours
buckled
on
the
venomd
vengeance

upon
our
swords

them
to
ruthful
work

would
not
have

with
fiery
truncheon

thus
is
the
poor

despised
o
traitors

bawds
how
earnestly
are
you

and
how
ill
requited
why
should
our

be
so
loved
and
the
performance
so
loathed
what
verse
for
it
what
instance
for
it
let
me
see
full
merrily
the
humblebee
doth
sing
till
he
hath
lost
his

his

and
being

together
fail
good

in
the

as
many
as
be
here
of

your

half
out
weep
out
at

fall
or
if
you
cannot
weep
yet
give
some
groans
though
not
for

yet
for
your
aching
bones
brethren
and
sisters
of
the
holddoor
trade
some
two
months
hence
my
will
shall
here
be
made
it
should
be
now
but
that
my
fear
is
this
some
galled
goose
of
winchester
would
hiss
till
then
ill
sweat
and
seek
about
for
eases
and
at
that
time
bequeath
you
my
diseases
twelfthnight
or
what
you
will
if
music
be
the
food
of
love
play
on
give
me
excess
of
it
that
surfeiting
the
appetite
may
sicken
and
so
die
that
strain
again
it
had
a
dying
fall
o
it
came
oer
my
ear
like
the
sweet
sound
that
breathes
upon
a
bank
of
violets
stealing
and
giving
odour
enough
no
more
tis
not
so
sweet
now
as
it
was
before
o
spirit
of
love
how
quick
and
fresh
art
thou
that
notwithstanding
thy
capacity
receiveth
as
the
sea
nought
enters
there
of
what
validity
and
pitch
soeer
but
falls
into
abatement
and
low
price
even
in
a
minute
so
full
of
shapes
is
fancy
that
it
alone
is
high
fantastical
will
you
go
hunt
my
lord
what
curio
the
hart
why
so
i
do
the
noblest
that
i
have
o
when
mine
eyes
did
see
olivia
first
methought
she
purgd
the
air
of
pestilence
that
instant
was
i
turnd
into
a
hart
and
my
desires
like
fell
and
cruel
hounds
eer
since
pursue
me
how
now
what
news
from
her
so
please
my
lord
i
might
not
be
admitted
but
from
her
handmaid
do
return
this
answer
the
element
itself
till
seven
years
heat
shall
not
behold
her
face
at
ample
view
but
like
a
cloistress
she
will
veiled
walk
and
water
once
a
day
her
chamber
round
with
eveoffending
brine
all
this
to
season
a
brothers
dead
love
which
she
would
keep
fresh
and
lasting
in
her
sad
remembrance
o
she
that
hath
a
heart
of
that
fine
frame
to
pay
this
debt
of
love
but
to
a
brother
how
will
she
love
when
the
rich
golden
shaft
hath
killd
the
flock
of
all
affections
else
that
live
in
her
when
liver
brain
and
heart
these
sovereign
thrones
are
all
supplied
and
filld
her
sweet
perfections
with
one
self
king
away
before
me
to
sweet
beds
of
flowers
lovethoughts
lie
rich
when
canopied
with
bowers
what
country
friends
is
this
this
is
illyria
lady
and
what
should
i
do
in
illyria
my
brother
he
is
in
elysium
perchance
he
is
not
drownd
what
think
you
sailors
it
is
perchance
that
you
yourself
were
savd
o
my
poor
brother
and
so
perchance
may
he
be
true
madam
and
to
comfort
you
with
chance
assure
yourself
after
our
ship
did
split
when
you
and
those
poor
number
savd
with
you
hung
on
our
driving
boat
i
saw
your
brother
most
provident
in
peril
bind
himself
courage
and
hope
both
teaching
him
the
practice
to
a
strong
mast
that
livd
upon
the
sea
where
like
arion
on
the
dolphins
back
i
saw
him
hold
acquaintance
with
the
waves
so
long
as
i
could
see
for
saying
so
theres
gold
mine
own
escape
unfoldeth
to
my
hope
whereto
thy
speech
serves
for
authority
the
like
of
him
knowst
thou
this
country
ay
madam
well
for
i
was
bred
and
born
not
three
hours
travel
from
this
very
place
who
governs
here
a
noble
duke
in
nature
as
in

speak
to
him
in
many
sorts
of
music
that
will
allow
me
very
worth
his
service
what
else

hanged
for
being
so
long
absent
or
to

not
that
as
good
as

hanging
to
you

a

hanging
prevents
a
bad
marriage

for
turning

let
summer
bear
it
out

him
to
understand
so
much
and
therefore
comes
to
speak
with
you
i
told
him
you
were
asleep
he
seems
to
have
a
foreknowledge
of
that
too
and
therefore
comes
to
speak
with
you
what
is
to
be
said
to
him
lady
hes
fortified
against
any
denial
tell
him
he
shall
not
speak
with
me
has
been
told
so
and
he
says
hell
stand
at
your
door
like
a
sheriffs
post
and
be
the
supporter
to
a
bench
but
hell
speak
with
you
what
kind
o
man
is
he
why
of
mankind
what
manner
of
man
of
very
ill
manner
hell
speak
with
you
will
you
or
no
of
what
personage
and
years
is
he
not
yet
old
enough
for
a
man
nor
young
enough
for
a
boy
as
a
squash
is
before
tis
a
peascod
or
a
codling
when
tis
almost
an
apple
tis
with
him
in
standing
water
between
boy
and
man
he
is
very
wellfavoured
and
he
speaks
very
shrewishly
one
would
think
his
mothers
milk
were
scarce
out
of
him
let
him
approach
call
in
my
gentlewoman
gentlewoman
my
lady
calls

honourable
lady
of
the
house
which

to
me
i
shall
answer
for
her
your
will
most
radiant
exquisite
and
unmatchable
beauty
i
pray
you
tell
me
if
this
be
the
lady
of
the
house
for
i
never
saw
her
i
would
be
loath
to
cast
away
my
speech
for
besides
that
it
is
excellently
well
penned
i
have
taken
great
pains
to
con
it
good
beauties
let
me
sustain
no
scorn
i
am
very
comptible
even
to
the
least
sinister
usage
whence
came
you
sir
i
can
say
little
more
than
i
have
studied
and
that
questions
out
of
my
part
good
gentle
one
give
me
modest
assurance
if
you
be
the
lady
of
the
house
that
i
may
proceed
in
my
speech
are
you
a
comedian
no
my
profound
heart
and
yet
by
the
very
fangs
of
malice
i
swear
i
am
not
that
i
play
are
you
the
lady
of
the
house
if
i
do
not
usurp
myself
i
am
most
certain
if
you
are
she
you
do
usurp
yourself
for
what
is
yours
to
bestow
is
not
yours
to
reserve
but
this
is
from
my
commission
i
will
on
with
my
speech
in
your
praise
and
then
show
you
the
heart
of
my
message
come
to
what
is
important
int
i
forgive
you
the
praise
alas
i
took
great
pains
to
study
it
and
tis
poetical
it
is
the
more
like
to
be
feigned
i
pray
you
keep
it
in
i
heard
you
were
saucy
at
my
gates
and
allowed
your
approach
rather
to
wonder
at
you
than
to
hear
you
if
you
be
not
mad
be
gone
if
you
have
reason
be
brief
tis
not
that
time
of
moon
with
me
to
make
one
in
so
skipping
a
dialogue
will
you
hoist
sail
sir
here
lies
your
way
no
good
swabber
i
am
to
hull
here
a
little
longer
some
mollification
for
your
giant
sweet
lady
tell
me
your
mind
i
am
a
messenger
sure
you
have
some
hideous
matter
to
deliver
when
the
courtesy
of
it
is
so
fearful
speak
your
office
it
alone
concerns
your
ear
i
bring
no
overture
of
war
no
taxation
of
homage
i
hold
the
olive
in
my
hand
my
words
are
as
full
of
peace
as
matter
yet
you
began
rudely
what
are
you
what
would
you
the
rudeness
that
hath
appeard
in
me
have
i
learnd
from
my
entertainment
what
i
am
and
what
i
would
are
as
secret
as
maidenhead
to
your
ears
divinity
to
any
others
profanation
give
us
the
place
alone
we
will
hear
this
divinity
now
sir
what
is
your
text
most
sweet
lady
a
comfortable
doctrine
and
much
may
be
said
of
it
where
lies
your
text
in
orsinos
bosom
in
his
bosom
in
what
chapter
of
his
bosom
to
answer
by
the
method
in
the
first
of
his
heart
o
i
have
read
it
it
is
heresy
have
you
no
more
to
say
good
madam
let
me
see
your
face
have
you
any
commission
from
your
lord
to
negotiate
with
my
face
you
are
now
out
of
your
text
but
we
will
draw
the
curtain
and
show
you
the
picture
look

sir
such
a
one
i
was
as
this
present

in
grain
sir
twill
endure

blent
whose
red
and
white
natures

sweet
and
cunning
hand
laid
on
lady
you
are
tho
cruellst
she
alive
if
you
will
lead
these
graces
to
the
grave
and
leave
the
world
no
copy
o
sir
i
will
not
be
so
hardhearted
i
will
give
out
divers
schedules
of
my
beauty
it
shall
be
inventoried
and
every
particle
and
utensil
labelled
to
my
will
as
item
two
lips
indifferent
red
item
two
grey
eyes
with
lids
to
them
item
one
neck
one
chin
and
so
forth
were
you
sent
hither
to
praise
me
i
see
you
what
you
are

are
too
proud
but
if
you
were
the
devil
you
are
fair
my
lord
and
master
loves
you
o
such
love
could
be
but
recompensd
though
you
were
crownd
the
nonpareil
of
beauty
how
does
he
love
me
with
adorations
with
fertile
tears
with
groans
that
thunder
love
with
sighs
of
fire
your
lord
does
know
my
mind
i
cannot
love
him
yet
i
suppose
him
virtuous
know
him
noble
of
great
estate
of
fresh
and
stainless
youth
in
voices
well
divulgd
free
learnd
and
valiant
and
in
dimension
and
the
shape
of
nature
a
gracious
person
but
yet
i
cannot
love
him
he
might
have
took
his
answer
long
ago
if
i
did
love
you
in
my
masters
flame
with
such
a
suffering
such
a
deadly
life
in
your
denial
i
would
find
no
sense
i
would
not
understand
it
why
what
would
you
make
me
a
willow
cabin
at
your
gate
and
call
upon
my
soul
within
the
house
write
loyal
cantons
of
contemned
love
and
sing
them
loud
even
in
the
dead
of
night
holla
your
name
to
the
reverberate
hills
and
make
the
babbling
gossip
of
the
air
cry
out
olivia
o
you
should
not
rest
between
the
elements
of
air
and
earth
but
you
should
pity
me
you
might
do
much
what
is
your
parentage
above
my
fortune
yet
my
state
is
well
i
am
a
gentleman
get
you
to
your
lord
i
cannot
love
him
let
him
send
no
more
unless
perchance
you
come
to
me
again
to
tell
me
how
he
takes
it
fare
you
well
i
thank
you
for
your
pains

this
for
me

his
heart
of
flint
that
you
shall
love
and
let
your
fervour
like
my
masters
be
placd
in
contempt

fair
cruelty
what
is
your
parentage
above
my
fortunes
yet
my
state

well
i
am
a
gentleman
ill
be
sworn
thou
art
thy
tongue
thy
face
thy
limbs
actions
and
spirit
do
give
thee
fivefold
blazon
not
too
fast
soft
soft
unless
the
master
were
the
man
how
now
even
so
quickly
may
one
catch
the
plague
methinks
i
feel
this
youths
perfections
with
an
invisible
and
subtle
stealth
to
creep
in
at
mine
eyes
well
let
it
be
what
ho
malvolio
here
madam
at
your
service
run
after
that
same
peevish
messenger
the
countys
man
he
left
this
ring
behind
him
would
i
or
not
tell
him
ill
none
of
it
desire
him
not
to
flatter
with
his
lord
nor
hold
him
up
with
hopes
im
not
for
him
if
that
the
youth
will
come
this
way
tomorrow
ill
give
him
reasons
fort
hie
thee
malvolio
madam
i
will
i
do
i
know
not
what
and
fear
to
find
mine
eye
too
great
a
flatterer
for
my
mind
fate
show
thy
force
ourselves
we
do
not
owe
what
is
decreed
must
be
and
be
this
so
will
you
stay
no
longer
nor
will
you
not
that
i
go
with
you
by
your
patience
no
my
stars
shine
darkly
over
me
the
malignancy
of
my
fate
might
perhaps
distemper
yours
therefore
i
shall
crave
of
you
your
leave
that
i
may
bear
my
evils
alone
it
were
a
bad
recompense
for
your
love
to
lay
any
of
them
on
you
let
me
yet
know
of
you
whither
you
are
bound
no
sooth
sir
my
determinate
voyage
is
mere
extravagancy
but
i
perceive
in
you
so
excellent
a
touch
of
modesty
that
you
will
not
extort
from
me
what
i
am
willing
to
keep
in
therefore
it
charges
me
in
manners
the
rather
to
express
myself
you
must
know
of
me
then
antonio
my
name
is
sebastian
which
i
called
roderigo
my
father
was
that
sebastian
of
messaline
whom
i
know
you
have
heard
of
he
left
behind
him
myself
and
a
sister
both
born
in
an
hour
if
the
heavens
had
been
pleased
would
we
had
so
ended
but
you
sir
altered
that
for
some
hour
before
you
took
me
from
the
breach
of
the
sea
was
my
sister
drowned
alas
the
day
a
lady
sir
though
it
was
said
she
much
resembled
me
was
yet
of
many
accounted
beautiful
but
though
i
could
not
with
such
estimable
wonder
overfar
believe
that
yet
thus
far
i
will
boldly
publish
her
she
bore
a
mind
that
envy
could
not
but
call
fair
she
is
drowned
already
sir
with
salt
water
though
i
seem
to
drown
her
remembrance
again
with
more
pardon
me
sir
your
bad
entertainment
o
good
antonio
forgive
me
your
trouble
if
you
will
not
murder
me
for
my
love
let
me
be
your
servant
if
you
will
not
undo
what
you
have
done
that
is
kill
him
whom
you
have
recovered
desire
it
not
fare
ye
well
at
once
my
bosom
is
full
of
kindness
and
i
am
yet
so
near
the
manners
of
my
mother
that
upon
the
least
occasion
more
mine
eyes
will
tell
tales
of
me
i
am
bound
to
the
count
orsinos
court
farewell
the
gentleness
of
all
the
gods
go
with
thee
i
have
many
enemies
in
orsinos
court
else
would
i
very
shortly
see
thee
there
but
come
what
may
i
do
adore
thee
so
that
danger
shall
seem
sport
and
i
will
go
were
not
you
even
now
with
the
countess
olivia
even
now
sir
on
a
moderate
pace
i
have
since
arrived
but
hither
she
returns
this
ring
to
you
sir
you
might
have
saved
me
my
pains
to
have
taken
it
away
yourself
she
adds
moreover
that
you
should
put
your
lord
into
a
desperate
assurance
she
will
none
of
him
and
one
thing
more
that
you
be
never
so
hardy
to
come
again
in
his
affairs
unless
it
be
to
report
your
lords
taking
of
this
receive
it
so
she
took
the
ring
of
me
ill
none
of
it
come
sir
you
peevishly
threw
it
to
her
and
her
will
is
it
should
be
so
returned
if
it
be
worth
stooping
for
there
it
lies
in
your
eye
if
not
be
it
his
that
finds
it
i
left
no
ring
with
her
what
means
this
lady
fortune
forbid
my
outside
have
not
charmd
her
she
made
good
view
of
me
indeed
so
much
that
sure
methought
her
eyes
had
lost
her
tongue
for
she
did
speak
in
starts
distractedly
she
loves
me
sure
the
cunning
of
her
passion
invites
me
in
this
churlish
messenger
none
of
my
lords
ring
why
he
sent
her
none
i
am
the
man
if
it
be
so
as
tis
poor
lady
she
were
better
love
a
dream
disguise
i
see
thou
art
a
wickedness
wherein
the
pregnant
enemy
does
much
how
easy
is
it
for
the
properfalse
in
womens
waxen
hearts
to
set
their
forms
alas
our
frailty
is
the
cause
not
we
for
such
as
we
are
made
of
such
we
be
how
will
this
fadge
my
master
loves
her
dearly
and
i
poor
monster
fond
as
much
on
him
and
she
mistaken
seems
to
dote
on
me
what
will
become
of
this
as
i
am
man
my
state
is
desperate
for
my
masters
love
as
i
am
woman
now
alas
the
day
what
thriftless
sighs
shall
poor
olivia
breathe
o
time
thou
must
untangle
this
not
i
it
is
too
hard
a
knot
for
me
to
untie
approach
sir
andrew
not
to
be
abed
after
midnight
is
to
be
up
betimes
and
diluculo
surgere
thou
knowest
nay
by
my
troth
i
know
not
but
i
know
to
be
up
late
is
to
be
up
late
a
false
conclusion
i
hate
it
as
an
unfilled
can
to
be
up
after
midnight
and
to
go
to
bed
then
is
early
so
that
to
go
to
bed
after
midnight
is
to
go
to
bed
betimes
does
not
our
life
consist
of
the
four
elements

think

rather
consists
of
eating

a
common
recreation

wit
enough

in
my
bed
i

i

a
kind
of
puritan

like
a
dog
what
for
being
a
puritan
thy
exquisite
reason
dear
knight
i
have
no
exquisite
reason
fort
but
i
have
reason
good
enough
the
devil
a
puritan
that
he
is
or
anything
constantly
but
a
timepleaser
an
affectioned
ass
that
cons
state
without
book
and
utters
it
by
great
swarths
the
best
persuaded
of
himself
so
crammed
as
he
thinks
with
excellences
that
it
is
his
ground
of
faith
that
all
that
look
on
him
love
him
and
on
that
vice
in
him
will
my
revenge
find
notable
cause
to
work
what
wilt
thou
do
i
will
drop
in
his
way
some
obscure
epistles
of
love
wherein
by
the
colour
of
his
beard
the
shape
of
his
leg
the
manner
of
his
gait
the
expressure
of
his
eye
forehead
and
complexion
he
shall
find
himself
most
feelingly
personated
i
can
write
very
like
my
lady
your
niece
on
a
forgotten
matter
we
can
hardly
make
distinction
of
our
hands
excellent
i
smell
a
device
i
havet
in
my
nose
too
he
shall
think
by
the
letters
that
thou
wilt
drop
that
they
come
from
my
niece
and
that
she
is
in
love
with
him
my
purpose
is
indeed
a
horse
of
that
colour
and
your
horse
now
would
make
him
an
ass
ass
i
doubt
not
o
twill
be
admirable
sport
royal
i
warrant
you
i
know
my
physic
will
work
with
him
i
will
plant
you
two
and
let
the
fool
make
a
third
where
he
shall
find
the
letter
observe
his
construction
of
it
for
this
night
to
bed

dream
on
the
event

now
come
knight
come
knight
give
me
some
music
now
good
morrow
friends
now
good
cesario
but
that
piece
of
song
that
old
and
antique
song
we
heard
last
night
methought
it
did
relieve
my
passion
much
more
than
light
airs
and
recollected
terms
of
these
most
brisk
and
giddypaced
times
come
but
one
verse
he
is
not
here
so
please
your
lordship
that
should
sing
it
who
was
it
feste
the
jester
my
lord
a
fool
that
the
lady
olivias
father
took
much
delight
in
he
is
about
the
house
seek
him
out
and
play
the
tune
the
while
come
hither
boy
if
ever
thou
shalt
love
in
the
sweet
pangs
of
it
remember
me
for
such
as
i
am
all
true
lovers
are
unstaid
and
skittish
in
all
motions
else
save
in
the
constant
image
of
the
creature
that
is
belovd
how
dost
thou
like
this
tune
it
gives
a
very
echo
to
the
seat
where
love
is
thrond
thou
dost
speak
masterly
my
life
upont
young
though
thou
art
thine
eye
hath
stayd
upon
some
favour
that
it
loves
hath
it
not
boy
a
little
by
your
favour
what
kind
of
woman
ist
of
your
complexion
she
is
not
worth
thee
then
what
years
i
faith
about
your
years
my
lord
too
old
by
heaven
let
still
the
woman
take
an
elder
than
herself
so
wears
she
to
him
so
sways
she
level
in
her
husbands
heart
for
boy
however
we
do
praise
ourselves
our
fancies
are
more
giddy
and
unfirm
more
longing
wavering
sooner
lost
and
worn
than
womens
are
i
think
it
well
my
lord
then
let
thy
love
be
younger
than
thyself
or
thy
affection
cannot
hold
the
bent
for
women
are
as
roses
whose
fair
flower
being
once
displayd
doth
fall
that
very
hour
and
so
they
are
alas
that
they
are
so
to
die
even
when
they
to
perfection
grow
o
fellow
come
the
song
we
had
last
night
mark
it
cesario
it
is
old
and
plain
the
spinsters
and
the
knitters
in
the
sun
and
the
free
maids
that
weave
their
thread
with
bones
do
use
to
chant
it
it
is
silly
sooth
and
dallies
with
the
innocence
of
love
like
the
old
age
are
you
ready
sir
ay
prithee
sing
come
away
come
away
death
and
in
sad
cypress
let
me
be
laid
fly
away
fly
away
breath
i
am
slain
by
a
fair
cruel
maid
my
shroud
of
white
stuck
all
with
yew
o
prepare
it
my
part
of
death
no
one
so
true
did
share
it
not
a
flower
not
a
flower
sweet
on
my
black
coffin
let
there
be
strown
not
a
friend
not
a
friend
greet
my
poor
corse
where
my
bones
shall
be
thrown
a
thousand
thousand
sighs
to
save
lay
me
o
where
sad
true
lover
never
find
my
grave
to
weep
there
theres
for
thy
pains
no
pains
sir
i
take
pleasure
in
singing
sir
ill
pay
thy
pleasure
then
truly
sir
and
pleasure
will
be
paid
one
time
or
another
give
me
now
leave
to
leave
thee
now
the
melancholy
god
protect
thee
and
the
tailor
make
thy
doublet
of
changeable
taffeta
for
thy
mind
is
a
very
opal
i
would
have
men
of
such
constancy
put
to
sea
that
their
business
might
be
everything
and
their
intent
everywhere
for
thats
it
that
always
makes
a
good
voyage
of
nothing
farewell
let
all
the
rest
give
place
once
more
cesario
get
thee
to
yond
same
sovereign
cruelty
tell
her
my
love
more
noble
than
the
world
prizes
not
quantity
of
dirty
lands
the
parts
that
fortune
hath
bestowd
upon
her
tell
her
i
hold
as
giddily
as
fortune
but
tis
that
miracle
and
queen
of
gems
that
nature
pranks
her
in
attracts
my
soul
but
if
she
cannot
love
you
sir
i
cannot
be
so
answerd
sooth
but
you
must
say
that
some
lady
as
perhaps
there
is
hath
for
your
love
as
great
a
pang
of
heart
as
you
have
for
olivia
you
cannot
love
her
you
tell
her
so
must
she
not
then
be
answerd
there
is
no
womans
sides
can
bide
the
beating
of
so
strong
a
passion
as
love
doth
give
my
heart
no
womans
heart
so
big
to
hold
so
much
they
lack
retention
alas
their
love
may
be
calld
appetite
no
motion
of
the
liver
but
the
palate
that
suffer
surfeit
cloyment
and
revolt
but
mine
is
all
as
hungry
as
the
sea
and
can
digest
as
much
make
no
compare
between
that
love
a
woman
can
bear
me
and
that
i
owe
olivia
ay
but
i
know
what
dost
thou
know
too
well
what
love
women
to
men
may
owe
in
faith
they
are
as
true
of
heart
as
we
my
father
had
a
daughter
lovd
a
man
as
it
might
be
perhaps
were
i
a
woman
i
should
your
lordship
and
whats
her
history
a
blank
my
lord
she
never
told
her
love
but
let
concealment
like
a
worm
i
the
bud
feed
on
her
damask
cheek
she
pind
in
thought
and
with
a
green
and
yellow
melancholy
she
sat
like
patience
on
a
monument
smiling
at
grief
was
not
this
love
indeed
we
men
may
say
more
swear
more
but
indeed
our
shows
are
more
than
will
for
still
we
prove
much
in
our
vows
but
little
in
our
love
but
died
thy
sister
of
her
love

boy

the
daughters
of
my
fathers

a
scruple

with
melancholy

thou
not
be
glad
to
have
the
niggardly
rascally
sheepbiter

some
notable
shame

i
have
heard

thus
near
that
should
she
fancy
it
should
be
one
of
my
complexion
besides
she
uses
me
with
a
more
exalted
respect
than
anyone
else

follows
her

overweening
rogue

him
in
the
eye
calling
my
officers
about

in
my
branched
velvet
gown
having
come
from
a

i
extend

hand
to

thus
quenching
my
familiar
smile
with
an
austere
regard
of
control
and
does

blow
o

lips
then

fortunes
having
cast

this
prerogative
of
speech
what
what
you
must
amend
your
drunkenness
out
scab
nay
patience
or
we
break
the
sinews
of
our
plot
besides
you
waste
the
treasure
of
your
time
with
a
foolish
knight
thats
me
i
warrant
you
one
sir
andrew
i
knew
twas
i
for
many
do
call
me
fool
what
employment
have
we
here
now
is
the
woodcock
near
the
gin
o
peace
and
the
spirit
of
humours
intimate
reading
aloud
to
him
by
my
life
this
is
my
ladys
hand
these
be
her
very
cs
her
us
and
her
ts
and
thus
makes
she
her
great
ps
it
is
in
contempt
of
question
her
hand
her
cs
her
us
and
her
ts
why
that
to
the
unknown
beloved
this
and
my
good
wishes
her
very
phrases
by
your
leave
wax
soft
and
the
impressure
her
lucrece
with
which
she
uses
to
seal
tis
my
lady
to
whom
should
this
be
this
wins
him
liver
and
all
jove
knows
i
love
but
who
lips
do
not
move
no
man
must
know
no
man
must
know
what
follows
the
numbers
altered
no
man
must
know
if
this
should
be
thee
malvolio
marry
hang
thee
brock
i
may
command
where
i
adore
but
silence
like
a
lucrece
knife
with
bloodless
stroke
my
heart
doth
gore
m
o
a
i
doth
sway
my
life
a
fustian
riddle
excellent
wench
say
i
m
o
a
i
doth
sway
my
life
nay
but
first
let
me
see
let
me
see
let
me
see
what
dish
o
poison
has
she
dressed
him
and
with
what
wing
the
staniel
checks
at
it
i
may
command
where
i
adore
why
she
may
command
me
i
serve
her
she
is
my
lady
why
this
is
evident
to
any
formal
capacity
there
is
no
obstruction
in
this
and
the
end
what
should
that
alphabetical
position
portend
if
i
could
make
that
resemble
something
in
me
softly
m
o
a
i
o
ay
make
up
that
he
is
now
at
a
cold
scent
sowter
will
cry
upon
t
for
all
this
though
it
be
as
rank
as
a
fox
m
malvolio
m
why
that
begins
my
name
did
not
i
say
he
would
work
it
out
the
cur
is
excellent
at
faults
m
but
then
there
is
no
consonancy
in
the
sequel
that
suffers
under
probation
a
should
follow
but
o
does
and
o
shall
end
i
hope
ay
or
ill
cudgel
him
and
make
him
cry
o
and
then
i

me
she
did
commend
my
yellow
stockings
of
late
she
did
praise
my
leg
being
crossgartered
and
in
this
she
manifests
herself
to
my
love
and
with
a
kind
of
injunction
drives
me
to
these
habits
of
her
liking
i
thank
my
stars
i
am
happy
i
will
be

in
yellow

will
do
everything
that
thou
wilt
have
me
i
will
not
give
my
part
of
this
sport
for
a
pension
of
thousands
to
be
paid
from
the
sophy
i
could
marry
this
wench
for
this
device
so
could
i
too
and
ask
no
other
dowry
with
her
but
such
another
jest
nor
i
neither
here
comes
my
noble
gullcatcher
wilt
thou
set
thy
foot
o
my
neck
or
o
mine
either
shall
i
play
my
freedom
at
traytrip
and
become
thy
bondslave
i
faith
or
i
either
why
thou
hast
put
him
in
such
a
dream
that
when
the
image
of
it
leaves
him
he
must
run
mad
nay
but
say
true
does
it
work
upon
him
like
aquavit
with
a
midwife
if
you
will
then
see
the
fruits
of
the
sport
mark
his
first
approach
before
my
lady
he
will
come
to
her
in
yellow
stockings
and
tis
a
colour
she
abhors
and
crossgartered
a
fashion
she
detests
and
he
will
smile
upon
her
which
will
now
be
so
unsuitable
to
her
disposition
being
addicted
to
a
melancholy
as
she
is
that
it
cannot
but
turn
him
into
a
notable
contempt
if
you
will
see
it
follow
me
to
the
gates
of
tartar
thou
most
excellent
devil
of
wit
ill
make
one
too
save
thee
friend
and
thy
music
dost
thou
live
by
thy
tabor
no
sir
i
live
by
the
church
art
thou
a
churchman
no
such
matter
sir
i
do
live
by
the
church
for
i
do
live
at
my
house
and
my
house
doth
stand
by
the
church
so
thou
mayst
say
the
king
lies
by
a
beggar
if
a
beggar
dwell
near
him
or
the
church
stands
by
thy
tabor
if
thy
tabor
stand
by
the
church
you
have
said
sir
to
see
this
age
a
sentence
is
but
a
cheveril
glove
to
a
good
wit
how
quickly
the
wrong
side
may
be
turned
outward
nay
thats
certain
they
that
dally
nicely
with
words
may
quickly
make
them
wanton
i
would
therefore
my
sister
had
had
no
name
sir
why
man
why
sir
her
names
a
word
and
to
dally
with
that
word
might
make
my
sister
wanton
but
indeed
words
are
very
rascals
since
bonds
disgraced
them
thy
reason
man
troth
sir
i
can
yield
you
none
without
words
and
words
are
grown
so
false
i
am
loath
to
prove
reason
with
them
i
warrant
thou
art
a
merry
fellow
and
carest
for
nothing
not
so
sir
i
do
care
for
something
but
in
my
conscience
sir
i
do
not
care
for
you
if
that
be
to
care
for
nothing
sir
i
would
it
would
make
you
invisible
art
not
thou
the

olivias
fool
no
indeed
sir
the
lady
olivia

no
folly
she
will
keep

as
like
husbands
as
pilchards
are
to
herrings
the
husbands
the
bigger
i
am
indeed
not
her
fool
but
her
corrupter
of
words

saw
thee
late
at
the
count

be
as

a
kind
of

he

observe
their
mood
on
whom
he
jests
the
quality
of
persons
and
the
time
and
like
the
haggard
check
at
every
feather
that
comes
before
his
eye
this
is
a
practice
as
full
of
labour
as
a
wise
mans
art
for
folly
that
he
wisely
shows
is
fit
but
wise

your
servant
madam
for

blanks
rather
than
filld
with
me
madam
i
come
to
whet
your
gentle
thoughts
on
his
behalf
o
by
your
leave
i
pray
you
i
bade
you
never
speak
again
of
him
but
would
you
undertake
another
suit
i
had
rather
hear
you
to
solicit
that
than
music
from
the
spheres
dear
lady
give
me
leave
beseech
you
i
did
send
after
the
last
enchantment
you
did
here
a
ring
in
chase
of
you
so
did
i
abuse
myself
my
servant
and
i
fear
me
you
under
your
hard
construction
must
i
sit
to
force
that
on
you
in
a
shameful
cunning
which
you
knew
none
of
yours
what
might
you
think
have
you
not
set
mine
honour
at
the
stake
and
baited
it
with
all
th
unmuzzled
thoughts
that
tyrannous
heart
can
think
to
one
of
your
receiving
enough
is
shown
a
cypress
not
a
bosom
hideth
my
heart
so
let
me
hear
you
speak
i
pity
you
thats
a
degree
to
love
no
not
a
grize
for
tis
a
vulgar
proof
that
very
oft
we
pity
enemies
why
then
methinks
tis
time
to
smile
again
o
world
how
apt
the
poor
are
to
be
proud
if
one
should
be
a
prey
how
much
the
better
to
fall
before
the
lion
than
the
wolf
the
clock
upbraids
me
with
the
waste
of
time
be
not
afraid
good
youth
i
will
not
have
you
and
yet
when
wit
and
youth
is
come
to
harvest
your
wife
is
like
to
reap
a
proper
man
there
lies
your
way
due
west
then
westwardho
grace
and
good
disposition
attend
your
ladyship
youll
nothing
madam
to
my
lord
by
me
stay
i
prithee
tell
me
what
thou
thinkst
of
me
that
you
do
think
you
are
not
what
you
are
if
i
think
so
i
think
the
same
of
you
then
think
you
right
i
am
not
what
i
am
i
would
you
were
as
i
would
have
you
be
would
it
be
better
madam
than
i
am
i
wish
it
might
for
now
i
am
your
fool
o
what
a
deal
of
scorn
looks
beautiful
in
the
contempt
and
anger
of
his
lip
a
murderous
guilt
shows
not
itself
more
soon
than
love
that
would
seem
hid
loves
night
is
noon
cesario
by
the
roses
of
the
spring
by
maidhood
honour
truth
and
every
thing
i
love
thee
so
that
maugre
all
thy
pride
nor
wit
nor
reason
can
my
passion
hide
do
not
extort
thy
reasons
from
this
clause
for
that
i
woo
thou
therefore
hast
no
cause
but
rather
reason
thus
with
reason
fetter
love
sought
is
good
but
givn
unsought
is
better
by
innocence
i
swear
and
by
my
youth
i
have
one
heart
one
bosom
and
one
truth
and
that
no
woman
has
nor
never
none
shall
mistress
be
of
it
save
i
alone
and
so
adieu
good
madam
never
more
will
i
my
masters
tears
to
you
deplore
yet
come
again
for
thou
perhaps
mayst
move
that
heart
which
now
abhors
to
like
his
love
no
faith
ill
not
stay
a
jot
longer
thy
reason
dear
venom
give
thy
reason
you
must
needs
yield
your
reason
sir
andrew
marry
i
saw
your
niece
do
more
favours
to
the
counts
servingman
than
ever
she
bestowed
upon
me
i
sawt
i
the
orchard
did
she
see
thee
the
while
old
boy
tell
me
that
as
plain
as
i
see
you
now
this
was
a
great
argument
of
love
in
her
toward
you
slight
will
you
make
an
ass
o
me
i
will
prove
it
legitimate
sir
upon
the
oaths
of
judgment
and
reason
and
they
have
been
grandjurymen
since
before
noah
was
a
sailor
she
did
show
favour
to
the
youth
in
your
sight
only
to
exasperate
you
to
awake
your
dormouse
valour
to
put
fire
in
your
heart
and
brimstone
in
your
liver
you
should
then
have
accosted
her
and
with
some
excellent
jests
firenew
from
the
mint
you
should
have
banged
the
youth
into
dumbness
this
was
looked
for
at
your
hand
and
this
was
balked
the
double
gilt
of
this
opportunity
you
let
time
wash
off
and
you
are
now
sailed
into
the
north
of
my
ladys
opinion
where
you
will
hang
like
an
icicle
on
a
dutchmans
beard
unless
you
do
redeem
it
by
some
laudable
attempt
either
of
valour
or
policy
ant
be
any
way
it
must
be
with
valour
for
policy
i
hate
i
had
as
lief
be
a
brownist
as
a
politician
why
then
build
me
thy
fortunes
upon
the
basis
of
valour
challenge
me
the
counts
youth
to
fight
with
him
hurt
him
in
eleven
places
my
niece
shall
take
note
of
it
and
assure
thyself
there
is
no
lovebroker
in
the
world
can
more
prevail
in
mans
commendation
with
woman
than
report
of
valour
there
is
no
way
but
this
sir
andrew
will
either
of
you
bear
me
a
challenge
to
him
go
write
it
in
a
martial
hand
be
curst
and
brief
it
is
no
matter
how
witty
so
it
be
eloquent
and
full
of
invention
taunt
him
with
the
licence
of
ink
if
thou
thoust
him
some
thrice
it
shall
not
be
amiss
and
as
many
lies
as
will
lie
in
thy
sheet
of
paper
although
the
sheet
were
big
enough
for
the
bed
of
ware
in
england
set
em
down
go
about
it
let
there
be
gall
enough
in
thy
ink
though
thou
write
with
a
goosepen
no
matter
about
it
where
shall
i
find
you
well
call
thee
at
the
cubiculo
go
this
is
a
dear
manakin
to
you
sir
toby
i
have
been
dear
to
him
lad
some
two
thousand
strong
or
so
we
shall
have
a
rare
letter
from
him
but
youll
not
deliver
it
never
trust
me
then
and
by
all
means
stir
on
the
youth
to
an
answer
i
think
oxen
and
wainropes
cannot
hale
them
together
for
andrew
if
he
were
opened
and
you
find
so
much
blood
in
his
liver
as
will
clog
the
foot
of
a
flea
ill
eat
the
rest
of
the
anatomy
and
his
opposite
the
youth
bears
in
his
visage
no
great
presage
of
cruelty
look
where
the
youngest
wren
of
nine
comes
if
you
desire
the
spleen
and
will
laugh
yourselves
into
stitches
follow
me
yond
gull
malvolio
is
turned
heathen
a
very
renegado
for
there
is
no
christian
that
means
to
be
saved
by
believing
rightly
can
ever
believe
such
impossible
passages
of
grossness
hes
in
yellow
stockings
and
crossgartered
most
villanously
like
a
pedant
that
keeps
a
school
i
the
church
i
have
dogged
him
like
his
murderer
he
does
obey
every
point
of
the
letter
that
i
dropped
to
betray
him
he
does
smile
his
face
into
more
lines
than
are
in
the
new
map
with
the
augmentation
of
the
indies
you
have
not
seen
such
a
thing
as
tis
i
can
hardly
forbear
hurling
things
at
him
i
know
my
lady
will
strike
him
if
she
do
hell
smile
and
taket
for
a
great
favour
come
bring
us
bring
us
where
he
is
i
would
not
by
my
will
have
troubled
you
but
since
you
make
your
pleasure
of
your
pains
i
will
no
further
chide
you
i
could
not
stay
behind
you
my
desire
more
sharp
than
filed
steel
did
spur
me
forth
and
not
all
love
to
see
you
though
so
much
as
might
have
drawn
one
to
a
longer
voyage
but
jealousy
what
might
befall
your
travel
being
skilless
in
these
parts
which
to
a
stranger
unguided
and
unfriended
often
prove
rough
and
unhospitable
my
willing
love
the
rather
by
these
arguments
of
fear
set
forth
in
your
pursuit
my
kind
antonio
i
can
no
other
answer
make
but
thanks
and
thanks
and
ever
thanks

uncurrent
pay

our
eyes
with
the
memorials
and
the
things
of
fame
that

renown

city

youd
pardon
me
i
do
not
without
danger
walk
these
streets
once
in
a
seafight
gainst
the
count
his
galleys
i
did
some
service
of
such
note
indeed
that
were
i
taen
here
it
would
scarce
be
answerd
belike
you
slew
great
number
of
his
people
the
offence
is
not
of
such
a
bloody
nature
albeit
the
quality
of
the
time
and
quarrel
might
well
have
given
us
bloody
argument
it
might
have
since
been
answerd
in
repaying
what
we
took
from
them
which
for
traffics
sake
most
of
our
city
did
only
myself
stood
out
for
which
if
i
be
lapsed
in
this
place
i
shall
pay
dear
do
not

walk
too
open

loud

well
for
a
servant
with
my
fortunes
where

malvolio

in
very
strange
manner
he
is
sure
possessd

some
obstruction
in

this
crossgartering

what
of
that
if

the
eye
of
one

is
with

dost
thou
man

with
the
letter

purpose

may
appear
stubborn
to
him
for
she
incites
me
to
that
in
the
letter
cast
thy
humble
slough
says
she
be
opposite
with
a
kinsman
surly
with
servants
let
thy
tongue
tang
with
arguments
of
state

thyself
into
the
trick
of
singularity

consequently
sets
down
the
manner
how
as
a
sad
face
a
reverend
carriage
a
slow
tongue

the
habit
of

shall
know
more
hereafter
ist
possible
if
this
were
played
upon
a
stage
now
i
could
condemn
it
as
an
improbable
fiction
his
very
genius
hath
taken
the
infection
of
the
device
man
nay
pursue
him
now
lest
the
device
take
air
and
taint
why
we
shall
make
him
mad
indeed
the
house
will
be
the
quieter
come
well
have
him
in
a
dark
room
and
bound
my
niece
is
already
in
the
belief
that
hes
mad
we
may
carry
it
thus
for
our
pleasure
and
his
penance
till
our
very
pastime
tired
out
of
breath
prompt
us
to
have
mercy
on
him
at
which
time
we
will
bring
the
device
to
the
bar
and
crown
thee
for
a
finder
of
madmen
but
see
but
see
more
matter
for
a
may
morning
heres
the
challenge
read
it
i
warrant
theres
vinegar
and
pepper
int
ist
so
saucy
ay
ist
i
warrant
him
do
but
read
give
me
youth
whatsoever
thou
art
thou
art
but
a
scurvy
fellow
good
and
valiant
wonder
not
nor
admire
not
in
thy
mind
why
i
do
call
thee
so
for
i
will
show
thee
no
reason
fort
a
good
note
that
keeps
you
from
the
blow
of
the
law
thou
comest
to
the
lady
olivia
and
in
my
sight
she
uses
thee
kindly
but
thou
liest
in
thy
throat
that
is
not
the
matter
i
challenge
thee
for
very
brief
and
to
exceeding
good
sense
less
i
will
waylay
thee
going
home
where
if
it
be
thy
chance
to
kill
me
good
thou
killest
me
like
a
rogue
and
a
villain
still
you
keep
o
the
windy
side
of
the
law
good
fare
thee
well
and
god
have
mercy
upon
one
of
our
souls
he
may
have
mercy
upon
mine
but
my
hope
is
better
and
so
look
to
thyself
thy
friend
as
thou
usest
him
and
thy
sworn
enemy
if
this
letter
move
him
not
his
legs
cannot
ill
givet
him
you
may
have
very
fit
occasion
for
fort
he
is
now
in
some
commerce
with
my
lady
and
will
by
and
by
depart
go
sir
andrew
scout
me
for
him
at
the
corner
of
the
orchard
like
a
bumbaily
so
soon
as
ever
thou
seest
him
draw
and
as
thou
drawest
swear
horrible
for
it
comes
to
pass
oft
that
a
terrible
oath
with
a
swaggering
accent
sharply
twanged
off
gives
manhood
more
approbation
than
ever
proof
itself
would
have
earned
him
away
nay
let
me
alone
for
swearing
now
will
not
i
deliver
his
letter
for
the
behaviour
of
the
young
gentleman
gives
him
out
to
be
of
good
capacity
and
breeding
his
employment
between
his
lord
and
my
niece
confirms
no
less
therefore
this
letter
being
so
excellently
ignorant
will
breed
no
terror
in
the
youth
he
will
find
it
comes
from
a
clodpole
but
sir
i
will
deliver
his
challenge
by
word
of
mouth
set
upon
aguecheek
a
notable
report
of
valour
and
drive
the
gentleman
as
i
know
his
youth
will
aptly
receive
it
into
a
most
hideous
opinion
of
his
rage
skill
fury
and
impetuosity
this
will
so
fright
them
both
that
they
will
kill
one
another
by
the
look
like
cockatrices
here
he
comes
with
your
niece
give
them
way
till
he
take
leave
and
presently
after
him
i
will
meditate
the
while
upon
some
horrid
message
for
a
challenge
i
have
said
too
much
unto
a
heart
of
stone
and
laid
mine
honour
too
unchary
out
theres
something
in
me
that
reproves
my
fault
but
such
a
headstrong
potent
fault
it
is
that
it
but
mocks
reproof
with
the
same
haviour
that
your
passion
bears
goes
on
my
masters
griefs
here
wear
this
jewel
for
me
tis
my
picture
refuse
it
not
it
hath
no
tongue
to
vex
you
and
i
beseech
you
come
again
tomorrow
what
shall
you
ask
of
me
that
ill
deny
that
honour
savd

asking

nothing
but
this
your
true
love
for
my
master
how
with
mine
honour
may
i
give
him
that
which
i
have
given
to
you
i
will
acquit
you
well
come
again
tomorrow
fare
thee
well
a
fiend
like
thee
might
bear
my
soul
to
hell
gentleman
god
save
thee
and
you
sir
that
defence
thou
hast
betake
thee
tot
of
what
nature
the
wrongs
are
thou
hast
done
him
i
know
not
but
thy
intercepter
full
of
despite
bloody
as
the
hunter
attends
thee
at
the
orchardend
dismount
thy
tuck
be
yare
in
thy
preparation
for
thy
assailant
is
quick
skilful
and
deadly
you
mistake
sir
i
am
sure
no
man
hath
any
quarrel
to
me
my
remembrance
is
very
free
and
clear
from
any
image
of
offence
done
to
any
man
youll
find
it
otherwise
i
assure
you
therefore
if
you
hold
your
life
at
any
price
betake
you
to
your
guard
for
your
opposite
hath
in
him
what
youth
strength
skill
and
wrath
can
furnish
man
withal
i
pray
you
sir
what
is
he
he
is
knight
dubbed
with
unhatched
rapier
and
on
carpet
consideration
but
he
is
a
devil
in
private
brawl
souls
and
bodies
hath
he
divorced
three
and
his
incensement
at
this
moment
is
so
implacable
that
satisfaction
can
be
none
but
by
pangs
of
death
and
sepulchre
hob
nob
is
his
word
givet
or
taket
i
will
return
again
into
the
house
and
desire
some
conduct
of
the
lady
i
am
no
fighter
i
have
heard
of
some
kind
of
men
that
put
quarrels
purposely
on
others
to
taste
their
valour
belike
this
is
a
man
of
that
quirk
sir
no
his
indignation
derives
itself
out
of
a
very
competent
injury
therefore
get
you
on
and
give
him
his
desire
back
you
shall
not
to
the
house
unless
you
undertake
that
with
me
which
with
as
much
safety
you
might
answer
him
therefore
on
or
strip
your
sword
stark
naked
for
meddle
you
must
thats
certain
or
forswear
to
wear
iron
about
you
this
is
as
uncivil
as
strange
i
beseech
you
do
me
this
courteous
office
as
to
know
of
the
knight
what
my
offence
to
him
is
it
is
something
of
my
negligence
nothing
of
my
purpose
i
will
do
so
signior
fabian
stay
you
by
this
gentleman
till
my
return
pray
you
sir
do
you
know
of
this
matter
i
know
the
knight
is
incensed
against
you
even
to
a
mortal
arbitrement
but
nothing
of
the
circumstance
more
i
beseech
you
what
manner
of
man
is
he
nothing
of
that
wonderful
promise
to
read
him
by
his
form
as
you
are
like
to
find
him
in
the
proof
of
his
valour
he
is
indeed
sir
the
most
skilful
bloody
and
fatal
opposite
that
you
could
possibly
have
found
in
any
part
of
illyria
will

walk
towards
him

will
make
your
peace

gives
me
the
stuck
in
with
such
a
mortal
motion
that
it
is
inevitable
and
on
the
answer

pays
you
as
surely
as
your
feet
hit
the
ground
they
step
on
they
say
he
has

of
pythagoras
ere

kill
a
woodcock

the
air
that

glorious
sun
this
pearl

me
i
do
feelt
and
seet
and
though
tis
wonder
that
enwraps
me
thus
yet
tis
not
madness
wheres
antonio
then
i
could
not
find
him
at
the
elephant
yet
there
he
was
and
there
i
found
this
credit
that
he
did
range
the
town
to
seek
me
out
his
counsel
now
might
do
me
golden
service
for
though
my
soul
disputes
well
with
my
sense
that
this
may
be
some
error
but
no
madness
yet
doth
this
accident
and
flood
of
fortune
so
far
exceed
all
instance
all
discourse
that
i
am
ready
to
distrust
mine
eyes
and
wrangle
with
my
reason
that
persuades
me
to
any
other
trust
but
that
i
am
mad
or
else
the
ladys
mad
yet
if
twere
so
she
could
not
sway
her
house
command
her
followers
take
and
give
back
affairs
and
their
dispatch
with
such
a
smooth
discreet
and
stable
bearing
as
i
perceive
she
does
theres
something
int
that
is
deceivable
but
here
the
lady
comes
blame
not
this
haste
of
mine
if
you
mean
well
now
go
with
me
and
with
this
holy
man
into
the
chantry
by
there
before
him
and
underneath
that
consecrated
roof
plight
me
the
full
assurance
of
your
faith
that
my
most
jealous
and
too
doubtful
soul
may
live
at
peace
he
shall
conceal
it
whiles
you
are
willing
it
shall
come
to
note
what
time
we
will
our
celebration
keep
according
to
my
birth
what
do
you
say
ill
follow
this
good
man
and

will
be
true

nap

will
awake

anon
here

the
man
sir
that
did
rescue
me
that
face
of
his
i
do
remember
well
yet
when
i
saw
it
last
it
was
besmeard
as
black
as
vulcan
in
the
smoke
of
war
a
bawbling
vessel
was
he
captain
of
for
shallow
draught
and
hulk
unprizable
with
which
such
scathful
grapple
did
he
make
with
the
most
noble
bottom
of
our
fleet
that
very
envy
and
the
tongue
of
loss
cried
fame
and
honour
on
him
whats
the
matter
orsino
this
is
that
antonio
that
took
the
ph
nix
and
her
fraught
from
candy
and
this
is
he
that
did
the
tiger
board
when
your
young
nephew
titus
lost
his
leg
here
in
the
streets
desperate
of
shame
and
state
in
private
brabble
did
we
apprehend
him
he
did
me
kindness
sir
drew
on
my
side
but
in
conclusion
put
strange
speech
upon
me
i
know
not
what
twas
but
distraction
notable
pirate
thou
saltwater
thief
what
foolish
boldness
brought
thee
to
their
mercies
whom
thou
in
terms
so
bloody
and
so
dear
hast
made
thine
enemies
orsino
noble
sir
be
pleasd
that
i
shake
off
these
names
you
give
me
antonio
never
yet
was
thief
or
pirate
though
i
confess
on
base
and
ground
enough
orsinos
enemy
a
witchcraft
drew
me
hither
that
most
ingrateful
boy
there
by
your
side
from
the
rude
seas
enragd
and
foamy
mouth
did
i
redeem
a
wrack
past
hope
he
was
his
life
i
gave
him
and
did
thereto
add
my
love
without
retention
or
restraint
all
his
in
dedication
for
his
sake
did
i
expose
myself
pure
for
his
love
into
the
danger
of
this
adverse
town
drew
to
defend
him
when
he
was
beset
where
being
apprehended
his
false
cunning
not
meaning
to
partake
with
me
in
danger
taught
him
to
face
me
out
of
his
acquaintance
and
grew
a
twenty
years
removed
thing
while
one
would
wink
denied
me
mine
own
purse
which
i
had
recommended
to
his
use
not
half
an
hour
before
how
can
this
be
when

he
to
this
town

natural
perspective
that

not
antonio
o
my
dear
antonio
how
have
the
hours
rackd
and
torturd
me
since
i
have
lost
thee
sebastian
are
you
fearst
thou
that
antonio
how
have
you
made
division
of
yourself
an
apple
cleft
in
two
is
not
more
twin
than
these
two
creatures
which
is
sebastian
most
wonderful
do
i
stand
there
i
never
had
a
brother
nor
can
there
be
that
deity
in
my
nature
of
here
and
every
where
i
had
a
sister
whom
the
blind
waves
and
surges
have
devourd
of
charity
what
kin
are
you
to
me
what
countryman
what
name
what
parentage
of
messaline
sebastian
was
my
father
such
a
sebastian
was
my
brother
too
so
went
he
suited
to
his
watery
tomb
if
spirits
can
assume
both
form
and
suit
you
come
to
fright
us
a
spirit
i
am
indeed
but
am
in
that
dimension
grossly
clad
which
from
the
womb
i
did
participate
were
you
a
woman
as
the
rest
goes
even
i
should
my
tears
let
fall
upon
your
cheek
and
say
thrice
welcome
drowned
viola
my
father
had
a
mole
upon
his
brow
and
so
had
mine
and
died
that
day
when
viola
from
her
birth
had
numberd
thirteen
years
o
that
record
is
lively
in
my
soul
he
finished
indeed
his
mortal
act
that
day
that
made
my
sister
thirteen
years
if
nothing
lets
to
make
us
happy
both
but
this
my
masculine
usurpd
attire
do
not
embrace
me
till
each
circumstance
of
place
time
fortune
do
cohere
and
jump
that
i
am
viola
which
to
confirm
ill
bring
you
to
a
captain
in
this
town
where
lie
my
maiden
weeds
by
whose
gentle
help
i
was
preservd
to
serve
this
noble
count
all
the
occurrence
of
my
fortune
since
hath
been
between
this
lady
and
this
lord
so
comes
it
lady
you
have
been
mistook
but
nature
to
her
bias
drew
in
that
you
would
have
been
contracted
to
a
maid
nor
are
you
therein
by
my
life
deceivd
you
are
betrothd
both
to
a
maid
and
man
be
not
amazd
right
noble
is
his
blood
if
this
be
so
as
yet
the
glass
seems
true
i
shall
have
share
in
this
most
happy
wrack
boy
thou
hast
said
to
me
a
thousand
times
thou
never
shouldst
love
woman
like
to
me
and
all
those
sayings
will
i
overswear
and
all
those
swearings
keep
as
true
in
soul
as
doth
that
orbed
continent
the
fire
that
severs
day
from
night
give
me
thy
hand
and
let
me
see
thee
in
thy
womans
weeds
the
captain
that
did
bring
me
first
on
shore

a
letter
to

semblance

put
on
with

alliance

so
please
you
here
at
my
house
and
at
my
proper
cost
madam
i
am
most
apt
to
embrace
your
offer
your
master
quits
you
and
for
your
service
done
him
so
much
against
the
mettle
of
your
sex
so
far
beneath
your
soft
and
tender
breeding
and
since
you
calld
me
master
for
so
long
here
is
my
hand
you
shall
from
this
time
be
your
masters
mistress
a
sister
you
are
she
is
this
the
madman
ay
my
lord
this
same
how
now
malvolio
madam
you
have
done
me
wrong
notorious
wrong
have
i
malvolio
no
lady
you
have
pray
you
peruse
that
letter
you
must
not
now
deny
it
is
your
hand
write
from
it
if
you
can
in
hand
or
phrase
or
say
tis
not
your
seal
nor
your
invention
you
can
say
none
of
this
well
grant
it
then
and
tell
me
in
the
modesty
of
honour
why
you
have
given
me
such
clear
lights
of
favour
bade
me
come
smiling
and
crossgarterd
to
you
to
put
on
yellow
stockings
and
to
frown
upon
sir
toby
and
the
lighter
people
and
acting
this
in
an
obedient
hope
why
have
you
sufferd
me
to
be
imprisond
kept
in
a
dark
house
visited
by
the
priest
and
made
the
most
notorious
geck
and
gull
that
eer
invention
playd
on
tell
me
why
alas
malvolio
this
is
not
my
writing
though
i
confess
much
like
the
character
but
out
of
question
tis
marias
hand
and
now
i
do
bethink
me
it
was
she
first
told
me
thou
wast
mad
then
camst
in
smiling
and
in
such
forms
which
here
were
presupposd
upon
thee
in
the
letter
prithee
be
content
this
practice
hath
most
shrewdly
passd
upon
thee
but
when
we
know
the
grounds
and
authors
of
it
thou
shalt
be
both
the
plaintiff
and
the
judge
of
thine
own
cause
good
madam
hear
me
speak
and
let
no
quarrel
nor
no
brawl
to
come
taint
the
condition
of
this
present
hour
which
i
have
wonderd
at
in
hope
it
shall
not
most
freely
i
confess
myself
and
toby
set
this
device
against
malvolio
here
upon
some
stubborn
and
uncourteous
parts
we
had
conceivd
against
him
maria
writ
the
letter
at
sir
tobys
great
importance
in
recompense
whereof
he
hath
married
her
how
with
a
sportful
malice
it
was
followd
may
rather
pluck
on
laughter
than
revenge
if
that
the
injuries
be
justly
weighd
that
have
on
both
sides
past
alas
poor
fool
how
have
they
baffled
thee
why
some
are
born
great
some
achieve
greatness
and
some
have
greatness
thrown
upon
them
i
was
one
sir
in
this
interlude
one
sir
topas
sir
but
thats
all
one
by
the
lord
fool
i
am
not
mad
but
do
you
remember
madam
why
laugh
you
at
such
a
barren
rascal
an
you
smile
not
hes
gagged
and
thus
the
whirligig
of
time
brings
in
his
revenges
ill
be
revengd
on
the
whole
pack
of
you
he
hath
been
most
notoriously
abusd
pursue
him
and
entreat
him
to
a
peace
he
hath
not
told
us
of
the
captain
yet
when
that
is
known
and
golden
time
convents
a
solemn
combination
shall
be
made
of
our
dear
souls
meantime
sweet
sister
we
will
not
part
from
hence
cesario
come
for
so
you
shall
be
while
you
are
a
man
but
when
in
other
habits
you
are
seen
orsinos
mistress
and
his
fancys
queen
when
that
i
was
and
a
little
tiny
boy
with
hey
ho
the
wind
and
the
rain
a
foolish
thing
was
but
a
toy
for
the
rain
it
raineth
every
day
but
when
i
came
to
mans
estate
with
hey
ho
the
wind
and
the
rain
gainst
knaves
and
thieves
men
shut
their
gates
for
the
rain
it
raineth
every
day
but
when
i
came
alas
to
wive
with
hey
ho
the
wind
and
the
rain
by
swaggering
could
i
never
thrive
for
the
rain
it
raineth
every
day
but
when
i
came
unto
my
beds
with
hey
ho
the
wind
and
the
rain
with
tosspots
still
had
drunken
heads
for
the
rain
it
raineth
every
day
a
great
while
ago
the
world
begun
with
hey
ho
the
wind
and
the
rain
but
thats
all
one
our
play
is
done
and
well
strive
to
please
you
every
day
the
famous
history
of
the
life
of
king
henry
viii
i
come
no
more
to
make
you
laugh
things
now
that
bear
a
weighty
and
a
serious
brow
sad
high
and
working
full
of
state
and
woe
such
noble
scenes
as
draw
the
eye
to
flow
we
now
present
those
that
can
pity
here
may
if
they
think
it
well
let
fall
a
tear
the
subject
will
deserve
it
such
as
give
their
money
out
of
hope
they
may
believe
may
here
find
truth
too
those
that
come
to
see
only
a
show
or
two
and
so
agree
the
play
may
pass
if
they
be
still
and
willing
ill
undertake
may
see
away
their
shilling
richly
in
two
short
hours
only
they
that
come
to
hear
a
merry
bawdy
play
a
noise
of
targets
or
to
see
a
fellow
in
a
long
molley
coat
guarded
with
yellow
will
be
deceivd
for
gentle
hearers
know
to
rank
our
chosen
truth
with
such
a
show
as
fool
and
fight
is
besides
forfeiting
our
own
brains
and
the
opinion
that
we
bring
to
make
that
only
true
we
now
intend
will
leave
us
never
an
understanding
friend
therefore
for
goodness
sake
and
as
you
are
known
the
first
and
happiest
hearers
of
the
town
be
sad
as
we
would
make
ye
think
ye
see
the
very
persons
of
our
noble
story
as
they
were
living
think
you
see
them
great
and
followd
with
the
general
throng
and
sweat
of
thousand
friends
then
in
a
moment
see
how
soon
this
mightiness
meets
misery
and
if
you
can
be
merry
then
ill
say
a
man
may
weep
upon
his
wedding
day
good
morrow
and
well
met
how
have
you
done
since
last
we
saw
in
france
i
thank
your
grace
healthful
and
ever
since
a
fresh
admirer
of
what
i
saw
there
an
untimely
ague
stayd
me
a
prisoner
in
my
chamber
when
those
suns
of
glory
those
two
lights
of
men
met
in
the
vale
of
andren
twixt
guynes
and
arde
i
was
then
present
saw
them
salute
on
horseback
beheld
them
when
they
lighted
how
they
clung
in
their
embracement
as
they
grew
together
which
had
they
what
four
thrond
ones
could
have
weighd
such
a
compounded
one
all
the
whole
time
i
was
my
chambers
prisoner
then
you
lost
the
view
of
earthly
glory
men
might
say
till
this
time
pomp
was
single
but
now
married
to
one
above
itself
each
following
day
became
the
next
days
master
till
the
last
made
former
wonders
its
today
the
french
all
clinquant
all
in
gold
like
heathen
gods
shone
down
the
english
and
tomorrow
they
made
britain
india
every
man
that
stood
showd
like
a
mine
their
dwarfish
pages
were
as
cherubins
all
gilt
the
madams
too
not
usd
to
toil
did
almost
sweat
to
bear
the
pride
upon
them
that
their
very
labour
was
to
them
as
a
painting
now
this
masque
was
cried
incomparable
and
the
ensuing
night
made
it
a
fool
and
beggar
the
two
kings
equal
in
lustre
were
now
best
now
worst
as
presence
did
present
them
him
in
eye
still
him
in
praise
and
being
present
both
twas
said
they
saw
but
one
and
no
discerner
durst
wag
his
tongue
in
censure
when
these
suns
for
so
they
phrase
em
by
their
heralds
challengd
the
noble
spirits
to
arms
they
did
perform
beyond
thoughts
compass
that
former
fabulous
story
being
now
seen
possible
enough
got
credit
that
bevis
was
believd
o
you
go
far
as
i
belong
to
worship
and
affect
in
honour
honesty
the
tract
of
every
thing
would
by
a
good
discourser
lose
some
life
which
actions
self
was
tongue
to
all
was
royal
to
the
disposing
of
it
nought
rebelld
order
gave
each
thing
view
the
office
did
distinctly
his
full
function
who
did
guide
i
mean
who
set
the
body
and
the
limbs
of
this
great
sport
together
as
you
guess
one
certes
that
promises
no
element
in
such
a
business
i
pray
you
who
my
lord
all
this
was
orderd
by
the
good
discretion
of
the
right
reverend
cardinal
of
york
the
devil
speed
him
no
mans
pie
is
freed
from
his
ambitious
finger
what
had
he
to
do
in
these
fierce
vanities
i
wonder
that
such
a
keech
can
with
his
very
bulk
take
up
the
rays
o
the
beneficial
sun
and
keep
it
from
the
earth
surely
sir
theres
in
him
stuff
that
puts
him
to
these
ends
for
being
not
proppd
by
ancestry
whose
grace
chalks
successors
their
way
nor
calld
upon
for
high
feats
done
to
the
crown
neither
allied
to
eminent
assistants
but
spiderlike
out
of
his
selfdrawing
web
he
gives
us
note
the
force
of
his
own
merit
makes
his
way
a
gift
that
heaven
gives
for
him
which
buys
a
place
next
to
the
king
i
cannot
tell
what
heaven
hath
given
him
let
some
graver
eye
pierce
into
that
but
i
can
see
his
pride
peep
through
each
part
of
him
whence
has
he
that
if
not
from
hell
the
devil
is
a
niggard
or
has
given
all
before
and
he
begins
a
new
hell
in
himself
why
the
devil
upon
this
french
goingout
took
he
upon
him
without
the
privity
o
the
king
to
appoint
who
should
attend
on
him
he
makes
up
the
file
of
all
the
gentry
for
the
most
part
such
to
whom
as
great
a
charge
as
little
honour
he
meant
to
lay
upon
and
his
own
letter
the
honourable
board
of
council
out
must
fetch
him
in
he
papers
i
do
know
kinsmen
of
mine
three
at
the
least
that
have
by
this
so
sickend
their
estates
that
never
they
shall
abound
as
formerly
o
many
have
broke
their
backs
with
laying
manors
on
em
for
this
great
journey
what
did
this
vanity
but
minister
communication
of
a
most
poor
issue
grievingly
i
think
the
peace
between
the
french
and
us
not
values
the
cost
that
did
conclude
it
every
man
after
the
hideous
storm
that
followd
was
a
thing
inspird
and
not
consulting
broke
into
a
general
prophecy
that
this
tempest
dashing
the
garment
of
this
peace
aboded
the
sudden
breach
ont
which
is
budded
out
for
france
hath
flawd
the
league
and
hath
attachd
our
merchants
goods
at
bourdeaux
is
it
therefore
the
ambassador
is
silencd
marry
ist
a
proper
title
of
a
peace
and
purchasd
at
a
superfluous
rate
why
all
this
business
our
reverend
cardinal
carried
like
it
your
grace
the
state
takes
notice
of
the
private
difference
betwixt
you
and
the
cardinal
i
advise
you
and
take
it
from
a
heart
that
wishes
towards
you
honour
and
plenteous
safety
that
you
read
the
cardinals
malice
and
his
potency
together
to
consider
further
that
what
his
high
hatred
would
effect
wants
not
a
minister
in
his
power
you
know
his
nature
that
hes
revengeful
and
i
know
his
sword
hath
a
sharp
edge
its
long
and
t
may
be
said
it
reaches
far
and
where
twill
not
extend
thither
he
darts
it
bosom
up
my
counsel
youll
find
it
wholesome
lo
where

sir
i
am
thankful
to
you
and
ill
go
along
by
your
prescription
but
this
topproud
fellow
whom
from
the
flow
of
gall
i
name
not
but
from
sincere
motions
by
intelligence
and
proofs
as
clear
as
founts
in
july
when
we
see
each
grain
of
gravel
i
do
know
to
be
corrupt
and
treasonous
say
not
treasonous
to
the
king
ill
sayt
and
make
my
vouch
as
strong
as
shore
of
rock
attend
this
holy
fox
or
wolf
or
both
for
he
is
equal
ravenous
as
he
is
subtle
and
as
prone
to
mischief
as
able
to
perform
t
his
mind
and
place
infecting
one
another
yea
reciprocally
only
to
show
his
pomp
as
well
in
france
as
here
at
home
suggests
the
king
our
master
to
this
last
costly
treaty
the
interview
that
swallowd
so
much
treasure
and
like
a
glass
did
break
i
the
rinsing
faith
and
so
it
did
praygive
me
favour
sir
this
cunning
cardinal
the
articles
o
the
combination
drew
as
himself
pleasd
and
they
were
ratified
as
he
cried
thus
let
be
to
as
much
end
as
give
a
crutch
to
the
dead
but
our
countcardinal
has
done
this
and
tis
well
for
worthy
wolsey
who
cannot
err
he
did
it
now
this
follows
which
as
i
take
it
is
a
kind
of
puppy
to
the
old
dam
treason
charles
the
emperor
under
pretence
to
see
the
queen
his
aunt
for
twas
indeed
his
colour
but
he
came
to
whisper
wolsey
here
makes
visitation
his
fears
were
that
the
interview
betwixt
england
and
france
might
through
their
amity
breed
him
some
prejudice
for
from
this
league
peepd
harms
that
menacd
him
he
privily
deals
with
our
cardinal
and
as
i
trow
which
i
do
well
for
i
am
sure
the
emperor
paid
ere
he
promisd
whereby
his
suit
was
granted
ere
it
was
askd
but
when
the
way
was
made
and
pavd
with
gold
the
emperor
thus
desird
that
he
would
please
to
alter
the
kings
course
and
break
the
foresaid
peace
let
the
king
know
as
soon
he
shall
by
me
that
thus
the
cardinal
does
buy
and
sell
his
honour
as
he
pleases
and
for
his
own
advantage
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
of
him
and
could
wish
he
were
something
mistaken
in
t
no
not
a
syllable

been
commissions
sent
down
among

which
hath
flawd
the
heart
of
all
their
loyalties
wherein
although
my
good
lord
cardinal
they
vent
reproaches
most
bitterly
on

exactions

no
more
than
others
but
you
frame
things
that
are
known
alike
which
are
not
wholesome
to
those
which
would
not
know
them
and
yet
must
perforce
be
their
acquaintance
these
exactions
whereof
my
sovreign
would
have
note
they
are
most
pestilent
to
the
hearing
and
to
bear
em
the
back
is
sacrifice
to
the
load
they
say
they
are
devisd
by
you
or
else
you
suffer
too
hard
an
exclamation
still
exaction
the
nature
of
it
in
what
kind
lets
know
is
this
exaction
i
am
much
too
venturous
in
tempting
of
your
patience
but
am
boldend
under
your
promisd
pardon
the
subjects
grief
comes
through
commissions
which
compel
from
each
the
sixth
part
of
his
substance
to
be
levied
without
delay
and
the
pretence
for
this
is
namd
your
wars
in
france
this
makes
bold
mouths
tongues
spit
their
duties
out
and
cold
hearts
freeze
allegiance
in
them
their
curses
now
live
where
their
prayers
did
and
its
come
to
pass
this
tractable
obedience
is
a
slave
to
each
incensed
will
i
would
your
highness
would
give
it
quick
consideration
for
there
is
no
primer
business
by
my
life
this
is
against
our
pleasure
and
for
me
i
have
no
further
gone
in
this
than
by
a
single
voice
and
that
not
passd
me
but
by
learned
approbation
of
the
judges
if
i
am
traducd
by
ignorant
tongues
which
neither
know
my
faculties
nor
person
yet
will
be
the
chronicles
of
my
doing
let
me
say
tis
but
the
fate
of
place
and
the
rough
brake
that
virtue
must
go
through
we
must
not
stint
our
necessary
actions
in
the
fear
to
cope
malicious
censurers
which
ever
as
ravnous
fishes
do
a
vessel
follow
that
is
newtrimmd
but
benefit
no
further
than
vainly
longing
what
we
oft
do
best
by
sick
interpreters
once
weak
ones
is
not
ours
or
not
allowd
what
worst
as
oft
hitting
a
grosser
quality
is
cried
up
for
our
best
act
if
we
shall
stand
still
in
fear
our
motion
will
be
mockd
or
carpd
at
we
should
take
root
here
where
we
sit
or
sit
statestatues
only
things
done
well
and
with
a
care
exempt
themselves
from
fear
things
done
without
example
in
their
issue
are
to
be
feard
have
you
a
precedent
of
this
commission
i
believe
not
any
we
must
not
rend
our
subjects
from
our
laws
and
stick
them
in
our
will
sixth
part
of
each
a
trembling
contribution
why
we
take
from
every
tree
lop
bark
and
part
o
the
timber
and
though
we
leave
it
with
a
root
thus
hackd
the
air
will
drink
the
sap
to
every
county
where
this
is
questiond
send
our
letters
with
free
pardon
to
each
man
that
has
denied
the
force
of
this
commission
pray
look
to
t
i
put
it
to
your
care
a
word
with
you
let
there
be
letters
writ
to
every
shire
of
the
kings
grace
and
pardon
the
grievd
commons
hardly
conceive
of
me
let
it
be
noisd
that
through
our
intercession
this
revokement
and
pardon
comes
i
shall
anon
advise
you
further
in
the
proceeding
i
am
sorry
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
run
in
your
displeasure
it
grieves
many
the
gentleman
is
learnd
and
a
most
rare
speaker
to
nature
none
more
bound
his
training
such
that
he
may
furnish
and
instruct
great
teachers
and
never
seek
for
aid
out
of
himself
yet
see
when
these
so
noble
benefits
shall
prove
not
well
disposd
the
mind
growing
once
corrupt
they
turn
to
vicious
forms
ten
times
more
ugly
than
ever
they
were
fair
this
man
so
complete
who
was
enrolld
mongst
wonders
and
when
we
almost
with
ravishd
listening
could
not
find
his
hour
of
speech
a
minute
he
my
lady
hath
into
monstrous
habits
put
the
graces
that
once
were
his
and
is
become
as
black
as
if
besmeard
in
hell
sit
by
us
you
shall
hear
this
was
his
gentleman
in
trust
of
him
things
to
strike
honour
sad
bid
him
recount
the
forerecited
practices
whereof
we
cannot
feel
too
little
hear
too
much
stand
forth
and
with
bold
spirit
relate
what
you
most
like
a
careful
subject
have
collected
out
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
speak
freely
first
it
was
usual
with
him
every
day
it
would
infect
his
speech
that
if
the
king
should
without
issue
die
hed
carry
it
so
to
make
the
sceptre
his
these
very
words
ive
heard
him
utter
to
his
soninlaw
lord
abergavenny
to
whom
by
oath
he
menacd
revenge
upon
the
cardinal
please
your
highness
note
this
dangerous
conception
in
this
point
not
friended
by
his
wish
to
your
high
person
his
will
is
most
malignant
and
it
stretches
beyond
you
to
your
friends
my
learnd
lord
cardinal
deliver
all
with
charity
speak
on
how
grounded
he
his
title
to
the
crown
upon
our
fail
to
this
point
hast
thou
heard
him
at
any
time
speak
aught
he
was
brought
to
this
by
a
vain
prophecy
of
nicholas
hopkins
what
was
that
hopkins
sir
a
chartreux
friar
his
confessor
who
fed
him
every
minute
with
words
of
sovereignty
how
knowst
thou
this
not
long
before
your
highness
sped
to
france
the
duke
being
at
the
rose
within
the
parish
saint
lawrence
poultney
did
of
me
demand
what
was
the
speech
among
the
londoners
concerning
the
french
journey
i
replied
men
feard
the
french
would
prove
perfidious
to
the
kings
danger
presently
the
duke
said
twas
the
fear
indeed
and
that
he
doubted
twould
prove
the
verity
of
certain
words
spoke
by
a
holy
monk
that
oft
says
he
hath
sent
to
me
wishing
me
to
permit
john
de
la
car
my
chaplain
a
choice
hour
to
hear
from
him
a
matter
of
some
moment
whom
after
under
the
confessions
seal
he
solemnly
had
sworn
that
what
he
spoke
my
chaplain
to
no
creature
living
but
to
me
should
utter
with
demure
confidence
this
pausingly
ensud
neither
the
king
nor
s
heirs
tell
you
the
duke
shall
prosper
bid
him
strive
to
gain
the
love
o
the
commonalty
the
duke
shall
govern
england
if
i
know
you
well
you
were
the
dukes
surveyor
and
lost
your
office
on
the
complaint
o
the
tenants
take
good
heed
you
charge
not
in
your
spleen
a
noble
person
and
spoil
your
nobler
soul
i
say
take
heed
yes
heartily
beseech
you
let
him
on
go
forward
on
my
soul
ill
speak
but
truth
i
told
my
lord
the
duke
by
the
devils
illusions
the
monk
might
be
deceivd
and
that
twas
dangerous
for
him
to
ruminate
on
this
so
far
until
it
forgd
him
some
design
which
being
believd
it
was
much
like
to
do
he
answerd
tush
it
can
do
me
no
damage
adding
further
that
had
the
king
in
his
last
sickness
faild
the
cardinals
and
sir
thomas
lovells
heads
should
have
gone
off
ha
what
so
rank
ah
ha
theres
mischief
in
this
man
canst
thou
say
further
i
can
my
liege
proceed
being
at
greenwich
after
your
highness
had
reprovd
the
duke
about
sir
william
blomer
i
remember
of
such
a
time
being
my
sworn
servant
the
duke
retaind
him
his
but
on
what
hence
if
quoth
he
i
for
this
had
been
committed
as
to
the
tower
i
thought
i
would
have
playd
the
part
my
father
meant
to
act
upon
the
usurper
richard
who
being
at
salisbury
made
suit
to
come
in
s
presence
which
if
granted
as
he
made
semblance
of
his
duty
would
have
put
his
knife
into
him
a
giant
traitor
now
madam
may
his
highness
live
in
freedom
and
this
man
out
of
prison
god
mend
all
theres
something
more
would
out
of
thee
what
sayst
after
the
duke
his
father
with
the
knife
he
stretchd
him
and
with
one
hand
on
his
dagger
another
spread
ons
breast
mounting
his
eyes
he
did
discharge
a
horrible
oath
whose
tenour
was
were
he
evil
usd
he
would
outgo
his
father
by
as
much
as
a
performance
does
an
irresolute
purpose
theres
his
period
to
sheathe
his
knife
in
us
he
is
attachd
call
him
to
present
trial
if
he
may
find
mercy
in
the
law
tis
his
if
none
let
him
not
seekt
of
us
by
day
and
night
hes
traitor
to
the
height
ist
possible
the
spells
of
france
should
juggle
men
into
such
strange
mysteries
new
customs
though
they
be
never
so
ridiculous
nay
let
em
be
unmanly
yet
are
followd
as
far
as
i
see
all
the
good
our
english
have
got
by
the
late
voyage
is
but
merely
a
fit
or
two
o
the
face
but
they
are
shrewd
ones
for
when
they
hold
em
you
would
swear
directly
their
very
noses
had
been
counsellors
to
pepin
or
clotharius
they
keep
state
so
they
have
all
new
legs
and
lame
ones
one
would
take
it
that
never
saw
em
pace
before
the
spavin
or
springhalt
reignd
among
em
death
my
lord
their
clothes
are
after
such
a
pagan
cut
too
that
sure
theyve
worn
out
christendom
how
now
what
news
sir
thomas
lovell
faith
my
lord
i
hear
of
none
but
the
new
proclamation
thats
clappd
upon
the
courtgate
what
ist
for
the
reformation
of
our
travelld
gallants
that
fill
the
court
with
quarrels
talk
and
tailors
i
am
glad
tis
there
now
i
would
pray
our
monsieurs
to
think
an
english
courtier
may
be
wise
and
never
see
the
louvre
they
must
either
for
so
run
the
conditions
leave
those
remnants
of
fool
and
feather
that
they
got
in
france
with
all
their
honourable
points
of
ignorance
pertaining
thereunto
as
fights
and
fireworks
abusing
better
men
than
they
can
be
out
of
a
foreign
wisdom
renouncing
clean
the
faith
they
have
in
tennis
and
tall
stockings
short
blisterd
breeches
and
those
types
of
travel
and
understand
again
like
honest
men
or
pack
to
their
old
playfellows
there
i
take
it
they
may
cum
privilegio
wear
away
the
lag
end
of
their
lewdness
and
be
laughd
at
tis
time
to
give
em
physic

diseases

grown

a
loss

is
he
found
guilty
yes
truly
is
he
and
condemnd
upont
i
am
sorry
for
t
so
are
a
number
more
but
pray
how
passd
it
ill
tell
you
in
a
little
the
great
duke
came
to
the
bar
where
to
his
accusations
he
pleaded
still
not
guilty
and
allegd
many
sharp
reasons
to
defeat
the
law
the
kings
attorney
on
the
contrary
urgd
on
the
examinations
proofs
confessions
of
divers
witnesses
which
the
duke
desird
to
have
brought
viv
voce
to
his
face
at
which
appeard
against
him
his
surveyor
sir
gilbert
peck
his
chancellor
and
john
car
confessor
to
him
with
that
devilmonk
hopkins
that
made
this
mischief
that
was
he
that
fed
him
with
his
prophecies
the
same
all
these
accusd
him
strongly
which
he
fain
would
have
flung
from
him
but
indeed
he
could
not
and
so
his
peers
upon
this
evidence
have
found
him
guilty
of
high
treason
much
he
spoke
and
learnedly
for
life
but
all
was
either
pitied
in
him
or
forgotten
after
all
this
how
did
he
bear
himself
when
he
was
brought
again
to
the
bar
to
hear
his
knell
rung
out
his
judgment
he
was
stirrd
with
such
an
agony
he
sweat
extremely
and
something
spoke
in
choler
ill
and
hasty
but
he
fell
to
himself
again
and
sweetly
in
all
the
rest
showd
a
most
noble
patience
i
do
not
think
he
fears
death
sure
he
does
not
he
never
was
so
womanish
the
cause
he
may
a
little
grieve
at
certainly
the
cardinal
is
the
end
of
this
tis
likely
by
all
conjectures
first
kildares
attainder
then
deputy
of
ireland
who
removd
earl
surrey
was
sent
thither
and
in
haste
too
lest
he
should
help
his
father
that
trick
of
state
was
a
deep
envious
one
at
his
return
no
doubt
he
will
requite
it
this
is
noted
and
generally
whoever
the
king
favours
the
cardinal
instantly
will
find
employment
and
far
enough
from
court
too
all
the
commons
hate
him
perniciously
and
o
my
conscience
wish
him
ten
fathom
deep
this
duke
as
much
they
love
and
dote
on
call
him
bounteous
buckingham
the
mirror
of
all
courtesy
stay
there
sir
and
see
the
noble
ruind
man
you
speak
of
lets
stand
close
and
behold
him
all
good
people
you
that
thus
far
have
come
to
pity
me
hear
what
i
say
and
then
go
home
and
lose
me
i
have
this
day
receivd
a
traitors
judgment
and
by
that
name
must
die
yet
heaven
bear
witness
and
if
i
have
a
conscience
let
it
sink
me
even
as
the
axe
falls
if
i
be
not
faithful
the
law
i
bear
no
malice
for
my
death
t
has
done
upon
the
premises
but
justice
but
those
that
sought
it
i
could
wish
more
christians
be
what
they
will
i
heartily
forgive
em
yet
let
em
look
they
glory
not
in
mischief
nor
build
their
evils
on
the
graves
of
great
men
for
then
my
guiltless
blood
must
cry
against
em
for
further
life
in
this
world
i
neer
hope
nor
will
i
sue
although
the
king
have
mercies
more
than

dare
make
faults

few
that
lovd
me
and
dare
be
bold
to
weep
for

noble
friends
and
fellows
whom
to
leave
is
only
bitter
to
him
only
dying
go
with
me
like
good
angels
to
my
end
and

long
divorce

of
your
prayers
one
sweet
sacrifice
and
lift
my
soul
to
heaven
lead
on
o
gods
name
i
do
beseech
your
grace
for
charity
if
ever
any
malice
in
your
heart
were
hid
against

the
greatness
of
his
person

it
alone
my
state
now
will
but
mock
me
when
i
came
hither
i
was
lord
high
constable
and
duke
of
buckingham
now
poor
edward
bohun
yet
i
am
richer
than
my
base
accusers
that
never
knew
what
truth
meant
i
now
seal
it
and
with
that
blood
will
make
them
one
day
groan
fort
my
noble
father
henry
of
buckingham
who
first
raisd
head
against
usurping
richard
flying
for
succour
to
his
servant
banister
being
distressd
was
by
that
wretch
betrayd
and
without
trial
fell
gods
peace
be
with
him
henry
the
seventh
succeeding
truly
pitying
my
fathers
loss
like
a
most
royal
prince
restord
me
to
my
honours
and
out
of
ruins
made
my
name
once
more
noble
now
his
son
henry
the
eighth
life
honour
name
and
all
that
made
me
happy
at
one
stroke
has
taken
for
ever
from
the
world
i
had
my
trial
and
must
needs
say
a
noble
one
which
makes
me
a
little
happier
than
my
wretched
father
yet
thus
far
we
are
one
in
fortunes
both
fell
by
our
servants
by
those
men
welovd
most
a
most
unnatural
and
faithless
service
heaven
has
an
end
in
all
yet
you
that
hear
me
this
from
a
dying
man
receive
as
certain
where
you
are
liberal
of
your
loves
and
counsels
be
sure
you
be
not
loose
for
those
you
make
friends
and
give
your
hearts
to
when
they
once
perceive
the
least
rub
in
your
fortunes
fall
away
like
water
from
ye
never
found
again
but
where
they
mean
to
sink
ye
all
good
people
pray
for
me
i
must
now
forsake
ye
the
last
hour
of
my
long
weary
life
is
come
upon
me
farewell
and
when
you
would
say
something
that
is
sad
speak
how
i
fell
i
have
done
and
god
forgive
me
o
this
is
full
of
pity
sir
it
calls
i
fear
too
many
curses
on
their
heads
that
were
the
authors
if
the
duke
be
guiltless
tis
full
of
woe
yet
i
can
give
you
inkling
of
an
ensuing
evil
if
it
fall
greater
than
this
good
angels
keep
it
from
us
what
may
it
be
you
do
not
doubt
my
faith
sir
this
secret
is
so
weighty
twill
require
a
strong
faith
to
conceal
it
let
me
have
it
i
do
not
talk
much
i
am
confident
you
shall
sir
did
you
not
of
late
days
hear
a
buzzing
of
a
separation
between
the
king
and
katharine
yes
but
it
held
not
for
when
the
king
once
heard
it
out
of
anger
he
sent
command
to
the
lord
mayor
straight
to
stop
the
rumour
and
allay
those
tongues
that
durst
disperse
it
but
that
slander
sir
is
found
a
truth
now
for
it
grows
again
fresher
than
eer
it
was
and
held
for
certain
the
king
will
venture
at
it
either
the
cardinal
or
some
about
him
near
have
out
of
malice
to
the
good
queen
possessd
him
with
a
scruple
that
will
undo
her
to
confirm
this
too
cardinal
campeius
is
arrivd
and
lately
as
all
think
for
this
business
tis
the
cardinal
and
merely
to
revenge
him
on
the
emperor
for
not
bestowing
on
him
at
his
asking
the
archbishopric
of
toledo
this
is
purposd
i
think
you
have
hit
the
mark
but
ist
not
cruel
that
she
should
feel
the
smart
of
this
the
cardinal
will
have
his
will
and
she
must
fall
tis
woeful
we
are
too
open
here
to
argue
this
lets
think
in
private
more
my
lord
the
horses
your
lordship
sent
for
with
all
the
care
i
had
i
saw
well
chosen
ridden
and
furnished
they
were
young
and
handsome
and
of
the
best
breed
in
the
north
when
they
were
ready
to
set
out
for
london
a
man
of
my
lord
cardinals
by
commission
and
main
power
took
them
from
me
with
this
reason
his
master
would
be
served
before
a
subject
if
not
before
the
king
which
stopped
our
mouths
sir
i
fear
he
will
indeed
well
let
him
have
them
he
will
have
all
i
think
well
met
my
lord
chamberlain
good
day
to
both
your
graces
how
is
the
king
employd
i
left
him
private
full
of
sad
thoughts
and
troubles
whats
the
cause
it
seems
the
marriage
with
his
brothers
wife
has
crept
too
near
his
conscience
no
his
conscience
has
crept
too
near
another
lady
tis
so
this
is
the
cardinals
doing
the
kingcardinal
that
blind
priest
like
the
eldest
son
of
fortune
turns
what
he
list
the
king
will
know
him
one
day
pray
god
he
do
hell
never
know
himself
else
how
holily
he
works
in
all
his
business
and
with
what
zeal
for
now
he
has
crackd
the
league
between
us
and
the
emperor
the
queens
great
nephew
he
dives
into
the
kings
soul
and
there
scatters
dangers
doubts
wringing
of
the
conscience
fears
and
despairs
and
all
these
for
his
marriage
and
out
of
all
these
to
restore
the
king
he
counsels
a
divorce
a
loss
of
her
that
like
a
jewel
has
hung
twenty
years
about
his
neck
yet
never
lost
her
lustre
of
her
that
loves
him
with
that
excellence
that
angels
love
good
men
with
even
of
her
that
when
the
greatest
stroke
of
fortune
falls
will
bless
the
king
and
is
not
this
course
pious
heaven
keep
me
from
such
counsel
tis
most
true
these
news
are
every
where
every
tongue
speaks
em
and
every
true
heart
weeps
fort
all
that
dare
look
into
these
affairs
see
this
main
end
the
french
kings

will
one
day

the
kings
eyes
that
so
long
have
slept
upon
this
bold
bad
man
and
free
us
from
his
slavery
we
had
need
pray
and
heartily

that
he
ran
mad
and
died
heavens

living
murmurers

places
of
rebuke

was
a
fool
for
he

be
virtuous
that
good
fellow
if
i
command

my
appointment
i
will
have
none
so
near
else
learn
this
brother
we
live
not
to
be
gripd
by
meaner
persons
deliver
this
with
modesty
to
the
queen
the
most
convenient
place
that
i
can
think
of
for
such
receipt
of
learning
is
blackfriars
there
ye
shall
meet
about
this
weighty
business
my
wolsey
see
it
furnishd
o
my
lord
would
it
not
grieve
an
able
man
to
leave
so
sweet
a
bedfellow
but
conscience
conscience
o
tis
a
tender
place
and
i
must
leave
her
not
for
that
neither
heres
the
pang
that
pinches
his
highness
having
livd
so
long
with
her
and
she
so
good
a
lady
that
no
tongue
could
ever
pronounce
dishonour
of
her
by
my
life
she
never
knew
harmdoing
o
now
after
so
many
courses
of
the
sun
enthrond
still
growing
in
a
majesty
and
pomp
the
which
to
leave
a
thousandfold
more
bitter
than
tis
sweet
at
first
to
acquire
after
this
process
to
give
her
the
avaunt
it
is
a
pity
would
move
a
monster
hearts
of
most
hard
temper
melt
and
lament
for
her
o
gods
will
much
better
she
neer
had
known
pomp
though
t
be
temporal
yet
if
that
quarrel
fortune
do
divorce
it
from
the
bearer
tis
a
sufferance
panging
as
soul
and
bodys
severing
alas
poor
lady
shes
a
stranger
now
again
so
much
the
more
must
pity
drop
upon
her
verily
i
swear
tis
better
to
be
lowly
born
and
range
with
humble
livers
in
content
than
to
be
perkd
up
in
a
glistring
grief
and
wear
a
golden
sorrow
our
content
is
our
best
having
by
my
troth
and
maidenhead
i
would
not
be
a
queen
beshrew
me
i
would
and
venture
maidenhead
fort
and
so
would
you
for
all
this
spice
of
your
hypocrisy
you
that
have
so
fair
parts
of
woman
on
you
have
too
a
womans
heart
which
ever
yet
affected
eminence
wealth
sovereignty
which
to
say
sooth
are
blessings
and
which
gifts
saving
your
mincing
the
capacity
of
your
soft
cheveril
conscience
would
receive
if
you
might
please
to
stretch
it
nay
good
troth
yes
troth
and
troth
you
would
not
be
a
queen
no
not
for
all
the
riches
under
heaven

strange
a
threepence
bowd

hire
me

am
to

but
i
pray

what
think
you
of
a
duchess

you
limbs
to
bear
that
load
of

weakly
made
pluck
off
a
little
i
would
not
be
a
young
count
in
your
way
for
more
than
blushing
comes
to
if
your
back
cannot
vouchsafe
this
burden
tis
too
weak
ever
to
get
a
boy
how
you
do
talk
i
swear
again
i
would
not
be
a
queen
for
all
the
world
in
faith
for
little
england
youd
venture
an
emballing
i
myself
would
for
carnarvonshire
although
there
longd
no
more
to
the
crown
but
that
lo
who
comes
here

morrow
ladies
what
weret
worth
to
know
the
secret
of
your
conference

good
lord

your
demand

values
not
your
asking
our
mistress
sorrows
we
were
pitying
it
was
a
gentle
business
and
becoming
the
action
of
good
women
there

his
good
opinion
of
you

to
you
no
less
flowing
than
marchioness
of

of
his
grace
he
adds
i

nothing
nor
my
prayers

not
words
duly
hallowd
nor
my
wishes
more
worth
than
empty
vanities

can
return

to
speak
my
thanks
and
my
obedience

so
mingled

upward
of
twenty
years

the
king
your
father
was
reputed
for
a
prince
most
prudent
of
an
excellent
and
unmatchd
wit
and
judgment
ferdinand
my
father
king
of
spain
was
reckond
one
the
wisest
prince
that
there
had
reignd
by
many
a
year
before
it
is
not
to
be
questiond
that
they
had
gatherd
a
wise
council
to
them
of
every
realm
that
did
debate
this
business
who
deemd
our
marriage
lawful
wherefore
i
humbly
beseech
you

to
spare
me
till
i
may
be
by
my
friends
in
spain
advisd
whose
counsel
i
will
implore
if

i
the
name
of

reverend
fathers

of
singular
integrity
and
learning
yea
the
elect
o
the
land
who
are
assembled
to
plead
your
cause
it
shall
be
therefore
bootless
that
longer
you
desire
the
court
as
well
for
your
own
quiet
as
to
rectify
what
is
unsettled
in
the
king
his
grace
hath
spoken
well
and
justly
therefore
madam

arguments

now
producd
and
heard
lord
cardinal
to
you
i
speak
your
pleasure
madam
sir
i
am
about
to
weep
but
thinking
that
we
are
a
queen
or
long
have
dreamd
so
certain
the
daughter
of
a
king
my
drops
of
tears
ill
turn
to
sparks
of
fire
be
patient
yet
i
will
when
you
are
humble
nay
before
or
god
will
punish
me
i
do
believe
inducd
by
potent
circumstances
that
you
are
mine
enemy
and
make
my
challenge
you
shall
not
be
my
judge
for
it
is
you
have
blown
this
coal
betwixt
my
lord
and
me
which
gods
dew
quench
therefore
i
say
again
i
utterly
abhor
yea
from
my
soul
refuse
you
for
my
judge
whom
yet
once
more
i
hold
my
most
malicious
foe
and
think
not
at
all
a
friend
to
truth
i
do
profess
you
speak
not
like
yourself
who
ever
yet
have
stood
to
charity
and
displayd
the
effects
of
disposition
gentle
and
of
wisdom
oertopping
womans
power
madam
you
do
me
wrong
i
have
no
spleen
against
you
nor
injustice
for
you
or
any
how
far
i
have
proceeded
or
how
far
further
shall
is
warranted
by
a
commission
from
the
consistory
yea
the
whole
consistory
of
rome
you
charge
me
that
i
have
blown
this
coal
i
do
deny
it
the
king
is
present
if
it
be
known
to
him
that
i
gainsay
my
deed
how
may
he
wound
and
worthily
my
falsehood
yea
as
much
as
you
have
done
my
truth
if
he
know
that
i
am
free
of
your
report
he
knows
i
am
not
of
your
wrong
therefore
in
him
it
lies
to
cure
me
and
the
cure
is
to
remove
these
thoughts
from
you
the
which
before
his
highness
shall
speak
in
i
do
beseech
you
gracious
madam
to
unthink
your
speaking
and

appeal
unto
the

whole
cause

manner
i
require
your
highness
that
it
shall
please
you
to
declare
in
hearing
of
all
these
ears
for
where
i
am
robbd
and
bound
there
must
i
be
unloosd
although
not
there
at
once
and
fully
satisfied
whether
ever
i
did
broach
this
business
to
your
highness
or
laid
any
scruple
in
your
way
which
might
induce
you
to
the
question
ont
or
ever
have
to
you
but
with
thanks
to
god
for
such
a
royal
lady
spake
one
the
least
word
that
might
be
to
the
prejudice
of
her
present
state
or
touch
of
her
good
person
my
lord
cardinal
i
do
excuse
you
yea
upon
mine
honour
i
free
you
fromt
you
are
not
to
be
taught
that
you
have
many
enemies
that
know
not
why
they
are
so
but
like
to
village
curs
bark
when
their
fellows
do
by
some
of
these
the
queen
is
put
in
anger
youre
excusd
but
will
you
be
more
justified
you
ever
have
wishd
the
sleeping
of
this
business
never
desird
it
to
be
stirrd
but
oft
have
hinderd
oft
the
passages
made
toward
it
on
my
honour
i
speak
my
good
lord
cardinal
to
this
point
and
thus
far
clear
him
now
what
movd
me
tot
i
will
be
bold
with
time
and
your
attention
then
mark
the
inducement
thus
it
came
give
heed
tot
my
conscience
first
receivd
a
tenderness
scruple
and
prick
on
certain
speeches
utterd
by
the
bishop
of
bayonne
then
french
ambassador
who
had
been
hither
sent
on
the
debating
a
marriage
twixt
the
duke
of
orleans
and
our
daughter
mary
i
the
progress
of
this
business
ere
a
determinate
resolution
he
i
mean
the
bishop
did
require
a
respite
wherein
he
might
the
king
his
lord
advertise
whether
our
daughter
were
legitimate
respecting
this
our
marriage
with
the
dowager
sometimes
our
brothers
wife
this
respite
shook
the
bosom
of
my
conscience
enterd
me
yea
with
a
splitting
power
and
made
to
tremble
the
region
of
my
breast
which
forcd
such
way
that
many
mazd
considerings
did
throng
and
pressd
in
with
this
caution
first
methought
i
stood
not
in
the
smile
of
heaven
who
had
commanded
nature
that
my
ladys
womb
if
it
conceivd
a
male
child
by
me
should
do
no
more
offices
of
life
tot
than
the
grave
does
to
the
dead
for
her
male
issue
or
died
where
they
were
made
or
shortly
after
this
world
had
aird
them
hence
i
took
a
thought
this
was
a
judgment
on
me
that
my
kingdom
well
worthy
the
best
heir
o
the
world
should
not
be
gladded
int
by
me
then
follows
that
i
weighd
the
danger
which
my
realms
stood
in
by
this
my
issues
fail
and
that
gave
to
me
many
a
groaning
throe
thus
hulling
in
the
wild
sea
of
my
conscience
i
did
steer
toward
this
remedy
whereupon
we
are
now
present
here
together
thats
to
say
i
meant
to
rectify
my
conscience
which
i
then
did
feel
full
sick
and
yet
not
well
by
all
the
revrend
fathers
of
the
land
and
doctors
learnd
first
i
began
in
private
with
you
my
lord
of
lincoln
you
remember
how
under
my
oppression
i
did
reek
when
i
first
movd
you
very
well
my
liege
i
have
spoke
long
be
pleasd
yourself
to
say
how
far
you
satisfied
me
so
please
your
highness
the
question
did
at
first
so
stagger
me
bearing
a
state
of
mighty
moment
int
and
consequence
of
dread
that
i
committed
the
daringst
counsel
that
i
had
to
doubt
and
did
entreat
your
highness
to
this
course
which
you
are
running
here
then
i
movd
you
my
lord
of
canterbury
and
got
your
leave
to
make
this
present
summons
unsolicited
i
left
no
reverend
person
in
this
court
but
by
particular
consent
proceeded
under
your
hands
and
seals
therefore
go
on
for
no
dislike
i
the
world
against
the
person
of
the
good
queen
but
the
sharp
thorny
points
of
my
alleged
reasons
drive
this
forward
prove
but
our
marriage
lawful
by
my
life
and
kingly
dignity
we
are
contented
to
wear
our
mortal
state
to
come
with
her
katharine
our
queen
before
the
primest
creature
thats
paragond
o
the
world
so
please
your
highness
the
queen
being
absent
tis
a
needful
fitness
that
we
adjourn
this
court
till
further
day
mean
while
must
be
an
earnest
motion
made
to
the
queen
to
call
back
her
appeal
she
intends
unto
his
holiness
i
may
perceive
these
cardinals
trifle
with
me
i
abhor
this
dilatory
sloth
and
tricks
of
rome
my
learnd
and
wellbeloved
servant
cranmer
prithee
return
with
thy
approach
i
know
my
comfort
comes
along
break
up
the
court
i
say
set
on
take
thy
lute
wench
my
soul
grows
sad
with
troubles
sing
and
disperse
em
if
thou
canst
leave
working
orpheus
with
his
lute
made
trees
and
the
mountain
tops
that
freeze
bow
themselves
when
he
did
sing
to
his
music
plants
and
flowers
ever
sprung
as
sun
and
showers
there
had
made
a
lasting
spring
every
thing
that
heard
him
play
even
the
billows
of
the
sea
hung
their
heads
and
then
lay
by
in
sweet
music
is
such
art
killing
care
and
grief
of
heart
fall
asleep
or
hearing
die
how
now
ant
please
your
grace
the
two
great
cardinals

the
presence

truant
since
my
coming

more
strange
suspicious

their
poor
mistress

deep
suspicion
where

that
honour
every
good
tongue
blesses
nor
to
betray
you
any
way
to
sorrow
you
have
too
much
good
lady
but
to
know
how
you
stand
minded
in
the
weighty
difference
between
the
king
and
you
and
to
deliver
like
free
and
honest
men
our
just
opinions
and
comforts
to
your
cause
most
honourd
madam
my
lord
of
york
out
of
his
noble
nature
zeal
and
obedience
he
still
bore
your
grace
forgetting
like
a
good
man
your
late
censure
both
of
his
truth
and
him
which
was
too
far
offers
as
i
do
in
sign
of
peace
his
service
and
his
counsel
to
betray
me
my
lords
i
thank
you
both
for
your
good
wills
ye

like
honest
men
pray
god

to
make
ye
suddenly
an
answer
in
such
a
point
of
weight
so
near
mine
honour
more
near
my
life
i
fear
with
my
weak
wit
and
to
such
men
of
gravity
and
learning
in
truth
i
know
not
i
was
set
at
work
among
my
maids
full
little
god

looking
either
for
such
men
or
such
business
for
her
sake
that

been
for
i

the
last
fit
of
my
greatness

these
fears
your
hopes
and
friends
are
infinite
in
england

that
any
englishman
dare
give
me
counsel
or
be
a
known
friend
gainst
his
highness
pleasure
though
he
be
grown
so
desperate
to

a
subject

weigh
out
my
afflictions
they
that
my

this
your
christian
counsel

upon
ye

there
sits
a
judge
that
no
king
can
corrupt
your
rage
mistakes
us
the
more
shame
for
ye
holy
men
i
thought
ye
upon
my
soul
two
reverend
cardinal
virtues
but
cardinal
sins
and
hollow
hearts
i
fear

em
for
shame

not
wish

half
my
miseries

have
more
charity

heavens
sake
take
heed
lest
at
once
the
burden
of
my
sorrows
fall
upon

is
a
mere
distraction

turn
the
good
we

into
nothing
woe
upon
ye
and
all
such
false
professors
would
ye
have
me
if
ye
have
any
justice
any
pity
if
ye
be
anything
but
churchmens
habits
put
my
sick
cause
into
his
hands
that
hates
me
alas
he
has
banishd
me
his
bed
already
his
love
too
long
ago
i
am
old
my
lords
and
all
the
fellowship
i
hold
now
with

only
my
obedience

this
wretchedness
all
your
studies
make
me
a
curse
like
this
your
fears

worse

woman

dare
say
without
vainglory
never
yet
branded
with
suspicion

my
full
affections
still
met
the
king
lovd
him

my
prayers
to
content
him
and

i
thus
rewarded

me
a
constant
woman
to
her
husband
one
that
neer
dreamd
a
joy
beyond
his
pleasure

that
woman

she
has
done
most
yet

i
add
an
honour
a
great
patience
madam
you
wander
from
the
good
we
aim
at
my
lord

not
make
myself
so
guilty
to
give
up
willingly
that
noble
title
your
master

me
to
nothing
but
death
shall
eer
divorce
my
dignities
pray

but
heaven
knows
your
hearts
what
will
become
of
me
now
wretched
lady
i
am
the
most
unhappy
woman
living
alas
poor
wenches

kingdom
where
no
pity
no
friends
no
hope
no
kindred

me
almost
no
grave
allowd
me
like
the
lily
that
once
was
mistress
of
the
field
and
flourishd
ill
hang
my
head
and
perish
if
your
grace
could
but
be
brought

know
our
ends
are
honest
youd
feel
more
comfort
why
should
we
good
lady
upon
what
cause
wrong
you
alas
our
places
the
way
of
our
profession
is
against

we
are
to
cure
such
sorrows
not
to
sow
them
for
goodness
sake
consider
what
you
do
how
you
may
hurt
yourself
ay
utterly
grow
from
the
kings
acquaintance
by
this
carriage
the
hearts
of
princes
kiss
obedience
so
much
they
love
it
but
to
stubborn
spirits
they
swell
and
grow
as
terrible
as
storms
i
know
you
have
a
gentle
noble
temper
a
soul
as
even
as
a
calm
pray

peacemakers
friends
and
servants

find
it
so

your
virtues

these
weak
womens
fears

casts
such
doubts
as
false
coin

a
woman

seemly
answer
to
such
persons
pray
do
my
service
to
his
majesty

my
prayers
while
i
shall
have
my
life
come
reverend
fathers
bestow
your
counsels
on
me
she
now
begs
that
little
thought
when
she
set
footing
here
she
should
have
bought
her
dignities
so
dear
if
you
will
now
unite
in
your
complaints
and
force
them
with
a
constancy
the
cardinal
cannot
stand
under
them
if
you
omit
the
offer
of
this
time
i
cannot
promise
but
that
you
shall
sustain
moe
new
disgraces
with
these
you
bear
already
i
am
joyful
to
meet
the
least
occasion
that
may
give
me
remembrance
of
my
fatherinlaw
the
duke
to
be
revengd
on
him
which
of
the
peers
have
uncontemnd
gone
by
him
or
at
least
strangely
neglected
when
did
he
regard
the
stamp
of
nobleness
in
any
person
out
of
himself
my
lords
you
speak
your
pleasures
what
he
deserves
of
you
and
me
i
know
what
we
can
do
to
him
though
now
the
time
gives
way
to
us
i
much
fear
if
you
cannot
bar
his
access
to
the
king
never
attempt
any
thing
on
him
for
he
hath
a
witchcraft
over
the
king
ins
tongue
o
fear
him
not
his
spell
in
that
is
out
the
king
hath
found
matter
against
him
that
for
ever
mars
the
honey
of
his
language
no
hes
settled
not
to
come
off
in
his
displeasure
sir
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
such
news
as
this
once
every
hour
believe
it
this
is
true
in
the
divorce
his
contrary
proceedings
are
all
unfolded
wherein
he
appears
as
i
would
wish
mine
enemy
how
came
his
practices
to
light
most
strangely
o
how
how
the
cardinals
letter
to
the
pope
miscarried
and
came
to
the
eye
o
the
king
wherein
was
read
that
the
cardinal
did
entreat
his
holiness
to
stay
the
judgment
o
the
divorce
for
if
it
did
take
place
i
do
quoth
he
perceive
my
king
is
tangled
in
affection
to
a
creature
of
the
queens
lady
anne
bullen
has
the
king
this
believe
it
will
this
work
the
king
in
this
perceives
him
how
he
coasts
and
hedges
his
own
way
but
in
this
point
all
his
tricks
founder
and
he
brings
his
physic
after
his
patients
death
the
king
already
hath
married
the
fair
lady
would
he
had
may
you
be
happy
in
your
wish
my
lord
for
i
profess
you
have
it
now
all
my
joy
trace
the
conjunction
my
amen
tot
all
mens
theres
order
given
for
her
coronation
marry
this
is
yet
but
young
and
may
be
left
to
some
ears
unrecounted
but
my
lords
she
is
a
gallant
creature
and
complete
in
mind
and
feature
i
persuade
me
from
her
will
fall
some
blessing
to
this
land
which
shall
in
it
be
memorizd
but
will
the
king
digest
this
letter
of
the
cardinals
the
lord
forbid
marry
amen
no
no
there
be
moe
wasps
that
buzz
about
his
nose

make
this
sting
the
sooner

campeius

stoln
away
to
rome

and
starts
stops
on
a
sudden
looks
upon
the
ground
then
lays
his
finger
on
his
temple
straight
springs
out
into
fast
gait
then
stops
again
strikes
his
breast
hard
and
anon
he
casts
his
eye
against
the
moon
in
most
strange
postures
we
have
seen
him
set
himself
it
may
well
be
there
is
a
mutiny
in
s
mind
this
morning
papers
of
state
he
sent
me
to
peruse
as
i
requird
and
wot
you
what
i
found
there
on
my
conscience
put
unwittingly
forsooth
an
inventory
thus
importing
the
several
parcels
of
his
plate
his
treasure
rich
stuffs
and
ornaments
of
household
which
i
find
at
such
a
proud
rate
that
it
outspeaks
possession
of
a
subject
its
heavens
will
some
spirit
put
this
paper
in
the
packet
to
bless
your
eye
withal
if
we
did
think
his
contemplation
were
above
the
earth
and
fixd
on
spiritual
object
he
should
still
dwell
in
his
musings
but
i
am
afraid
his
thinkings
are
below
the
moon
not
worth
his
serious
considering
heaven
forgive
me
ever
god
bless
your
highness
good
my
lord
you
are
full
of
heavenly
stuff
and
bear
the
inventory
of
your
best
graces
in
your
mind
the
which
you
were
now
running
oer
you
have
scarce
time
to
steal
from
spiritual
leisure
a
brief
span
to
keep
your
earthly
audit
sure
in
that
i
deem
you
an
ill
husband
and
am
glad
to
have
you
therein
my
companion
sir
for
holy
offices
i
have
a
time
a
time
to
think
upon
the
part
of
business
which
i
bear
i
the
state
and
nature
does
require
her
times
of
preservation
which
perforce
i
her
frail
son
amongst
my
brethren
mortal
must
give
my
tendance
to
you
have
said
well
and
ever
may
your
highness
yoke
together
as
i
will
lend
you
cause
my
doing
well
with
my
well
saying
tis
well
said
again
and
tis
a
kind
of
good
deed
to
say
well
and
yet
words
are
no
deeds
my
father
lovd
you
he
said
he
did
and
with
his
deed
did
crown
his
word
upon
you
since
i
had
my
office
i
have
kept
you
next
my
heart
have
not
alone
employd
you
where
high
profits
might
come
home
but
pard
my
present
havings
to
bestow
my
bounties
upon
you
what
should
this
mean
the
lord
increase
this
business
have
i
not
made
you
the
prime
man
of
the
state
i
pray
you
tell
me
if
what
i
now
pronounce
you
have
found
true
and
if
you
may
confess
it
say
withal
if
you
are
bound
to
us
or
no
what
say
you
my
sovereign
i
confess
your
royal
graces
showerd
on
me
daily
have
been
more
than
could
my
studied
purposes
requite
which
went
beyond
all
mans
endeavours
my
endeavours
have
ever
come
too
short
of
my
desires
yet
fild
with
my
abilities
mine
own
ends
have
been
mine
so
that
evermore
they
pointed
to
the
good
of
your
most
sacred
person
and
the
profit
of
the
state
for
your
great
graces
heapd
upon
me
poor
undeserver
i
can
nothing
render
but
allegiant
thanks
my
prayers
to
heaven
for
you
my
loyalty
which
ever
has
and
ever
shall
be
growing
till
death
that
winter
kill
it
fairly
answerd
a
loyal
and
obedient
subject
is
therein
illustrated
the
honour
of
it
does
pay
the
act
of
it
as
i
the
contrary
the
foulness
is
the
punishment
i
presume
that
as
my
hand
has
opend
bounty
to
you
my
heart
droppd
love
my
power
raind
honour
more
on
you
than
any
so
your

your
brain
and
every
function
of
your
power
should
notwithstanding
that
your
bond
of
duty
as
twere
in
loves
particular
be
more
to
me
your
friend
than
any
i
do
profess
that
for
your
highness
good
i
ever
labourd
more
than
mine
own
that

have
and
will
be
though
all
the
world
should
crack
their
duty
to
you
and
throw
it
from
their
soul
though
perils
did
abound
as
thick
as
thought
could
make
em
and
appear
in
forms
more
horrid
yet
my
duty
as

the
chafed
lion
upon
the
daring
huntsman
that

ireland
far
from

succour
from
the
king
from
all
that
might
have
mercy
on
the
fault
thou
gavst
him
whilst
your
great
goodness
out
of
holy
pity
absolvd
him
with
an
axe
this
and
all
else
this
talking
lord
can
lay
upon
my
credit
i
answer
is
most
false
the
duke
by
law
found
his
deserts
how
innocent
i
was
from
any
private
malice
in
his
end
his
noble
jury
and
foul
cause
can
witness
if
i
lovd
many
words
lord
i
should
tell
you
you
have
as
little
honesty
as
honour
that
in
the
way
of
loyalty
and
truth
toward
the
king
my
ever
royal
master
dare
mate
a

your
long
coat

protects
you
thou
shouldst

i
the

of
thee
else
my
lords
can
ye
endure
to
hear
this
arrogance
and
from
this
fellow
if
we
live
thus
tamely
to
be
thus
jaded
by
a
piece
of
scarlet
farewell
nobility
let
his
grace
go
forward
and
dare
us
with
his
cap
like
larks
all
goodness
is
poison
to
thy
stomach
yes
that
goodness
of
gleaning
all
the
lands
wealth
into
one
into
your
own
hands
cardinal
by
extortion
the
goodness
of
your
intercepted
packets
you
writ
to
the
pope
against
the
king
your
goodness
since
you
provoke
me
shall
be
most
notorious
my
lord
of
norfolk
as
you
are
truly
noble
as
you
respect
the
common
good
the
state
of
our
despisd
nobility
our
issues
who
if
he
live
will
scarce
be
gentlemen
produce
the
grand
sum
of
his
sins
the
articles
collected
from
his
life
ill
startle
you
worse
than
the
sacring
bell
when
the
brown
wench
lay
kissing
in
your
arms
lord
cardinal
how
much
methinks
i
could
despise
this
man
but
that
i
am
bound
in
charity
against
it
those
articles
my
lord
are
in
the
kings
hand
but
thus
much
they
are
foul
ones
so
much
fairer
and
spotless
shall
mine
innocence
arise
when
the
king
knows
my
truth
this
cannot
save
you
i
thank
my
memory
i
yet
remember
some
of
these
articles
and
out
they
shall
now
if
you
can
blush
and
cry
guilty
cardinal
youll
show
a
little
honesty
speak
on
sir
i
dare
your
worst
objections
if
i
blush
it
is
to
see
a
nobleman
want
manners
i
had
rather
want
those
than
my
head
have
at
you
first
that
without
the
kings
assent
or
know
ledge
you
wrought
to
be
a
legate
by
which
power
you
maimd
the
jurisdiction
of
all
bishops
then
that
in
all
you
writ
to
rome
or
else
to
foreign
princes
ego
et
rex
meus
was
still
inscribd
in
which
you
brought
the
king
to
be
your
servant
then
that
without
the
knowledge
either
of
king
or
council
when
you
went
ambassador
to
the
emperor
you
made
bold
to
carry
into
flanders
the
great
seal
item
you
sent
a
large
commission
to
gregory
de
cassado
to
conclude
without
the
kings
will
or
the
states
allowance
a
league
between
his
highness
and
ferrara
that
out
of
mere
ambition
you
have
causd
your
holy
hat
to
be
stampd
on
the
kings
coin
then
that
you
have
sent
innumerable
substance
by
what
means
got
i
leave
to
your
own
conscience
to
furnish
rome
and
to
prepare
the
ways
you
have
for
dignities
to
the
mere
undoing
of
all
the
kingdom
many
more
there
are
which
since
they
are
of
you
and
odious
i
will
not
taint
my
mouth
with
o
my
lord
press
not
a
falling
man
too
far
tis
virtue
his
faults
lie
open
to
the
laws
let
them
not
you
correct
him
my
heart
weeps
to
see
him
so
little
of
his
great
self
i
forgive
him
lord
cardinal
the
kings
further
pleasure
is
because
all
those
things
you
have
done
of
late
by
your
power
legatine
within
this
kingdom
fall
into
the
compass
of
a
pr
munire
that
therefore
such
a
writ
be
sud
against
you
to
forfeit
all
your
goods
lands
tenements
chattels
and
whatsoever
and
to
be
out
of
the
kings
protection
this
is
my
charge
and
so
well
leave
you
to
your
meditations
how
to
live
better
for
your
stubborn
answer
about
the
giving
back
the
great
seal
to
us
the
king
shall
know
it
and
no
doubt
shall
thank
you
so
fare
you
well
my
little
good
lord
cardinal
so
farewell
to
the
little
good
you
bear
me
farewell
a
long
farewell
to
all
my
greatness
this
is
the
state
of
man
today
be
puts
forth
the
tender
leaves
of
hopes
tomorrow
blossoms
and
bears
his
blushing
honours
thick
upon
him
the
third
day
comes
a
frost
a
killing
frost
and
when
he
thinks
good
easy
man
full
surely
his
greatness
is
aripening
nips
his
root
and
then
he
falls
as
i
do
i
have
venturd
like
little
wanton
boys
that
swim
on
bladders
this
many
summers
in
a
sea
of
glory
but
far
beyond
my
depth
my
highblown
pride
at
length
broke
under
me
and
now
has
left
me
weary
and
old
with
service
to
the
mercy
of
a
rude
stream
that
must
for
ever
hide
me
vain
pomp
and
glory
of
this
world
i
hate
yo
i
feel
my
heart
new
opend
o
how
wretched
is
that
poor
man
that
hangs
on
princes
favours
there
is
betwixt
that
smile
we
would
aspire
to
that
sweet
aspect
of
princes
and
their
ruin
more
pangs
and
fears
than
wars
or
women
have
and
when
he
falls
he
falls
like
lucifer
never
to
hope
again
why
how
now
cromwell
i
have
no
power
to
speak
sir
what
amazd
at
my
misfortunes
can
thy
spirit
wonder
a
great
man
should
decline
nay
an
you
weep
i
am
falln
indeed
how
does
your
grace
why
well
never
so
truly
happy
my
good
cromwell
i
know
myself
now
and
i
feel
within
me
a
peace
above
all
earthly
dignities
a
still
and
quiet
conscience
the
king
has
curd
me
i
humbly
thank
his
grace
and
from
these
shoulders
these
ruind
pillars
out
of
pity
taken
a
load
would
sink
a
navy
too
much
honour
o
tis
a
burden
cromwell
tis
a
burden
too
heavy
for
a
man
that
hopes
for
heaven
i
am
glad
your
grace
has
made
that
right
use
of
it
i
hope
i
have
i
am
able
now
methinks
out
of
a
fortitude
of
soul
i
feel
to
endure
more
miseries
and
greater
far
than
my
weakhearted
enemies
dare
offer
what
news
abroad
the
heaviest
and
the
worst
is
your
displeasure
with
the
king
god
bless
him
the
next
is
that
sir
thomas
more
is
chosen
lord
chancellor
in
your
place
thats
somewhat
sudden
but
hes
a
learned
man
may
he
continue
long
in
his
highness
favour
and
do
justice
for
truths
sake
and
his
conscience
that
his
bones
when
he
has
run
his
course
and
sleeps
in
blessings
may
have
a
tomb
of
orphans
tears
wept
on
em
what
more
that
cranmer
is
returnd
with
welcome
installd
lord
archbishop
of
canterbury
thats
news
indeed
last
that
the
lady
anne
whom
the
king
hath
in
secrecy
long
married
this
day
was
viewd
in
open
as
his
queen
going
to
chapel
and
the
voice
is
now
only
about
her
coronation
there
was
the
weight
that
pulld
me
down
o
cromwell
the
king
has
gone
beyond
me
all
my
glories
in
that
one
woman
i
have
lost
for
ever
no
sun
shall
ever
usher
forth
mine
honours
or
gild
again
the
noble
troops
that
waited
upon
my
smiles
go
get
thee
from
me
cromwell
i
am
a
poor
falln
man
unworthy
now
to
be
thy
lord
and
master
seek
the
king
that
sun
i
pray
may
never
set
i
have
told
him
what
and
how
true
thou
art
he
will
advance
thee
some
little
memory
of
me
will
stir
him
i
know
his
noble
nature
not
to
let
thy
hopeful
service
perish
too
good
cromwell
neglect
him
not
make
use
now
and
provide
for
thine
own
future
safety
o
my
lord

i
then
leave
you

i
needs
forego
so
good
so
noble
and
so
true

that

not
hearts
of
iron
with
what
a
sorrow
cromwell
leaves
his
lord

king

have
my
service

my
prayers
for
ever
and
for
ever
shall
be
yours
cromwell
i
did
not
think
to
shed
a
tear
in
all
my
miseries
but

hast
forcd
me
out
of
thy
honest
truth
to
play
the
woman

dry
our
eyes
and
thus
far

me
cromwell
and
when
i
am
forgotten
as
i
shall
be
and
sleep
in
dull
cold
marble
where
no
mention
of
me
more
must
be
heard
of
say
i
taught
thee
say
wolsey
that
once
trod
the
ways
of

but
i
beseech
you
whats
become
of
katharine
the
princess
dowager
how
goes
her
business
that
i
can
tell
you
too
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
accompanied
with
other
learned
and
reverend
fathers
of
his
order
held
a
late
court
at
dunstable
six
miles
off
from
ampthill
where
the
princess
lay
to
which
she
was
often
cited
by
them
but
appeard
not
and
to
be
short
for
not
appearance
and
the
kings
late
scruple
by
the
main
assent
of
all
these
learned
men
she
was
divorcd
and
the
late
marriage
made
of
none
effect
since
which
she
was
removd
to
kimbolton
where
she
remains
now
sick
alas
good
lady
the
trumpets

stand
close
the
queen

flourish

certain
ladies
or
countesses
with
plain
circlets
of
gold
without
flowers
they
pass
over
the
stage
in
order
and
state
a
royal
train
believe
me
these
i
know
whos
that
that
bears
the
sceptre
marquess
dorset
and
that
the
earl
of
surrey
with
the
rod
a
bold
brave
gentleman
that
should
be
the
duke
of
suffolk
tis
the
same
highsteward
and
that
my
lord
of
norfolk
yes
heaven
bless
thee
thou
hast
the
sweetest
face
i
ever
lookd
on
sir
as
i
have
a
soul
she
is
an
angel
our
king
has
all
the
indies
in
his
arms
and
more
and
richer
when
he
strains
that
lady
i
cannot
blame
his
conscience
they
that
bear
the
cloth
of
honour
over
her
are
four
barons
of
the
cinqueports
those
men
are
happy
and
so
are
all
are
near
her
i
take
it
she
that
carries
up
the
train
is
that
old
noble
lady
duchess
of
norfolk
it
is
and
all
the
rest
are
countesses
their
coronets
say
so
these
are
stars
indeed
and
sometimes
falling
ones
no
more
of
that
god
save
you
sir
where
have
you
been
broiling
among
the
crowd
i
the
abbey
where
a
finger
could
not
be
wedgd
in
more
i
am
stifled
with
the
mere
rankness
of
their
joy
you
saw
the
ceremony
that
i
did
how
was
it
well
worth
the
seeing
good
sir
speak
it
to
us
as
well
as
i
am
able
the
rich
stream
of
lords
and
ladies
having
brought
the
queen
to
a
prepard
place
in
the
choir
fell
off
a
distance
from
her
while
her
grace
sat
down
to
rest
awhile
some
half
an
hour
or
so
in
a
rich
chair
of
state
opposing
freely
the
beauty
of
her
person
to
the
people
believe
me
sir
she
is
the
goodliest
woman
that
ever
lay
by
man
which
when
the
people
had
the
full
view
of
such
a
noise
arose
as
the
shrouds
make
at
sea
in
a
stiff
tempest
as
loud
and
to
as
many
tunes
hats
cloaks
doublets
i
think
flew
up
and
had
their
faces
been
loose
this
day
they
had
been
lost
such
joy
i
never
saw
before
greatbellied
women
that
had
not
half
a
week
to
go
like
rams
in
the
old
time
of
war
would
shake
the
press
and
make
em
reel
before
them
no
man
living
could
say
this
is
my
wife
there
all
were
woven
so
strangely
in
one
piece
but
what
followd
at
length
her
grace
rose
and
with
modest
paces
came
to
the
altar
where
she
kneeld
and
saintlike
cast
her
fair
eyes
to
heaven
and
prayd
devoutly
then
rose
again
and
bowd
her
to
the
people
when
by
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
she
had
all
the
royal
makings
of
a
queen
as
holy
oil
edward
confessors
crown
the
rod
and
bird
of
peace
and
all
such
emblems
laid
nobly
on
her
which
performd
the
choir
with
all
the
choicest
music
of
the
kingdom
together
sung
te
deum
so
she
parted
and
with
the
same
full
state
pacd
back
again
to
yorkplace
where
the
feast
is
held
sir
you
must
no
more
call
it
yorkplace
thats
past
for
since
the
cardinal
fell
that
titles
lost
tis
now
the
kings
and
calld
whitehall
i
know
it
but
tis
so
lately
alterd
that
the
old
name
is
fresh
about
me
what
two
reverend
bishops
were
those
that
went
on
each
side
of
the
queen
stokesly
and
gardiner
the
one
of
winchester
newly
preferrd
from
the
kings
secretary
the
other
london
he
of
winchester
is
held
no
great
good
lover
of
the
archbishops
the
virtuous
cranmer
all
the
land
knows
that
however
yet
theres
no
great
breach
when
it
comes
cranmer
will
find
a
friend
will
not
shrink
from
him
who
may
that
be
i
pray
you
thomas
cromwell
a
man
in
much
esteem
with
the
king
and
truly
a
worthy
friend
the
king
has
made
him
master
o
the
jewel
house
and
one
already
of
the
privycouncil
he
will
deserve
more
yes
without
all
doubt
come
gentlemen
ye
shall
go
my
way
which
is
to
the
court
and
there
ye
shall
be
my
guests
something
i
can
command
as
i
walk
thither
ill
tell
ye
more
you
may
command
us
sir
how
does
your
grace
o
griffith
sick
to
death
my
legs
like
loaden
branches
bow
to
the
earth
willing
to
leave
their
burden
reach
a
chair
so
now
methinks
i
feel
a
little
ease
didst
thou
not
tell
me
griffith
as
thou
leddst
me
that
the
great
child
of
honour
cardinal
wolsey
was
dead
yes
madam
but
i
think
your
grace
out
of
the
pain
you
sufferd
gave
no
ear
tot
prithee
good
griffith
tell
me
how
he
died
if
well
he
steppd
before
me
happily
for
my
example
well
the
voice
goes
madam
for
after
the
stout
earl
northumberland
arrested
him
at
york
and
brought
him
forward
as
a
man
sorely
tainted
to
his
answer
he
fell
sick
suddenly
and
grew
so
ill
he
could
not
sit
his
mule
alas
poor
man
at
last
with
easy
roads
he
came
to
leicester
lodgd
in
the
abbey
where
the
reverend
abbot
with
all
his
covent
honourably
receivd
him
to
whom
he
gave
these
words
o
father
abbot
an
old
man
broken
with
the
storms
of
state
is
come
to
lay
his
weary
bones
among
ye
give
him
a
little
earth
for
charity
so
went
to
bed
where
eagerly
his
sickness
pursud
him
still
and
three
nights
after
this
about
the
hour
of
eight
which
he
himself
foretold
should
be
his
last
full
of
repentance
continual
meditations
tears
and
sorrows
he
gave
his
honours
to
the
world
again
his
blessed
part
to
heaven
and
slept
in
peace
so
may
he
rest
his
faults
lie
gently
on
him
yet
thus
far
griffith
give
me
leave
to
speak
him
and
yet
with
charity
he
was
a
man
of
an
unbounded
stomach
ever
ranking
himself
with
princes
one
that
by
suggestion
tied
all
the
kingdom
simony
was
fairplay
his
own
opinion
was
his
law
i
the
presence
he
would
say
untruths
and
be
ever
double
both
in
his
words
and
meaning
he
was
never
but
where
he
meant
to
ruin
pitiful
his
promises
were
as
he
then
was
mighty
but
his
performance
as
he
is
now
nothing
of
his
own
body
he
was
ill
and
gave
the
clergy
ill
example
noble
madam
mens
evil
manners
live
in
brass
their
virtues
we
write
in
water
may
it
please
your
highness
to
hear
me
speak
his
good
now
yes
good
griffith
i
were
malicious
else
this
cardinal
though
from
a
humble
stock
undoubtedly
was
fashiond
to
much
honour
from
his
cradle
he
was
a
scholar
and
a
ripe
and
good
one
exceeding
wise
fairspoken
and
persuading
lofty
and
sour
to
them
that
lovd
him
not
but
to
those
men
that
sought
him
sweet
as
summer
and
though
he
were
unsatisfied
in
getting
which
was
a
sin
yet
in
bestowing
madam
he
was
most
princely
ever
witness
for
him
those
twins
of
learning
that
he
raisd
in
you
ipswich
and
oxford
one
of
which
fell
with
him
unwilling
to
outlive
the
good
that
did
it
the
other
though
unfinishd
yet
so
famous
so
excellent
in
art
and
still
so
rising
that
christendom
shall
ever
speak
his
virtue
his
overthrow
heapd
happiness
upon
him
for
then
and
not
till
then
he
felt
himself
and
found
the
blessedness
of
being
little
and
to
add
greater
honours
to
his
age
than
man
could
give
him
he
died
fearing
god
after
my
death
i
wish
no
other
herald
no
other
speaker
of
my
living
actions
to
keep
mine
honour
from
corruption
but
such
an
honest
chronicler
as
griffith
whom
i
most
hated
living
thou
hast
made
me
with
thy
religious
truth
and
modesty
now
in
his
ashes
honour
peace
be
with
him
patience
be
near
me
still
and
set
me
lower
i
have
not
long
to
trouble
thee
good
griffith
cause
the
musicians

me
that
sad
note

knell

meditating
on
that
celestial
harmony

to
a
banquet
whose
bright
faces
cast
thousand
beams
upon
me
like
the
sun
they
promisd
me
eternal
happiness
and
brought
me
garlands
griffith
which
i
feel
i
am
not
worthy
yet
to
wear
i
shall
assuredly
i
am
most
joyful
madam

harsh
and
heavy
to
me

her
grace

alterd
on
the
sudden
how
long
her
face
is
drawn

looks
and
of
an
earthy
cold
mark
her
eyes

is
going

yet
i
had
thought
they
had
parted
so
much
honesty
among

good
manners
as
not
thus
to
suffer
a
man
of
his
place
and
so
near
our
favour
to
dance

on
their
lordships

master

why

we

in
council
please
your
honours
the
chief
cause
concerns
his
grace
of
canterbury
has
he
had
knowledge
of
it
yes
who
waits
there
without
my
noble
lords
yes
my
lord
archbishop
and
has
done
halfanhour
to
know
your
pleasures
let
him
come
in
your
grace
may
enter
now
my
good
lord
archbishop
im
very
sorry
to
sit
here
at
this
present
and
behold
that
chair
stand
empty
but
we
all
are
men
in
our
own
natures
frail
and
capable
of
our
flesh
few
are
angels
out
of
which
frailty
and
want
of
wisdom
you
that
best
should
teach
us
have
misdemeand
yourself
and
not
a
little
toward
the
king
first
then
his
laws
in
filling
the
whole
realm
by
your
teaching
and
your
chaplains
for
so
we
are
informd
with
new
opinions
divers
and
dangerous
which
are
heresies
and
not
reformd
may
prove
pernicious
which
reformation
must
be
sudden
too
my
noble
lords
for
those
that
tame
wild
horses
pace
em
not
in
their
hands
to
make
em
gentle
but
stop
their
mouths
with
stubborn
bits
and
spur
em
till
they
obey
the
manage
if
we
suffer
out
of
our
easiness
and
childish
pity
to
one
mans
honour
this
contagious
sickness
farewell
all
physic
and
what
follows
then
commotions
uproars
with
a
general
taint
of
the
whole
state
as
of
late
days
our
neighbours
the
upper
germany
can
dearly
witness
yet
freshly
pitied
in
our
memories
my
good
lords
hitherto
in
all
the
progress
both
of
my
life
and
office
i
have
labourd
and
with
no
little
study
that
my
teaching
and
the
strong
course
of
my
authority
might
go
one
way
and
safely
and
the
end
was
ever
to
do
well
nor
is
there
living
i
speak
it
with
a
single
heart
my
lords
a
man
that
more
detests
more
stirs
against
both
in
his
private
conscience
and
his
place
defacers
of
a
public
peace
than
i
do
pray
heaven
the
king
may
never
find
a
heart
with
less
allegiance
in
it
men
that
make
envy
and
crooked
malice
nourishment
dare
bite
the
best
i
do
beseech
your
lordships
that
in
this
case
of
justice
my
accusers
be
what
they
will
may
stand
forth
face
to
face
and
freely
urge
against
me
nay
my
lord
that
cannot
be
you
are
a
counsellor
and
by
that
virtue
no
man
dare
accuse
you
my
lord
because
we
have
business
of
more
moment
we
will
be
short
with
you
tis
his
highness
pleasure
and
our
consent
for
better
trial
of
you
from
hence
you
be
committed
to
the
tower
where
being
but
a
private
man
again
you
shall
know
many
dare
accuse
you
boldly
more
than
i
fear
you
are
provided
for
ah
my
good
lord
of
winchester
i
thank
you
you
are
always
my
good
friend
if
your
will
pass
i
shall
both
find
your
lordship
judge
and
juror
you
are
so
merciful
i
see
your
end
tis
my
undoing
love
and
meekness
lord
become
a
churchman
better
than
ambition
win
straying
souls
with
modesty
again
cast
none
away
that
i
shall
clear
myself
lay
all
the
weight
ye
can
upon
my
patience
i
make
as
little
doubt
as
you
do
conscience
in
doing
daily
wrongs
i
could
say
more
but
reverence
to
your
calling
makes
me
modest
my
lord
my
lord
you
are
a
sectary
thats
the
plain
truth
your
painted
gloss
discovers
to
men
that
understand
you
words
and
weakness
my
lord
of
winchester
you
are
a
little
by
your
good
favour
too
sharp
men
so
noble
however
faulty
yet
should
find
respect
for
what
they
have
been
tis
a
cruelty
to
load
a
falling
man
good
master
secretary
i
cry
your
honour
mercy
you
may
worst
of
all
this
table
say
so
why
my
lord
do
not
i
know
you
for
a
favourer
of
this
new
sect
ye
are
not
sound
not
sound
not
sound
i
say
would
you
were
half
so
honest
mens
prayers
then
would
seek
you
not
their
fears
i
shall
remember
this
bold
language
do
remember
your
bold
life
too
this
is
too
much
forbear
for
shame
my
lords
i
have
done
and
i
then
thus
for
you
my
lord
it
stands
agreed
i
take
it
by
all
voices
that
forthwith
you
be
conveyd
to
the
tower
a
prisoner
there
to
remain
till
the
kings
further
pleasure
be
known
unto
us
are
you
all
agreed
lords
we
are
is
there
no
other
way
of
mercy
but
i
must
needs
to
the
tower
my
lords
what
other
would
you
expect
you
are
strangely
troublesome
let
some
o
the
guard
be
ready
there
for
me
must
i
go
like
a
traitor
thither
receive
him
and
see
him
safe
i
the
tower
stay
good
my
lords
i
have
a
little
yet
to
say
look
there
my
lords
by
virtue
of
that
ring
i
take
my
cause
out
of
the
gripes
of
cruel
men
and
give
it
to
a
most
noble
judge
the
king
my
master
this
is
the
kings
ring
tis
no
counterfeit
tis
the
right
ring
by
heaven
i
told
ye
all
when
we
first
put
this
dangerous
stone
arolling
twould
fall
upon
ourselves
do
you
think
my
lords
the
king
will
suffer
but
the
little
finger
of
this
man
to
be
vexd
tis
now
too
certain
how
much
more
is
his
life
in
value
with
him
would
i
were
fairly
out
ont
my
mind
gave
me
in
seeking
tales
and
informations
against
this
man
whose
honesty
the
devil
and
his
disciples
only
envy
at
ye
blew
the
fire
that
burns
ye
now
have
at
ye
dread
sovereign
how
much
are
we
bound
to
heaven
in
daily
thanks
that
gave
us
such
a
prince
not
only
good
and
wise
but
most
religious
one
that
in
all
obedience
makes
the
church
the
chief
aim
of
his
honour
and
to
strengthen
that
holy
duty
out
of
dear
respect
his
royal
self
in
judgment
comes
to
hear
the
cause
betwixt
her
and
this
great
offender
you
were
ever
good
at
sudden
commendations
bishop
of
winchester
but
know
i
come
not
to
hear
such
flattery
now
and
in
my
presence
they
are
too
thin
and
bare
to
hide
offences
to
me
you
cannot
reach
you
play
the
spaniel
and
think
with
wagging
of
your
tongue
to
win
me
but
whatsoeer
thou
takst
me
for
im
sure
thou
hast
a
cruel
nature
and
a
bloody
good
man
sit
down
now
let
me
see
the
proudest
he
that
dares
most
but
wag
his
finger
at
thee
by
all
thats
holy
he
had
better
starve
than
but
once
think
this
place
becomes
thee
not
may
it
please
your
grace
no
sir
it
does
not
please
me
i
had
thought
i
had
had
men
of
some
understanding
and
wisdom
of
my
council
but
i
find
none
was
it
discretion
lords
to
let
this
man
this
good
man
few
of
you
deserve
that
title
this
honest
man
wait
like
a
lousy
footboy
at
chamberdoor
and
one
as
great
as
you
are
why
what
a
shame
was
this
did
my
commission
bid
ye
so
far
forget
yourselves
i
gave
ye
power
as
he
was
a
counsellor
to
try
him
not
as
a
groom
theres
some
of
ye
i
see
more
out
of
malice
than
integrity
would
try
him
to
the
utmost
had
ye
mean
which
ye
shall
never
have
while
i
live
thus
far
my
most
dread
sovreign
may
it
like
your
grace
to
let
my
tongue
excuse
all
what
was
purposd
concerning
his
imprisonment
was
rather
if
there
be
faith
in
men
meant
for
his
trial
and
fair
purgation
to
the
world
than
malice
im
sure
in
me
well
well
my
lords
respect
him
take
him
and
use
him
well
hes
worthy
of
it
i
will
say
thus
much
for
him
if
a
prince
may
be
beholding
to
a
subject

am
for
his
love
and

a
thousand
here

father
godfather
and
all
together
the
spoons
will
be
the
bigger
sir
there
is
a
fellow
somewhat
near
the
door
he
should
be
a
brazier
by
his
face
for
o
my
conscience
twenty
of
the
dog
days
now
reign
ins
nose
all
that
stand
about
him
are
under
the
line
they
need
no
other
penance
that
firedrake
did
i
hit
three
times
on
the
head
and
three
times
was
his
nose
discharged
against
me
he
stands
there
like
a
mortarpiece
to
blow
us
there
was
a
haberdashers
wife
of
small
wit
near
him
that
railed
upon
me
till
her
pinked
porringer
fell
off
her
head
for
kindling
such
a
combustion
in
the
state
i
missed
the
meteor
once
and
hit
that
woman
who
cried
out
clubs
when
i
might
see
from
far
some
forty
truncheoners
draw
to
her
succour
which
were
the
hope
o
the
strand
where
she
was
quartered
they
fell
on
i
made
good
my
place
at
length
they
came
to
the
broomstaff
to
me
i
defied
em
still
when
suddenly
a
file
of
boys
behind
em
loose
shot
delivered
such
a
shower
of
pebbles
that
i
was
fain
to
draw
mine
honour
in
and
let
em
win
the
work
the
devil
was
amongst
em
i
think
surely
these
are
the
youths
that
thunder
at
a
playhouse
and
fight
for
bitten
apples
that
no
audience
but
the
tribulation
of
towerhill
or
the
limbs
of
limehouse
their
dear
brothers
are
able
to
endure
i
have
some
of
em
in
limbo
patrum

there
they
are
like
to
dance
these
three
days

the
running
banquet
of
two
beadles

to

not
done
neither
that
i
fear
all
the
expected
good
were
like
to
hear
for
this
play
at
this
time
is
only
in
the
merciful
construction
of

such
a
one

if
they
smile
and

clap
the
first
part
of
king
henry
iv
so
shaken
as
we
are
so
wan
with
care

we
a
time
for
frighted
peace
to
pant
and
breathe
shortwinded
accents
of
new
broils
to
be
commencd
in
stronds
afar
remote
no
more
the
thirsty
entrance
of
this
soil
shall
daub
her
lips
with
her
own
childrens
blood
no
more
shall
trenching
war
channel
her
fields
nor
bruise
her
flowerets
with
the
armed
hoofs
of
hostile
paces
those
opposed
eyes
which
like
the
meteors
of
a
troubled
heaven
all
of
one
nature
of
one
substance
bred
did
lately
meet
in
the
intestine
shock
and
furious
close
of
civil
butchery
shall
now
in
mutual
wellbeseeming
ranks
march
all
one
way
and
be
no
more
opposd
against
acquaintance
kindred
and
allies
the
edge
of
war
like
an
illsheathed
knife
no
more
shall
cut
his
master
therefore
friends
as
far
as
to
the
sepulchre
of
christ
whose
soldier
now
under
whose
blessed
cross
we
are
impressed
and
engagd
to
fight
forthwith
a
power
of
english
shall
we
levy
whose
arms
were
moulded
in
their
mothers
womb
to
chase
these
pagans
in
those
holy
fields
over
whose
acres
walkd
those
blessed
feet
which
fourteen
hundred
years
ago
were
naild
for
our
advantage
on
the
bitter
cross
but
this
our
purpose
is
a
twelvemonth
old
and
bootless
tis
to
tell
you
we
will
go
therefore
we
meet
not
now
then
let
me
hear
of
you
my
gentle
cousin
westmoreland
what
yesternight
our
council
did
decree
in
forwarding
this
dear
expedience
my
liege
this
haste
was
hot
in
question
and
many
limits
of
the
charge
set
down
but
yesternight
when
all
athwart
there
came
a
post
from
wales
loaden
with
heavy
news
whose
worst
was
that
the
noble
mortimer
leading
the
men
of
herefordshire
to
fight
against
the
irregular
and
wild
glendower
was
by
the
rude
hands
of
that
welshman
taken
and
a
thousand
of
his
people
butchered
upon
whose
dead
corpse
there
was
such
misuse
such
beastly
shameless
transformation
by
those
welshwomen
done
as
may
not
be
without
much
shame
retold
or
spoken
of
it
seems
then
that
the
tidings
of
this
broil
brake
off
our
business
for
the
holy
land
this
matchd
with
other
like
my
gracious
lord
for
more
uneven
and
unwelcome
news
came
from
the
north
and
thus
it
did
import
on
holyrood
day
the
gallant
hotspur
there
young
harry
percy
and
brave
archibald
that
evervaliant
and
approved
scot
at
holmedon
met
where
they
did
spend
a
sad
and
bloody
hour
as
by
discharge
of
their
artillery
and
shape
of
likelihood
the
news
was
told
for
he
that
brought
them
in
the
very
heat
and
pride
of
their
contention
did
take
horse
uncertain
of
the
issue
any
way
here
is
a
dear
and
true
industrious
friend
sir
walter
blunt
new
lighted
from
his
horse
staind
with
the
variation
of
each
soil

spirit
of
persuasion
and
him
the
ears

countenance
farewell
you

find
me
in
eastcheap
farewell
thou
latter
spring
farewell
allhallown
summer
now
my
good
sweet
honey
lord
ride
with
us
tomorrow
i
have
a
jest
to
execute
that
i
cannot
manage
alone
falstaff
bardolph
peto
and
gadshill
shall
rob
those
men
that
we
have
already
waylaid
yourself
and
i
will
not
be
there
and
when
they
have
the
booty
if
you
and
i
do
not
rob
them
cut
this
head
from
my
shoulders
but
how
shall
we
part
with
them
in
setting
forth
why
we
will
set
forth
before
or
after
them
and
appoint
them
a
place
of
meeting
wherein
it
is
at
our
pleasure
to
fail
and
then
will
they
adventure
upon
the
exploit
themselves
which
they
shall
have
no
sooner
achieved
but
well
set
upon
them
yea
but
tis
like
that
they
will
know
us
by
our
horses
by
our
habits
and
by
every
other
appointment
to
be
ourselves
tut
our
horses
they
shall
not
see
ill
tie
them
in
the
wood
our
vizards
we
will
change
after
we
leave
them
and
sirrah
i
have
cases
of
buckram
for
the
nonce
to
inmask
our
noted
outward
garments
yea
but
i
doubt
they
will
be
too
hard
for
us
well
for
two
of
them
i
know
them
to
be
as
truebred
cowards
as
ever
turned
back
and
for
the
third
if
he
fight
longer
than
he
sees
reason
ill
forswear
arms
the
virtue
of
this
jest
will
be
the
incomprehensible
lies
that
this
same
fat
rogue
will
tell
us
when
we
meet
at
supper
how
thirty
at
least
he
fought
with
what
wards
what
blows
what
extremities
he
endured
and
in
the
reproof
of
this
lies
the
jest
well
ill
go
with
thee
provide
us
all
things
necessary
and
meet
me
tomorrow
night
in
eastcheap
there
ill
sup
farewell
farewell
my
lord
i
know
you
all
and
will
awhile
uphold
the
unyokd
humour
of
your
idleness
yet
herein
will
i
imitate
the
sun
who
doth
permit
the
base
contagious
clouds
to
smother
up
his
beauty
from
the
world
that
when
he
please
again
to
be
himself
being
wanted
he
may
be
more
wonderd
at
by
breaking
through
the
foul
and
ugly
mists
of
vapours
that
did
seem
to
strangle
him
if
all
the
year
were
playing
holidays
to
sport
would
be
as
tedious
as
to
work
but
when
they
seldom
come
they
wishd
for
come
and
nothing
pleaseth
but
rare
accidents
so
when
this
loose
behaviour
i
throw
off
and
pay
the
debt
i
never
promised
by
how
much
better
than
my
word
i
am
by
so
much
shall
i
falsify
mens
hopes
and
like
bright
metal
on
a
sullen
ground
my
reformation
glittering
oer
my
fault
shall
show
more
goodly
and
attract
more
eyes
than
that
which
hath
no
foil
to
set
it
off
ill
so
offend
to
make
offence
a
skill
redeeming
time
when
men
think
least
i
will
my
blood
hath
been
too
cold
and
temperate
unapt
to
stir
at
these
indignities
and
you
have
found
me
for
accordingly
you
tread
upon
my
patience
but
be
sure
i
will
from
henceforth
rather
be
myself
mighty
and
to
be
feard
than
my
condition
which
hath
been
smooth
as
oil
soft
as
young
down
and
therefore
lost
that
title
of
respect
which
the
proud
soul
neer
pays
but
to
the
proud
our
house
my
sovereign
liege
little
deserves
the
scourge
of
greatness
to
be
usd
on
it
and
that
same
greatness
too
which
our
own
hands
have
holp
to
make
so
portly
my
lord
worcester
get
thee
gone
for
i
do
see
danger
and
disobedience
in
thine
eye
o
sir
your
presence
is
too
bold
and
peremptory
and
majesty
might
never
yet
endure
the
moody
frontier
of
a
servant
brow
you
have
good
leave
to
leave
us
when
we
need
your
use
and
counsel
we
shall
send
for
you
you
were
about
to
speak
yea
my
good
lord
those
prisoners
in
your
highness
name
demanded
which
harry
percy
here
at
holmedon
took
were
as
he
says
not
with
such
strength
denied
as
is
deliverd
to
your
majesty
either
envy
therefore
or
misprision
is
guilty
of
this
fault
and
not
my
son
my
liege
i
did
deny
no
prisoners
but
i
remember
when
the
fight
was
done
when
i
was
dry
with
rage
and
extreme
toil
breathless
and
faint
leaning
upon
my
sword
came
there
a
certain
lord
neat
and
trimly
dressd
fresh
as
a
bridegroom
and
his
chin
new
reapd
showd
like
a
stubbleland
at
harvesthome
he
was
perfumed
like
a
milliner
and
twixt
his
finger
and
his
thumb
he
held
a
pouncetbox
which
ever
and
anon
he
gave
his
nose
and
tookt
away
again
who
therewith
angry
when
it
next
came
there
took
it
in
snuff
and
still
he
smild
and
talkd
and
as
the
soldiers
bore
dead
bodies
by
he
calld
them
untaught
knaves
unmannerly
to
bring
a
slovenly
unhandsome
corpse
betwixt
the
wind
and
his
nobility
with
many
holiday
and
lady
terms
he
questiond
me
among
the
rest
demanded
my
prisoners
in
your
majestys
behalf
i
then
all
smarting
with
my
wounds
being
cold
to
be
so
pesterd
with
a
popinjay
out
of
my
grief
and
my
impatience
answerd
neglectingly
i
know
not
what
he
should
or
he
should
not
for
he
made
me
mad
to
see
him
shine
so
brisk
and
smell
so
sweet
and
talk
so
like
a
waitinggentlewoman
of
guns
and
drums
and
wounds
god
save
the
mark
and
telling
me
the
sovereignst
thing
on
earth
was
parmaceti
for
an
inward
bruise
and
that
it
was
great
pity
so
it
was
this
villanous
saltpetre
should
be
diggd
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
harmless
earth
which
many
a
good
tall
fellow
had
destroyd
so
cowardly
and
but
for
these
vile
guns
he
would
himself
have
been
a
soldier
this
bald
unjointed
chat
of
his
my
lord
i
answerd
indirectly
as
i
said
and
i
beseech
you
let
not
his
report
come
current
for
an
accusation
betwixt
my
love
and
your
high
majesty
the
circumstance
considerd
good
my
lord
whatever
harry
percy
then
had
said
to
such
a
person
and
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
with
all
the
rest
retold
may
reasonably
die
and
never
rise
to
do
him
wrong
or
any
way
impeach
what
then
he
said
so
he
unsay
it
now
why
yet
he
doth
deny
his
prisoners
but
with
proviso
and
exception
that
we
at
our
own
charge
shall
ransom
straight
his
brotherinlaw
the
foolish
mortimer
who
on
my
soul
hath
wilfully
betrayd
the
lives
of
those
that
he
did
lead
to
fight
against
the
great
magician
damnd
glendower
whose
daughter
as
we
hear
the
earl
of
march
hath
lately
married
shall
our
coffers
then
be
emptied
to
redeem
a
traitor
home
shall
we
buy
treason
and
indent
with
fears
when
they
have
lost
and
forfeited
themselves
no
on
the
barren
mountains
let
him
starve
for
i
shall
never
hold
that
man
my
friend
whose
tongue
shall
ask
me
for
one
penny
cost
to
ransom
home
revolted
mortimer
revolted
mortimer
he
never
did
fall
off
my
sovereign
liege
but
by
the
chance
of
war
to
prove
that
true
needs
no
more
but
one
tongue
for
all
those
wounds
those
mouthed
wounds
which
valiantly
he
took
when
on
the
gentle
severns
sedgy
bank
in
single
opposition
hand
to
hand
he
did
confound
the
best
part
of
an
hour
in
changing
hardiment
with
great
glendower
three
times
they
breathd
and
three
times
did
they
drink
upon
agreement
of
swift
severns
flood
who
then
affrighted
with
their
bloody
looks
ran
fearfully
among
the
trembling
reeds
and
hid
his
crisp
head
in
the
hollow
bank
bloodstained
with
these
valiant
combatants
never
did
base
and
rotten
policy
colour
her
working
with
such
deadly
wounds
nor
never
could
the
noble
mortimer
receive
so
many
and
all
willingly
then
let
him
not
be
slanderd
with
revolt
thou
dost
belie
him
percy
thou
dost
belie
him
he
never
did
encounter
with
glendower
i
tell
thee
he
durst
as
well
have
met
the
devil
alone
as
owen
glendower
for
an
enemy
art
thou
not
ashamd
but
sirrah
henceforth
let
me
not
hear
you
speak
of
mortimer
send
me
your
prisoners
with
the
speediest
means
or
you
shall
hear
in
such
a
kind
from
me
as
will
displease
you
my
lord
northumberland
we
license
your
departure
with
your
son
send
us
your
prisoners
or
youll
hear
of
it
an
if
the
devil
come
and
roar
for
them
i
will
not
send
them
i
will
after
straight
and
tell
him
so
for
i
will
ease
my
heart
albeit
i
make
a
hazard
of
my
head
what
drunk
with
choler
stay
and
pause
awhile
here
comes
your
uncle
speak
of
mortimer
zounds
i
will
speak
of
him
and
let
my
soul
want
mercy
if
i
do
not
join
with
him
in
his
behalf
ill
empty
all
these
veins
and
shed
my
dear
blood
drop
by
drop
i
the
dust
but
i
will
lift
the
downtrod
mortimer
as
high
i
the
air
as
this
unthankful
king
as
this
ingrate
and
cankerd
bolingbroke
brother
the
king
hath
made
your
nephew
mad
who
struck
this
heat
up
after
i
was
gone
he
will
forsooth
have
all
my
prisoners
and
when
i
urgd
the
ransom
once
again
of
my
wifes
brother
then
his
cheek
lookd
pale
and
on
my
face
he
turnd
an
eye
of
death
trembling
even
at
the
name
of
mortimer
i
cannot
blame
him
was
he
not
proclaimd
by
richard
that
dead
is
the
next
of
blood
he
was
i
heard
the
proclamation
and
then
it
was
when
the
unhappy
king
whose
wrongs
in
us
god
pardon
did
set
forth
upon
his
irish
expedition
from
whence
he
intercepted
did
return
to
be
deposd
and
shortly
murdered
and
for
whose
death
we
in
the
worlds
wide
mouth
live
scandalizd
and
foully
spoken
of
but
soft
i
pray
you
did
king
richard
then
proclaim
my
brother
edmund
mortimer
heir
to
the
crown
he
did
myself
did
hear
it
nay
then
i
cannot
blame
his
cousin
king
that
wishd
him
on
the
barren
mountains
starve
but
shall
it
be
that
you
that
set
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
this
forgetful
man
and
for
his
sake
wear
the
detested
blot
of
murdrous
subornation
shall
it
be
that
you
a
world
of
curses
undergo
being
the
agents
or
base
second
means
the
cords
the
ladder
or
the
hangman
rather
o
pardon
me
that
i
descend
so
low
to
show
the
line
and
the
predicament
wherein
you
range
under
this
subtle
king
shall
it
for
shame
be
spoken
in
these
days
or
fill
up
chronicles
in
time
to
come
that
men
of
your
nobility
and
power
did
gage
them
both
inan
unjust
behalf
as
both
of
you
god
pardon
it
have
done
to
put
down
richard
that
sweet
lovely
rose
and
plant
this
thorn
this
canker
bolingbroke
and
shall
it
in
more
shame
be
further
spoken
that
you
are
foold
discarded
and
shook
off
by
him
for
whom
these
shames
ye
underwent
no
yet
time
serves
wherein
you
may
redeem
your
banishd
honours
and
restore
yourselves
into
the
good
thoughts
of
the
world
again
revenge
the
jeering
and
disdaind
contempt
of
this
proud
king
who
studies
day
and
night
to
answer
all
the
debt
he
owes
to
you
even
with
the
bloody
payment
of
your
deaths
therefore
i
say
peace
cousin
say
no
more
and
now
i
will
unclasp
a
secret
book
and
to
your
quickconceiving
discontents
ill
read
you
matter
deep
and
dangerous
as
full
of
peril
and
adventurous
spirit
as
to
oerwalk
a
current
roaring
loud
on
the
unsteadfast
footing
of
a
spear
if
he
fall
in
good
night
or
sink
or
swim
send
danger
from
the
east
unto
the
west
so
honour
cross
it
from
the
north
to
south
and
let
them
grapple
o
the
blood
more
stirs
to
rouse
a
lion
than
to
start
a
hare
imagination
of
some
great
exploit
drives
him
beyond
the
bounds
of
patience
by
heaven
methinks
it
were
an
easy
leap
to
pluck
bright
honour
from
the
palefacd
moon
or
dive
into
the
bottom
of
the
deep
where
fathomline
could
never
touch
the
ground
and
pluck
up
drowned
honour
by
the
locks
so
he
that
doth
redeem
her
thence
might
wear
without
corrival
all
her
dignities
but
out
upon
this
halffacd
fellowship
he
apprehends
a
world
of
figures
here
but
not
the
form
of
what
he
should
attend
good
cousin
give
me
audience
for
a
while
i
cry
you
mercy
those
same
noble
scots
that
are
your
prisoners
ill
keep
them
all
by
god
he
shall
not
have
a
scot
of
them
no
if
a
scot
would
save
his
soul
he
shall
not
ill
keep
them
by
this
hand
you
start
away
and
lend
no
ear
unto
my
purposes
those
prisoners
you
shall
keep
nay
i
will
thats
flat
he
said
he
would
not
ransom
mortimer
forbade
my
tongue
to
speak
of
mortimer
but
i
will
find
him
when
he
lies
asleep
and
in
his
ear
ill
holla
mortimer
nay
ill
have
a
starling
shall
be
taught
to
speak
nothing
but
mortimer
and
give
it
him
to
keep
his
anger
still
in
motion
hear
you
cousin
a
word
all
studies
here
i
solemnly
defy
save
how
to
gall
and
pinch
this
bolingbroke
and
that
same
swordandbuckler
prince
of
wales
but
that
i
think
his
father
loves
him
not
and
would
be
glad
he
met
with
some
mischance
i
would
have
him
poisond
with
a
pot
of
ale
farewell
kinsman
i
will
talk
to
you
when
you
are
better
temperd
to
attend
why
what
a
waspstung
and
impatient
fool
art
thou
to
break
into
this
womans
mood
tying
thine
ear
to
no
tongue
but
thine
own
why
look
you
i
am
whippd
and
scourgd
with
rods
nettled
and
stung
with
pismires
when
i
hear
of
this
vile
politician
bolingbroke
in
richards
time
what
do
ye
call
the
place
a
plague
upont
it
is
in
gloucestershire
twas
where
the
madcap
duke
his
uncle
kept
his
uncle
york
where
i
first
bowd
my
knee
unto
this
king
of
smiles
this
bolingbroke
sblood
when
you
and
he
came
back
from
ravenspurgh
at
berkeley
castle
you
say
true
why
what
a
candy
deal
of
courtesy
this
fawning
greyhound
then
did
proffer
me
look
when
his
infant
fortune
came
to
age
and
gentle
harry
percy
and
kind
cousin
o
the
devil
take
such
cozeners
god
forgive
me
good
uncle
tell
your
tale
for
i
have
done
nay
if
you
have
not
tot
again
well
stay
your
leisure
i
have
done
i
faith
then
once
more
to
your
scottish
prisoners
deliver
them
up
without
their
ransom
straight
and
make
the
douglas
son
your
only
mean
for
powers
in
scotland
which
for
divers
reasons
which
i
shall
send
you
written
be
assurd
will
easily
be
granted
you
my
lord
your
son
in
scotland
being
thus
employd
shall
secretly
into
the
bosom
creep
of
that
same
noble
prelate
well
belovd
the
archbishop
of
york
is
it
not
true
who
bears
hard
his
brothers
death
at
bristol
the
lord
scroop
i
speak
not
this
in
estimation
as
what
i
think
might
be
but
what
i
know
is
ruminated
plotted
and
set
down
and
only
stays
but
to
behold
the
face
of
that
occasion
that
shall
bring
it
on
i
smell
it
upon
my
life
it
will
do
wondrous
well
before
the
games
afoot
thou
still
lettst
slip
why
it
cannot
choose
but
be
a
noble
plot
and
then
the
power
of
scotland
and
of
york
to
join
with
mortimer
ha
and
so
they
shall
in
faith
it
is
exceedingly
well
aimd
and
tis
no
little
reason
bids
us
speed
to
save
our
heads
by
raising
of
a
head
for
bear
ourselves
as
even
as
we
can
the
king
will
always
think
him
in
our
debt
and
think
we
think
ourselves
unsatisfied
till
he
hath
found
a
time
to
pay
us
home
and
see
already
how
he
doth
begin
to
make
us
strangers
to
his
looks
of
love
he
does
he
does
well
be
revengd
on
him

dangerous
the
friends

named
uncertain
the
time

your
whole
plot
too
light
for
the
counterpoise
of
so
great
an
opposition

of

marvel
where

accompanied
for
though
the
camomile
the
more
it
is
trodden
on
the
faster
it
grows
yet
youth
the
more
it
is
wasted
the
sooner
it
wears
that
thou
art
my
son
i
have
partly
thy
mothers
word
partly
my
own
opinion
but
chiefly
a
villanous
trick
of
thine
eye
and
a
foolish
hanging
of
thy
nether
lip
that
doth
warrant
me
if
then
thou
be
son
to
me
here
lies
the
point
why
being
son
to
me
art
thou
so
pointed
at
shall
the
blessed
sun
of
heaven
prove
a
micher
and
eat
blackberries
a
question
not
to
be
asked
shall
the
son
of
england
prove
a
thief
and
take
purses
a
question
to
be
asked
there
is
a
thing
harry
which
thou
hast
often
heard
of
and
it
is
known
to
many
in
our
land
by
the
name
of
pitch
this
pitch
as
ancient
writers
do
report
doth
defile
so
doth
the
company
thou
keepest
for
harry
now
i
do
not
speak
to
thee
in
drink
but
in
tears
not
in
pleasure
but
in
passion
not
in
words
only
but
in
woes
also
and
yet
there
is
a
virtuous
man
whom
i
have
often
noted
in
thy
company
but
i
know
not
his
name
what
manner
of
man
an
it
like
your
majesty
a
goodly
portly
man
i
faith
and
a
corpulent
of
a
cheerful
look
a
pleasing
eye
and
a
most
noble
carriage
and
as
i
think
his
age
some
fifty
or
byr
lady
inclining
to
threescore
and
now
i
remember
me
his
name
is
falstaff
if
that
man
should
be
lewdly
given
he
deceiveth
me
for
harry
i
see
virtue
in
his
looks
if
then
the
tree
may
be
known
by
the
fruit
as
the
fruit
by
the
tree
then
peremptorily
i
speak
it
there
is
virtue
in
that
falstaff
him
keep
with
the
rest
banish
and
tell
me
now
thou
naughty
varlet
tell
me
where
hast
thou
been

king

it
half
so
gravely

majestically

me
up
by
the
heels
for
a
rabbitsucker

poulters
hare

good
my
lord
these
promises
are
fair
the
parties
sure
and
our
induction
full
of
prosperous
hope
lord
mortimer
and
cousin
glendower
will
you
sit
down
and
uncle
worcester
a
plague
upon
it
i
have
forgot
the
map
no
here
it
is
sit
cousin
percy
sit
good
cousin
hotspur
for
by
that
name
as
oft
as
lancaster
doth
speak
of
you
his
cheek
looks
pale
and
with
a
rising
sigh
he
wishes
you
in
heaven
and
you
in
hell
as
often
as
he
hears
owen
glendower
spoke
of
i
cannot
blame
him
at
my
nativity
the
front
of
heaven
was
full
of
fiery
shapes
of
burning
cressets
and
at
my
birth
the
frame
and
huge
foundation
of
the
earth
shakd
like
a
coward
why
so
it
would
have
done
at
the
same
season
if
your
mothers
cat
had
but
kittened
though
yourself
had
never
been
born
i
say
the
earth
did
shake
when
i
was
born
and
i
say
the
earth
was
not
of
my
mind
if
you
suppose
as
fearing
you
it
shook
the
heavens
were
all
on
fire
the
earth
did
tremble
o
then
the
earth
shook
to
see
the
heavens
on
fire
and
not
in
fear
of
your
nativity
diseased
nature
oftentimes
breaks
forth
in
strange
eruptions
oft
the
teeming
earth
is
with
a
kind
of
colic
pinchd
and
vexd
by
the
imprisoning
of
unruly
wind
within
her
womb
which
for
enlargement
striving
shakes
the
old
beldam
earth
and
topples
down
steeples
and
mossgrown
towers
at
your
birth
our
grandam
earth
having
this
distemperature
in
passion
shook
cousin
of
many
men
i
do
not
bear
these
crossings
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
once
again
that
at
my
birth
the
front
of
heaven
was
full
of
fiery
shapes
the
goats
ran
from
the
mountains
and
the
herds
were
strangely
clamorous
to
the
frighted
fields
these
signs
have
markd
me
extraordinary
and
all
the
courses
of
my
life
do
show
i
am
not
in
the
roll
of
common
men
where
is
he
living
clippd
in
with
the
sea
that
chides
the
banks
of
england
scotland
wales
which
calls
me
pupil
or
hath
read
to
me
and
bring
him
out
that
is
but
womans
son
can
trace
me
in
the
tedious
ways
of
art
and
hold
me
pace
in
deep
experiments
i
think
theres
no
man
speaks
better
welsh
ill
to
dinner
peace
cousin
percy
you
will
make
him
mad
i
can
call
spirits
from
the
vasty
deep
why
so
can
i
or
so
can
any
man
but
will
they
come
when
you
do
call
for
them
why
i
can
teach
thee
cousin
to
command
the
devil
and
i
can
teach
thee
coz
to
shame
the
devil
by
telling
truth
tell
truth
and
shame
the
devil
if
thou
have
power
to
raise
him
bring
him
hither
and
ill
be
sworn
i
have
power
to
shame
him
hence
o
while
you
live
tell
truth

devil

at
shrewsbury
my
father
glendower

not
ready
yet
nor

we
need
his
help
these
fourteen
days
within
that
space
you
may
have
drawn
together
your
tenants
friends
and
neighbouring
gentlemen
a
shorter
time
shall
send
me
to
you
lords
and
in
my
conduct
shall
your
ladies
come
from
whom
you
now
must
steal
and
take
no
leave
for
there
will
be
a
world
of
water
shed
upon
the
parting
of
your
wives
and
you
methinks
my
moiety
north
from
burton
here
in
quantity
equals
not
one
of
yours
see
how
this
river
comes
me
cranking
in
and
cuts
me
from
the
best
of
all
my
land
a
huge
halfmoon
a
monstrous
cantle
out
ill
have
the
current
in
this
place
dammd
up
and
here
the
smug
and
silver
trent
shall
run
in
a
new
channel
fair
and
evenly
it
shall
not
wind
with
such
a
deep
indent
to
rob
me
of
so
rich
a
bottom
here
not
wind
it
shall
it
must
you
see
it
doth
yea
but
mark
how
he
bears
his
course
and
runs
me
up
with
like
advantage
on
the
other
side
gelding
the
opposed
continent
as
much
as
on
the
other
side
it
takes
from
you
yea
but
a
little
charge
will
trench
him
here
and
on
this
north
side
win
this
cape
of
land
and
then
he
runs
straight
and
even
ill
have
it
so
a
little
charge
will
do
it
i
will
not
have
it
alterd
will
not
you
no
nor
you
shall
not
who
shall
say
me
nay
why
that
will
i
let
me
not
understand
you
then
speak
it
in
welsh
i
can
speak
english
lord
as
well
as
you
for
i
was
traind
up
in
the
english
court
where
being
but
young
i
framed
to
the
harp
many
an
english
ditty
lovely
well
and
gave
the
tongue
an
helpful
ornament
a
virtue
that
was
never
seen
in
you
marry
and
im
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
i
had
rather
be
a
kitten
and
cry
mew
than
one
of
these
same
metre
balladmongers
i
had
rather
hear
a
brazen
canstick
turnd
or
a
dry
wheel
grate
on
the
axletree
and
that
would
set
my
teeth
nothing
on
edge
nothing
so
much
as
mincing
poetry
tis
like
the
forcd
gait
of
a
shuffling
nag
come
you
shall
have
trent
turnd
i
do
not
care
ill
give
thrice
so
much
land
to
any
welldeserving
friend
but
in
the
way
of
bargain
mark
you
me
ill
cavil
on
the
ninth
part
of
a
hair
are
the
indentures
drawn
shall
we
be
gone
the
moon
shines
fair
you
may
away
by
night
ill
haste
the
writer
and
withal
break
with
your
wives
of
your
departure
hence
i
am
afraid
my
daughter
will
run
mad
so
much
she
doteth
on
her
mortimer
fie
cousin
percy
how
you
cross
my
father
i
cannot
choose
sometimes
he
angers
me
with
telling
me
of
the
moldwarp
and
the
ant
of
the
dreamer
merlin
and
his
prophecies
and
of
a
dragon
and
a
finless
fish
a
clipwingd
griffin
and
a
moulten
raven
a
couching
lion
and
a
ramping
cat
and
such
a
deal
of
skimbleskamble
stuff
as
puts
me
from
my
faith
ill
tell
thee
what
he
held
me
last
night
at
least
nine
hours
in
reckoning
up
the
several
devils
names
that
were
his
lackeys
i
cried
hum
and
well
go
to
but
markd
him
not
a
word
o
hes
as
tedious
as
a
tired
horse
a
railing
wife
worse
than
a
smoky
house
i
had
rather
live
with
cheese
and
garlick
in
a
windmill
far
than
feed
on
cates
and
have
him
talk
to
me
in
any
summerhouse
in
christendom
in
faith
he
is
a
worthy
gentleman
exceedingly
well
read
and
profited
in
strange
concealments
valiant
as
a
lion
and
wondrous
affable
and
as
bountiful
as
mines
of
india
shall
i
tell
you
cousin
he
holds
your
temper
in
a
high
respect
and
curbs
himself
even
of
his
natural
scope
when
you
do
cross
his
humour
faith
he
does
i
warrant
you
that
man
is
not
alive
might
so
have
tempted
him
as
you
have
done
without
the
taste
of
danger
and
reproof
but
do
not
use
it
oft
let
me
entreat
you
in
faith
my
lord
you
are
too
wilfulblame
and
since
your
coming
hither
have
done
enough
to
put
him
quite
beside
his
patience
you
must
needs
learn
lord
to
amend
this
fault
though
sometimes
it
show
greatness
courage
blood
and
thats
the
dearest
grace
it
renders
you
yet
oftentimes
it
doth
present
harsh
rage
defect
of
manners
want
of
government
pride
haughtiness
opinion
and
disdain
the
least
of
which
haunting
a
nobleman
loseth
mens
hearts
and
leaves
behind
a
stain
upon
the
beauty
of
all
parts
besides
beguiling
them
of
commendation
well
i
am
schoold
good
manners
be
your
speed

wives

and
then
to
horse
immediately
with
all
my
heart
lords
give
us
leave
the
prince
of
wales
and
i
must
have
some
private
conference
but
be
near
at
hand
for
we
shall
presently
have
need
of
you
i
know
not
whether
god
will
have
it
so
for
some
displeasing
service
i
have
done
that
in
his
secret
doom
out
of
my
blood
hell
breed
revengement
and
a
scourge
for
me
but
thou
dost
in
thy
passages
of
life
make
me
believe
that
thou
art
only
markd
for
the
hot
vengeance
and
the
rod
of
heaven
to
punish
my
mistreadings
tell
me
else
could
such
inordinate
and
low
desires
such
poor
such
bare
such
lewd
such
mean
attempts
such
barren
pleasures
rude
society
as
thou
art
matchd
withal
and
grafted
to
accompany
the
greatness
of
thy
blood
and
hold
their
level
with
thy
princely
heart
so
please
your
majesty
i
would
i
could
quit
all
offences
with
as
clear
excuse
as
well
as
i
am
doubtless
i
can
purge
myself
of
many
i
am
chargd
withal
yet
such
extenuation
let
me
beg
as
in
reproof
of
many
tales
devisd
which
oft
the
ear
of
greatness
needs
must
hear
by
smiling
pickthanks
and
base
newsmongers
i
may
for
some
things
true
wherein
my
youth
hath
faulty
wanderd
and
irregular
find
pardon
on
my
true
submission
god
pardon
thee
yet
let
me
wonder
harry
at
thy
affections
which
do
hold
a
wing
quite
from
the
flight
of
all
thy
ancestors
thy
place
in
council
thou
hast
rudely
lost
which
by
thy
younger
brother
is
supplied
and
art
almost
an
alien
to
the
hearts
of
all
the
court
and
princes
of
my
blood
the
hope
and
expectation
of
thy
time
is
ruind
and
the
soul
of
every
man
prophetically
do
forethink
thy
fall
had
i
so
lavish
of
my
presence
been
so
commonhackneyd
in
the
eyes
of
men
so
stale
and
cheap
to
vulgar
company
opinion
that
did
help
me
to
the
crown
had
still
kept
loyal
to
possession
and
left
me
in
reputeless
banishment
a
fellow
of
no
mark
nor
likelihood
by
being
seldom
seen
i
could
not
stir
but
like
a
comet
i
was
wonderd
at
that
men
would
tell
their
children
this
is
he
others
would
say
where
which
is
bolingbroke
and
then
i
stole
all
courtesy
from
heaven
and
dressd
myself
in
such
humility
that
i
did
pluck
allegiance
from
mens
hearts
loud
shouts
and
salutations
from
their
mouths
even
in
the
presence
of
the
crowned
king
thus
did
i
keep
my
person
fresh
and
new
my
presence
like
a
robe
pontifical
neer
seen
but
wonderd
at
and
so
my
state
seldom
but
sumptuous
showed
like
a
feast
and
won
by
rareness
such
solemnity
the
skipping
king
he
ambled
up
and
down
with
shallow
jesters
and
rash
bavin
wits
soon
kindled
and
soon
burnt
carded
his
state
mingled
his
royalty
with
capering
fools
had
his
great
name
profaned
with
their
scorns
and
gave
his
countenance
against
his
name
to
laugh
at
gibing
boys
and
stand
the
push
of
every
beardless
vain
comparative
grew
a
companion
to
the
common
streets
enfeoffd
himself
to
popularity
that
being
daily
swallowd
by
mens
eyes
they
surfeited
with
honey
and
began
to
loathe
the
taste
of
sweetness
whereof
a
little
more
than
a
little
is
by
much
too
much
so
when
he
had
occasion
to
be
seen
he
was
but
as
the
cuckoo
is
in
june
heard
not
regarded
seen
but
with
such
eyes
as
sick
and
blunted
with
community
afford
no
extraordinary
gaze
such
as
is
bent
on
sunlike
majesty
when
it
shines
seldom
in
admiring
eyes
but
rather
drowsd
and
hung
their
eyelids
down
slept
in
his
face
and
renderd
such
aspect
as
cloudy
men
use
to
their
adversaries
being
with
his
presence
glutted
gorgd
and
full
and
in
that
very
line
harry
standst
thou
for
thou
hast
lost
thy
princely
privilege
with
vile
participation
not
an
eye
but
is
aweary
of
thy
common
sight
save
mine
which
hath
desird
to
see
thee
more
which
now
doth
that
i
would
not
have
it
do
make
blind
itself
with
foolish
tenderness
i
shall
hereafter
my
thrice
gracious
lord
be
more
myself
for
all
the
world
as
thou
art
to
this
hour
was
richard
then
when
i
from
france
set
foot
at
ravenspurgh
and
even
as
i
was
then
is
percy
now
now
by
my
sceptre
and
my
soul
to
boot
he
hath
more
worthy
interest
to
the
state
than
thou
the
shadow
of
succession
for
of
no
right
nor
colour
like
to
right
he
doth
fill
fields
with
harness
in
the
realm
turns
head
against
the
lions
armed
jaws
and
being
no
more
in
debt
to
years
than
thou
leads
ancient
lords
and
reverend
bishops
on
to
bloody
battles
and
to
bruising
arms
what
neverdying
honour
hath
he
got
against
renowned

defiance

my
noble
scot
if
speaking
truth
in
this
fine
age
were
not
thought
flattery
such
attribution
should
the
douglas
have
as
not
a
soldier
of
this
seasons
stamp
should
go
so
general
current
through
the
world
by
god
i
cannot
flatter
do
defy
the
tongues
of
soothers
but
a
braver
place
in
my
hearts
love
hath
no
man
than
yourself
nay
task
me
to
my
word
approve
me
lord
thou
art
the
king
of
honour
no
man
so
potent
breathes
upon
the
ground
but
i
will
beard
him
do
so
and
tis
well
what
letters
hast
thou
there
i
can
but
thank
you
these
letters
come
from
your
father
letters
from
him
why
comes
he
not
himself
he
cannot
come
my
lord
hes
grievous
sick
zounds
how
has
he
the
leisure
to
be
sick
in
such
a
justling
time
who
leads
his
power
under
whose
government
come
they
along
his
letters
bear
his
mind
not
i
my
lord
i
prithee
tell
me
doth
he
keep
his
bed
he
did
my
lord
four
days
ere
i
set
forth
and
at
the
time
of
my
departure
thence
he
was
much
feard
by
his
physicians
i
would
the
state
of
time
had
first
been
whole
ere
he
by
sickness
had
been
visited
his
health
was
never
better
worth
than
now
sick
now
droop
now
this
sickness
doth
infect
the
very
lifeblood
of
our
enterprise
tis
catching
hither
even
to
our
camp
he
writes
me
here
that
inward
sickness
and
that
his
friends
by
deputation
could
not
so
soon
be
drawn
nor
did
he
think
it
meet
to
lay
so
dangerous
and
dear
a
trust
on
any
soul
removd
but
on
his
own
yet
doth
he
give
us
bold
advertisement
that
with
our
small
conjunction
we
should
on
to
see
how
fortune
is
disposd
to
us
for
as
he
writes
there
is
no
quailing
now
because
the
king
is
certainly
possessd
of
all
our
purposes
what
say
you
to
it
your
fathers
sickness
is
a
maim
to
us
a
perilous
gash
a
very
limb
loppd
off
and
yet
in
faith
tis
not
his
present
want
seems
more
than
we
shall
find
it
were
it
good
to
set
the
exact
wealth
of
all
our
states
all
at
one
cast
to
set
so
rich
a
main
on
the
nice
hazard
of
one
doubtful
hour
it
were
not
good
for
therein
should
we
read
the
very
bottom
and
the
soul
of
hope
the
very
list
the
very
utmost
bound
of
all
our
fortunes
faith
and
so
we
should
where
now
remains
a
sweet
reversion
we
may
boldly
spend
upon
the
hope
of
what
is
to
come
in
a
comfort
of
retirement
lives
in
this
a
rendezvous
a
home
to
fly
unto
if
that
the
devil
and
mischance
look
big
upon
the
maidenhead
of
our
affairs
but
yet
i
would
your
father
had
been
here
the
quality
and
hair
of
our
attempt
brooks
no
division
it
will
be
thought
by
some
that
know
not
why
he
is
away
that
wisdom
loyalty
and
mere
dislike
of
our
proceedings
kept
the
earl
from
hence
and
think
how
such
an
apprehension
may
turn
the
tide
of
fearful
faction
and
breed
a
kind
of
question
in
our
cause
for
well
you
know
we
of
the
offering
side
must
keep
aloof
from
strict
arbitrement
and
stop
all
sightholes
every
loop
from
whence
the
eye
of
reason
may
pry
in
upon
us
this
absence
of
your
fathers
draws
a
curtain
that
shows
the
ignorant
a
kind
of
fear
before
not
dreamt
of
you
strain
too
far
i
rather
of
his
absence
make
this
use
it
lends
a
lustre
and
more
great
opinion
a
larger
dare
to
our
great
enterprise
than
if
the
earl
were
here
for
men
must
think
if
we
without
his
help
can
make
a
head
to
push
against
the
kingdom
with
his
help
we
shall
oerturn
it
topsyturvy
down
yet
all
goes
well
yet
all
our
joints
are
whole
as
heart
can
think
there
is
not
such
a
word
spoke
of
in
scotland
as
this
term
of
fear

good
householders
yeomens
sons
inquire

out
contracted
bachelors
such
as
had
been
asked
twice
on
the
banns
such
a
commodity
of
warm
slaves
as

lief
hear
the

none
but
such
toastsandbutter
with
hearts
in
their
bellies
no
bigger
than
pins
heads
and
they

bought
out
their
services
and
now
my
whole
charge
consists
of
ancients
corporals
lieutenants
gentlemen
of
companies
slaves
as
ragged
as
lazarus
in
the
painted
cloth
where
the
gluttons
dogs
licked
his
sores
and
such
as
indeed
were
never
soldiers
but
discarded
unjust
servingmen
younger
sons
to
younger
brothers
revolted
tapsters
and
ostlers
tradefallen
the
cankers
of
a
calm
world
and
a
long
peace
ten
times
more
dishonourable
ragged
than
an
old
faced
ancient
and
such
have
i
to
fill
up
the
rooms
of
them
that
have
bought
out
their
services
that
you
would
think
that
i
had
a
hundred
and
fifty
tattered
prodigals
lately
come
from
swinekeeping
from
eating
draff
and
husks
a
mad
fellow
met
me
on
the
way
and
told
me
i
had
unloaded
all
the
gibbets
and
pressed
the
dead
bodies
no
eye
hath
seen
such
scarecrows
ill
not
march
through
coventry
with
them
thats
flat
nay
and
the
villains
march
wide
betwixt
the
legs
as
if
they
had
gyves
on
for
indeed
i
had
the
most
of
them
out
of
prison
theres
but
a
shirt
and
a
half
in
all
my
company
and
the
half
shirt
is
two
napkins
tacked
together
and
thrown
over
the
shoulders
like
a
heralds
coat
without
sleeves
and
the
shirt
to
say
the
truth
stolen
from
my
host
at
saint
albans
or
the
rednose
innkeeper
of
daventry
but
thats
all
one
theyll
find
linen
enough
on
every
hedge
how
now
blown
jack
how
now
quilt
what
hal
how
now
mad
wag
what
a
devil
dost
thou
in
warwickshire
my
good
lord
of
westmoreland
i
cry
you
mercy
i
thought
your
honour
had
already
been
at
shrewsbury
faith
sir
john
tis
more
than
time
that
i
were
there
and
you
too
but
my
powers
are
there
already
the
king
i
can
tell
you
looks
for
us
all
we
must
away
all
night
tut
never
fear
me
i
am
as
vigilant
as
a
cat
to
steal
cream
i
think
to
steal
cream
indeed
for
thy
theft
hath
already
made
thee
butter
but
tell
me
jack
whose
fellows
are
these
that
come
after
mine
hal
mine
i
did
never
see
such
pitiful
rascals
tut
tut
good
enough
to
toss
food
for
powder
food
for
powder
theyll
fill
a
pit
as
well
as
better
tush
man
mortal
men
mortal
men
ay
but
sir
john
methinks
they
are
exceeding
poor
and
bare
too
beggarly
faith
for
their
poverty
i
know
not
where
they
had
that
and
for
their
bareness
i
am
sure
they
never
learned
that
of
me
no
ill
be
sworn
unless
you
call
three
fingers
on
the
ribs
bare
but
sirrah
make
haste
percy
is
already
in
the
field
what
is
the
king
encamped
he
is
sir
john
i
fear
we
shall
stay
too
long
well
to
the
latter
end
of
a
fray
and
the
beginning
of
a
feast
fits
a
dull
fighter
and
a
keen
guest
well
fight
with
him
tonight
it
may
not
be
you
give
him
then
advantage
not
a
whit
why
say
you
so
looks
he
not
for
supply
so
do
we
his
is
certain
ours
is
doubtful
good
cousin
be
advisd
stir
not
tonight
do
not
my
lord
you
do
not
counsel
well
you
speak
it
out
of
fear
and
cold
heart
do
me
no
slander
douglas
by
my
life
and
i
dare
well
maintain
it
with
my
life
if
wellrespected
honour
bid
me
on
i
hold
as
little
counsel
with
weak
fear
as
you
my
lord
or
any
scot
that
this
day
lives
let
it
be
seen
tomorrow
in
the
battle
which
of
us
fears
yea
or
tonight
content
tonight
say
i
come
come
it
may
not
be
i
wonder
much
being
men
of
such
great
leading
as
you
are
that
you
foresee
not
what
impediments
drag
back
our
expedition
certain
horse
of
my
cousin
vernons
are
not
yet
come
up
your
uncle
worcesters
horse
came
but
today
and
now
their
pride
and
mettle
is
asleep
their
courage
with
hard
labour
tame
and
dull
that
not
a
horse
is
half
the
half
of
himself
so
are
the
horses
of
the
enemy
in
general
journeybated
and
brought
low
the
better
part
of
ours
are
full
of
rest
the
number
of
the
king
exceedeth
ours
for
gods
sake
cousin
stay
till
all
come
in
i
come
with
gracious
offers
from
the
king
if
you
vouchsafe
me
hearing
and
respect
welcome
sir
walter
blunt
and
would
to
god
you
were
of
our
determination
some
of
us
love
you
well
and
even
those
some
envy
your
great
deservings
and
good
name
because
you
are
not
of
our
quality
but
stand
against
us
like
an
enemy
and
god
defend
but
still
i
should
stand
so
so
long
as
out
of
limit
and
true
rule
you
stand
against
anointed
majesty
but
to
my
charge
the
king
hath
sent
to
know
the
nature
of
your
griefs
and
whereupon
you
conjure
from
the
breast
of
civil
peace
such
bold
hostility
teaching
his
duteous
land
audacious
cruelty
if
that
the
king
have
any
way
your
good
deserts
forgot
which
he
confesseth
to
be
manifold
he
bids
you
name
your
griefs
and
with
all
speed
you
shall
have
your
desires
with
interest
and
pardon
absolute
for
yourself
and
these
herein
misled
by
your
suggestion
the
king
is
kind
and
well
we
know
the
king
knows
at
what
time
to
promise
when
to
pay
my
father
and
my
uncle
and
myself
did
give
him
that
same
royalty
he
wears
and
when
he
was
not
sixandtwenty
strong
sick
in
the
worlds
regard
wretched
and
low
a
poor
unminded
outlaw
sneaking
home
my
father
gave
him
welcome
to
the
shore
and
when
he
heard
him
swear
and
vow
to
god
he
came
but
to
be
duke
of
lancaster
to
sue
his
livery
and
beg
his
peace
with
tears
of
innocency
and
terms
of
zeal
my
father
in
kind
heart
and
pity
movd
swore
him
assistance
and
performd
it
too
now
when
the
lords
and
barons
of
the
realm
perceivd
northumberland
did
lean
to
him
the
more
and
less
came
in
with
cap
and
knee
met
him
in
boroughs
cities
villages
attended
him
on
bridges
stood
in
lanes
laid
gifts
before
him
profferd
him
their
oaths
gave
him
their
heirs
as
pages
followd
him
even
at
the
heels
in
golden
multitudes
he
presently
as
greatness
knows
itself
steps
me
a
little
higher
than
his
vow
made
to
my
father
while
his
blood
was
poor
upon
the
naked
shore
at
ravenspurgh
and
now
forsooth
takes
on
him
to
reform
some
certain
edicts
and
some
strait
decrees
that
lie
too
heavy
on
the
commonwealth
cries
out
upon
abuses
seems
to
weep
over
his
countrys
wrongs
and
by
this
face
this
seeming
brow
of
justice
did
he
win
the
hearts
of
all
that
he
did
angle
for
proceeded
further
cut
me
off
the
heads
of
all
the
favourites
that
the
absent
king
in
deputation
left
behind
him
here
when
he
was
personal
in
the
irish
war
tut
i
came
not
to
hear
this
then
to
the
point
in
short
time
after
he
deposd
the
king
soon
after
that
deprivd
him
of
his
life
and
in
the
neck
of
that
taskd
the
whole
state
to
make
that
worse
sufferd
his
kinsman
march
who
is
if
every
owner
were
well
placd
indeed
his
king
to
be
engagd
in
wales
there
without
ransom
to
lie
forfeited
disgracd
me
in
my
happy
victories
sought
to
entrap
me
by
intelligence
rated
my
uncle
from
the
councilboard
in
rage
dismissd
my
father
from
the
court
broke
oath
on
oath
committed
wrong
on
wrong
and
in
conclusion
drove
us
to
seek
out
this
head
of
safety
and
withal
to
pry
into
his
title
the
which
we
find
too
indirect
for
long
continuance
shall
i
return
this
answer
to
the
king
not
so
sir
walter
well
withdraw
awhile
go
to
the
king
and
let
there
be
impawnd
some
surety
for
a
safe
return
again
and
in
the
morning
early
shall
my
uncle
bring
him
our
purposes
and
so
farewell
i
would
you
would
accept
of
grace
and
love
and
may
be
so
we
shall
pray
god
you
do
hie
good
sir
michael
bear
this
sealed
brief
with
winged
haste
to
the
lord
marshal
this
to
my
cousin
scroop
and
all
the
rest
to
whom
they
are
directed
if
you
knew
how
much
they
do
import
you
would
make
haste
my
good
lord
i
guess
their
tenour
like
enough
you
do
tomorrow
good
sir
michael
is
a
day
wherein
the
fortune
of
ten
thousand
men
must
bide
the
touch
for
sir
at
shrewsbury
as
i
am
truly
given
to
understand
the
king
with
mighty
and
quickraised
power
meets
with
lord
harry
and
i
fear
sir
michael
what
with
the
sickness
of
northumberland
whose
power
was
in
the
first
proportion
and
what
with
owen
glendowers
absence
thence
who
with
them
was
a
rated
sinew
too
and
comes
not
in
oerruld
by
prophecies
i
fear
the
power
of
percy
is
too
weak
to
wage
an
instant
trial
with
the
king
why
my
good
lord
you
need
not
fear
there
is
the
douglas
and
lord
mortimer
no
mortimer
is
not
there
but
there
is
mordake
vernon
lord
harry
percy
and
theres
my
lord
of
worcester
and
a
head
of
gallant
warriors
noble
gentlemen
and
so
there
is
but
yet
the
king
hath
drawn
the
special
head
of
all
the
land
together
the
prince
of
wales
lord
john
of
lancaster
the
noble
westmoreland
and
warlike
blunt
and
many
moe
corrivals
and
dear
men
of
estimation
and
command
in
arms
doubt
not
my
lord
they
shall
be
well
opposd
i
hope
no
less
yet
needful
tis
to
fear
and
to
prevent
the
worse
sir
michael
speed
for
if
lord
percy
thrive
not
ere
the
king
dismiss
his
power
he
means
to
visit
us
for
he
hath
heard
of
our
confederacy
and
tis
but
wisdom
to
make
strong
against
him
therefore
make
haste
i
must
go
write
again
to
other
friends
and
so
farewell
sir
michael
how
bloodily
the
sun
begins
to
peer
above
yon
busky
hill
the
day
looks
pale
at
his
distemperature
the
southern
wind
doth
play
the
trumpet
to
his
purposes
and
by
his
hollow
whistling
in
the
leaves
foretells
a
tempest
and
a
blustering
day
then
with
the
losers
let
it
sympathize
for
nothing
can
seem
foul
to
those
that
win
how
now
my
lord
of
worcester
tis
not
well
that
you
and
i
should
meet
upon
such
terms
as
now
we
meet
you
have
deceivd
our
trust
and
made
us
doff
our
easy
robes
of
peace
to
crush
our
old
limbs
in
ungentle
steel
this
is
not
well
my
lord
this
is
not
well
what
say
you
to
it
will
you
again
unknit
this
churlish
knot
of
allabhorred
war
and
move
in
that
obedient
orb
again
where
you
did
give
a
fair
and
natural
light
and
be
no
more
an
exhald
meteor
a
prodigy
of
fear
and
a
portent
of
broached
mischief
to
the
unborn
times
hear
me
my
liege
for
mine
own
part
i
could
be
well
content
to
entertain
the
lagend
of
my
life
with
quiet
hours
for
i
do
protest
i
have
not
sought
the
day
of
this
dislike
you
have
not
sought
it
how
comes
it
then
rebellion
lay
in
his
way
and
he
found
it
peace
chewet
peace
it
pleasd
your
majesty
to
turn
your
looks
of
favour
from
myself
and
all
our
house
and
yet
i
must
remember
you
my
lord
we
were
the
first
and
dearest
of
your
friends
for
you
my
staff
of
office
did
i
break
in
richards
time
and
posted
day
and
night
to
meet
you
on
the
way
and
kiss
your
hand
when
yet
you
were
in
place
and
in
account
nothing
so
strong
and
fortunate
as
i
it
was
myself
my
brother
and
his
son
that
brought
you
home
and
boldly
did
outdare
the
dangers
of
the
time
you
swore
to
us
and
you
did
swear
that
oath
at
doncaster
that
you
did
nothing
purpose
gainst
the
state
nor
claim
no
further
than
your
newfalln
right
the
seat
of
gaunt
dukedom
of
lancaster
to
this
we
swore
our
aid
but
in
short
space
it
raind
down
fortune
showering
on
your
head
and
such
a
flood
of
greatness
fell
on
you
what
with
our
help
what
with
the
absent
king
what
with
the
injuries
of
a
wanton
time
the
seeming
sufferances
that
you
had
borne
and
the
contrarious
winds
that
held
the
king
so
long
in
his
unlucky
irish
wars
that
all
in
england
did
repute
him
dead
and
from
this
swarm
of
fair
advantages
you
took
occasion
to
be
quickly
wood
to
gripe
the
general
sway
into
your
hand
forgot
your
oath
to
us
at
doncaster
and
being
fed
by
us
you
usd
us
so
as
that
ungentle
gull
the
cuckoos
bird
useth
the
sparrow
did
oppress
our
nest
grew
by
our
feeding
to
so
great
a
bulk
that
even
our
love
durst
not
come
near
your
sight
for
fear
of
swallowing
but
with
nimble
wing
we
were
enforcd
for
safetys
sake
to
fly
out
of
your
sight
and
raise
this
present
head
whereby
we
stand
opposed
by
such
means
as
you
yourself
have
forgd
against
yourself
by
unkind
usage
dangerous
countenance
and
violation
of
all
faith
and
troth
sworn
to
us
in
your
younger
enterprise
these
things
indeed
you
have
articulate
proclaimd
at
marketcrosses
read
in
churches
to
face
the
garment
of
rebellion
with
some
fine
colour
that
may
please
the
eye
of
fickle
changelings
and
poor
discontents
which
gape
and
rub
the
elbow
at
the
news
of
hurlyburly
innovation
and
never
yet
did
insurrection
want
such
watercolours
to
impaint
his
cause
nor
moody
beggars
starving
for
a
time
of
pellmell
havoc
and
confusion
in
both
our
armies
there
is
many
a
soul
shall
pay
full
dearly
for
this
encounter
if
once
they
join
in
trial
tell
your
nephew
the
prince
of
wales
doth
join
with
all
the
world
in
praise
of
henry
percy
by
my
hopes
this
present
enterprise
set
off
his
head
i
do
not
think
a
braver
gentleman
more
activevaliant
or
more
valiantyoung
more
daring
or
more
bold
is
now
alive
to
grace
this
latter
age
with
noble
deeds
for
my
part
i
may
speak
it
to
my
shame
i
have
a
truant
been
to
chivalry
and
so
i
hear
he
doth
account
me
too
yet
this
before
my
fathers
majesty
i
am
content
that
he
shall
take
the
odds
of
his
great
name
and
estimation
and
will
to
save
the
blood
on
either
side
try
fortune
with
him
in
a
single
fight
and
prince
of
wales
so
dare
we
venture
thee
albeit
considerations
infinite
do
make
against
it
no
good
worcester
no
we
love
our
people
well
even
those
we
love
that
are
misled
upon
your
cousins
part
and
will
they
take
the
offer
of
our
grace
both
he
and
they
and
you
yea
every
man
shall
be
my
friend
again
and
ill
be
his
so
tell
your
cousin
and
bring
me
word
what
he
will
do
but
if
he
will
not
yield
rebuke
and
dread
correction
wait
on
us
and
they
shall
do
their
office
so
be
gone
we
will
not
now
be
troubled
with
reply
we
offer
fair
take
it
advisedly
it
will
not
be
accepted
on
my
life
the
douglas
and
the
hotspur
both
together
are
confident
against
the
world
in
arms
hence
therefore
every
leader
to
his
charge
for
on
their
answer
will
we
set
on
them
and
god
befriend
us
as
our
cause
is
just
hal
if
thou
see
me
down
in
the
battle
and
bestride
me
so
tis
a
point
of
friendship
nothing
but
a
colossus
can
do
thee
that
friendship
say
thy
prayers
and
farewell
i
would
it
were
bedtime
hal
and
all
well
why
thou
owest
god
a
death
tis
not
due
yet
i
would
be
loath
to
pay
him
before
his
day
what
need
i
be
so
forward
with
him
that
calls
not
on
me
well
tis
no
matter
honour
pricks
me
on
yea
but
how
if
honour
prick
me
off
when
i
come
on
how
then
can
honour
set
to
a
leg
no
or
an
arm
no
or
take
away
the
grief
of
a
wound
no
honour
hath
no
skill
in
surgery
then
no
what
is
honour
a
word
what
is
that
word
honour
air
a
trim
reckoning
who
hath
it
he
that
died
o
wednesday
doth
he
feel
it
no
doth
he
hear
it
no
it
is
insensible
then
yea
to
the
dead
but
will
it
not
live
with
the
living
no
why
detraction
will
not
suffer
it
therefore
ill
none
of
it
honour
is
a
mere
scutcheon
and
so
ends
my
catechism
o
no
my
nephew
must
not
know
sir
richard
the
liberal
kind
offer
of
the
king
twere
best
he
did
then
are
we
all
undone
it
is
not
possible
it
cannot
be
the
king
should
keep
his
word
in
loving
us
he
will
suspect
us
still
and
find
a
time
to
punish
this
offence
in
other
faults
suspicion
all
our
lives
shall
be
stuck
full
of
eyes
for
treason
is
but
trusted
like
the
fox
who
neer
so
tame
so
cherishd
and
lockd
up
will
have
a
wild
trick
of
his
ancestors
look
how
we
can
or
sad
or
merrily
interpretation
will
misquote
our
looks
and
we
shall
feed
like
oxen
at
a
stall
the
better
cherishd
still
the
nearer
death
my
nephews
trespass
may
be
well
forgot
it
hath
the
excuse
of
youth
and
heat
of
blood
and
an
adopted
name
of
privilege
a
harebraind
hotspur
governd
by
a
spleen
all
his
offences
live
upon
my
head
and
on
his
fathers
we
did
train
him
on
and
his
corruption
being
taen
from
us
we
as
the
spring
of
all
shall
pay
for
all
therefore
good
cousin
let
not
harry
know
in
any
case
the
offer
of
the
king
deliver
what
you
will
ill
say
tis
so
here
comes
your
cousin
my
uncle
is
returnd

up
my
lord
of
westmoreland
uncle
what
news

defy
him
by
the
lord
of
westmoreland
lord
douglas
go
you
and
tell
him
so
marry
and
shall
and
very
willingly
there
is
no
seeming
mercy
in
the
king
did
you
beg
any
god
forbid
i
told
him
gently
of
our
grievances
of
his
oathbreaking
which
he
mended
thus
by
now
forswearing
that
he
is
forsworn
he
calls
us
rebels
traitors
and
will
scourge
with
haughty
arms
this
hateful
name
in
us
arm
gentlemen
to
arms
for
i
have
thrown
a
brave
defiance
in
king
henrys
teeth
and
westmoreland
that
was
engagd
did
bear
it
which
cannot
choose
but
bring
him
quickly
on
the
prince
of
wales
steppd
forth
before
the
king
and
nephew
challengd
you
to
single
fight
o
would
the
quarrel
lay
upon
our
heads
and
that
no
man
might
draw
short
breath
today
but
i
and
harry
monmouth
tell
me
tell
me
how
showd
his
tasking
seemd
it
in
contempt
no
by
my
soul
i
never
in
my
life
did
hear
a
challenge
urgd
more
modestly
unless
a
brother
should
a
brother
dare
to
gentle
exercise
and
proof
of
arms
he
gave
you
all
the
duties
of
a
man
trimmd
up
your
praises
with
a
princely
tongue
spoke
your
deservings
like
a
chronicle
making
you
ever
better
than
his
praise
by
still
dispraising
praise
valud
with
you
and
which
became
him
like
a
prince
indeed
he
made
a
blushing
cital
of
himself
and
chid
his
truant
youth
with
such
a
grace
as
if
he
masterd
there
a
double
spirit
of
teaching
and
of
learning
instantly
there
did
he
pause
but
let
me
tell
the
world
if
he
outlive
the
envy
of
this
day
england
did
never
owe
so
sweet
a
hope
so
much
misconstrud
in
his
wantonness
cousin
i
think
thou
art
enamoured
on
his
follies
never
did
i
hear
of
any
prince
so
wild
a
libertine
but
be
he
as
he
will
yet
once
ere
night
i
will
embrace
him
with
a
soldiers
arm
that
he
shall
shrink
under
my
courtesy
arm
arm
with
speed
and
fellows
soldiers

consider
what
you
have
to
do
than

gift
of
tongue

lift
your
blood
up
with
persuasion

still
ending
at
the
arrival
of
an
hour

do
his
best
and
here

to
stain

i
can
meet
withal
in
the
adventure
of
this
perilous
day

seek
upon
my
head

then
my
name

thee

the
prince
of
wales
from
such
a
field
as
this
where
staind
nobility
lies
trodden
on
and
rebels
arms
triumph
in
massacres
we
breathe
too
long
come
cousin
westmoreland
our
duty
this
way
lies
for
gods
sake
come
by
god
thou
hast
deceivd
me
lancaster
i
did
not
think
thee
lord
of
such
a
spirit
before
i
lovd
thee
as
a
brother
john
but
now
i
do
respect
thee
as
my
soul
i
saw
him
hold
lord
percy
at
the
point
with
lustier
maintenance
than
i
did
look
for
of
such
an
ungrown
warrior
o
this
boy
lends
mettle
to
us
all
another
king
they
grow
like
hydras
heads
i
am
the
douglas
fatal
to
all
those
that
wear
those
colours
on
them
what
art
thou
that
counterfeitst
the
person
of
a
king
the
king
himself
who
douglas
grieves
at
heart
so
many
of
his
shadows
thou
hast
met
and
not
the
very
king
i
have
two
boys
seek
percy
and
thyself
about
the
field
but
seeing
thou
fallst
on
me
so
luckily
i
will
assay
thee
so
defend
thyself
i
fear
thou
art
another
counterfeit
and
yet
in
faith
thou
bearst
thee
like
a
king
but
mine
i
am
sure
thou
art
whoeer
thou
be
and
thus
i
win
thee
hold
up
thy
head
vile
scot
or
thou
art
like
never
to
hold
it
up
again
the
spirits
of
valiant
shirley
stafford
blunt
are
in
my
arms
it
is
the
prince
of
wales
that
threatens
thee
who
never
promiseth
but
he
means
to
pay
cheerly
my
lord
how
fares
your
grace
sir
nicholas
gawsey
hath
for
succour
sent
and
so
hath
clifton
ill
to
clifton
straight
stay
and
breathe
awhile
thou
hast
redeemd
thy
lost
opinion
and
showd
thou
makst
some
tender
of
my
life
in
this
fair
rescue
thou
hast
brought
to
me
o
god
they
did
me
too
much
injury
that
ever
said
i
hearkend
for
your
death
if
it
were
so
i
might
have
let
alone
the
insulting
hand
of
douglas
over
you
which
would
have
been
as
speedy
in
your
end
as
all
the
poisonous
potions
in
the
world
and
savd
the
treacherous
labour
of
your
son
make
up
to
clifton
ill
to
sir
nicholas
gawsey
if
i
mistake
not
thou
art
harry
monmouth
thou
speakst
as
if
i
would
deny
my
name
my
name
is
harry
percy
why
then
i
see
a
very
valiant
rebel
of
that
name
i
am
the
prince
of
wales
and
think
not
percy
to
share
with
me
in
glory
any
more
two
stars
keep
not
their
motion
in
one
sphere
nor
can
one
england
brook
a
double
reign
of
harry
percy
and
the
prince
of
wales
nor
shall
it
harry
for
the
hour
is
come
to
end
the
one
of
us
and
would
to
god
thy
name
in
arms
were
now
as
great
as
mine
ill
make
it
greater
ere
i
part
from
thee
and
all
the
budding
honours
on
thy
crest
ill
crop
to
make
a
garland
for
my
head
i
can
no
longer
brook
thy
vanities
well
said
hal
to
it
hal
nay
you
shall
find
no
boys
play
here
i
can
tell
you
o
harry
thou
hast
robbd
me
of
my
youth
i
better
brook
the
loss
of
brittle
life
than
those
proud
titles
thou
hast
won
of
me
they
wound
my
thoughts
worse
than
thy
sword
my
flesh
but
thoughts
the
slave
of
life
and
life
times
fool
and
time
that
takes
survey
of
all
the
world
must
have
a
stop
o
i
could
prophesy
but
that
the
earthy
and
cold
hand
of
death
lies
on
my
tongue
no
percy
thou
art
dust
and
food
for
for
worms
brave
percy
fare
thee
well
great
heart
illweavd
ambition
how
much
art
thou
shrunk
when
that
this
body
did
contain
a
spirit
a
kingdom
for
it
was
too
small
a
bound
but
now
two
paces
of
the
vilest
earth
is
room
enough
this
earth
that
bears
thee
dead
bears
not
alive
so
stout
a
gentleman
if
thou
wert
sensible
of
courtesy
i
should
not
make
so
dear
a
show
of
zeal
but
let
my
favours
hide
thy
mangled
face
and
even
in
thy
behalf
ill
thank
myself
for
doing
these
fair
rites
of
tenderness
adieu
and
take
thy
praise
with
thee
to
heaven
thy
ignomy
sleep
with
thee
in
the
grave
but
not
rememberd
in
thy
epitaph
what
old
acquaintance
could
not
all
this
flesh
keep
in
a
little
life
poor
jack
farewell
i
could
have
better
spard
a
better
man
o
i
should
have
a
heavy
miss
of
thee
if
i
were
much
in
love
with
vanity
death
hath
not
struck
so
fat
a
deer
today
though
many
dearer
in
this
bloody
fray
embowelld
will
i
see
thee
by
and
by
till
then
in
blood
by
noble
percy
lie
embowelled
if
thou
embowel
me
today
ill
give
you
leave
to
powder
me
and
eat
me
too
tomorrow
sblood
twas
time
to
counterfeit
or
that
hot
termagant
scot
had
paid
me
scot
and
lot
too
counterfeit
i
lie
i
am
no
counterfeit
to
die
is
to
be
a
counterfeit
for
he
is
but
the
counterfeit
of
a
man
who
hath
not
the
life
of
a
man
but
to
counterfeit
dying
when
a
man
thereby
liveth
is
to
be
no
counterfeit
but
the
true
and
perfect
image
of
life
indeed
the
better
part
of
valour
is
discretion
in
the
which
better
part
i
have
saved
my
life
zounds
i
am
afraid
of
this
gunpowder
percy
though
he
be
dead
how
if
he
should
counterfeit
too
and
rise
by
my
faith
i
am
afraid
he
would
prove
the
better
counterfeit
therefore
ill
make
him
sure
yea
and
ill
swear
i
killed
him
why
may
not
he
rise
as
well
as
i
nothing
confutes
me
but
eyes
and
nobody
sees
me
therefore
sirrah
stabbing
him
with
a
new
wound
in
your
thigh
come
you
along
with
me
come
brother
john
full
bravely
hast
thou
fleshd
thy
maiden
sword
but

this
fat
man

dead
i
did
i
saw
him
dead

the
ground
art
thou
alive
or

it
fantasy
that
plays
upon
our
eyesight
i
prithee
speak
we
will
not
trust
our
eyes
without
our
ears
thou
art
not
what
thou
seemst

assure
you
why

i
killed
myself
and
saw
thee
dead

thou

this
world
is
given
to
lying

grant
you
i
was
down
and
out
of
breath
and
so
was
he
but
we
rose
both
at
an
instant
and
fought
a
long
hour
by
shrewsbury
clock
if
i
may
be
believed
so
if
not
let
them
that
should
reward
valour
bear
the
sin
upon
their
own
heads
ill
take
it
upon
my
death
i
gave
him
this
wound
in
the
thigh
if
the
man
were
alive
and
would
deny
it
zounds
i
would
make
him
eat
a
piece
of
my
sword

is
the
strangest
tale
that
eer
i
heard
this
is
the
strangest
fellow

rebuke
illspirited
worcester
did
we
not
send
grace
pardon
and
terms
of
love
to
all
of
you
and
wouldst
thou
turn
our
offers
contrary
misuse
the
tenour
of
thy
kinsmans
trust
three
knights
upon
our
party
slain
today
a
noble
earl
and
many
a
creature
else
had
been
alive
this
hour
if
like
a
christian
thou
hadst
truly
borne
betwixt
our
armies
true
intelligence
what
i
have
done

urgd
me
to
and
i
embrace
this
fortune
patiently
since
not
to
be
avoided
it
falls
on
me
bear
worcester
to
the
death
and
vernon
too
other
offenders
we
will
pause
upon
how
goes

field
the
noble
scot
lord
douglas
when
he
saw
the
fortune
of
the
day
quite
turnd
from
him
the
noble
percy
slain
and
all
his
men
upon
the
foot
of
fear
fled
with
the
rest
and
falling
from
a
hill
he
was
so
bruisd
that
the
pursuers
took
him
at
my
tent
the
douglas
is
and
i
beseech
your
grace
i
may
dispose
of
him
with
all
my
heart
then

honourable
bounty

belong

to
the
douglas
and
deliver
him
up
to
his
pleasure
ransomless
and
free
his
valour
shown
upon
our
crests
today
hath
taught
us
how
to
cherish
such
high
deeds
even
in
the
bosom
of
our
adversaries
i
thank
your
grace
for
this
high
courtesy
which
i
shall
give

bend
you
with
your

another

before
his
archers
instead
whereof
sharp
stakes
pluckd
out

they
pitched
in
the
ground
confusedly
to
keep
the
horsemen
off
from

than
three
hours
the
fight
continued
where
valiant
talbot

thought
enacted
wonders
with

flinty
bulwarks
ascend
brave
talbot
we
will
follow
thee
not
all
together
better
far
i
guess
that
we
do
make
our
entrance
several
ways
that
if
it
chance
the
one
of
us
do
fail
the
other
yet
may
rise
against
their
force
agreed
ill
to
yond
corner
and
i
to
this
and
here
will
talbot
mount
or
make
his
grave
now
salisbury
for
thee
and
for
the
right
of
english
henry
shall
this
night
appear
how
much
in
duty
i
am
bound
to
both
arm
arm
the
enemy
doth
make
assault
how
now
my
lords
what
all
unready
so
unready
ay
and
glad
we
scapd
so
well
twas
time
i
trow
to
wake
and
leave
our
beds
hearing
alarums
at
our
chamberdoors
of
all
exploits
since
first
i
followd
arms
neer
heard
i
of
a
warlike
enterprise
more
venturous
or
desperate
than
this
i
think
this
talbot
be
a
fiend
of
hell
if
not
of
hell
the
heavens
sure
favour
him
here
cometh
charles
i
marvel
how
he
sped
tut
holy
joan
was
his
defensive
guard
is
this
thy
cunning
thou
deceitful
dame
didst
thou
at
first
to
flatter
us
withal
make
us
partakers
of
a
little
gain
that
now
our
loss
might
be
ten
times
so
much
wherefore
is
charles
impatient
with
his
friend
at
all
times
will
you
have
my
power
alike
sleeping
or
waking
must
i
still
prevail
or
will
you
blame
and
lay
the
fault
on
me
improvident
soldiers
had
your
watch
been
good
this
sudden
mischief
never
could
have
falln
duke
of
alen
on
this
was
your
default
that
being
captain
of
the
watch
tonight
did
look
no
better
to
that
weighty
charge
had
all
your
quarters
been
so
safely
kept
as
that
whereof
i
had
the
government
we
had
not
been
thus
shamefully
surprisd
mine
was
secure
and
so
was
mine
my
lord
and
for
myself
most
part
of
all
this
night
within
her
quarter
and
mine
own
precinct
i
was
employd
in
passing
to
and
fro
about
relieving
of
the
sentinels
then
how
or
which
way
should
they
first
break
in
question
my
lords
no
further
of
the
case
how
or
which
way
tis
sure
they
found
some
place
but
weakly
guarded
where
the
breach
was
made
and
now
there
rests
no
other
shift
but
this
to
gather
our
soldiers
scatterd
and
dispersd
and
lay
new
platforms
to
endamage
them
ill
be
so
bold
to
take
what
they
have
left
the
cry
of
talbot
serves
me
for
a
sword
for
i
have
loaden
me
with
many
spoils
using
no
other
weapon
but
his
name
the
day
begins
to
break
and
night
is
fled
whose
pitchy
mantle
overveild
the
earth
here
sound
retreat
and
cease
our
hot
pursuit
bring
forth
the
body
of
old
salisbury
and
here
advance
it
in
the
marketplace
the
middle
centre
of
this
cursed
town
now
have
i
paid
my
vow
unto
his
soul
for
every
drop
of
blood
was
drawn
from
him
there
hath
at
least
five
frenchmen
died
tonight
and
that
hereafter
ages
may
behold
what
ruin
happend
in
revenge
of
him
within
their
chiefest
temple
ill
erect
a
tomb
wherein
his
corse
shall
be
interrd
upon
the
which
that
every
one
may
read
shall
be
engravd
the
sack
of
orleans
the
treacherous
manner
of
his
mournful
death
and
what
a
terror
he
had
been
to
france
but
lords
in
all
our
bloody
massacre
i
muse
we
met
not
with
the
dauphins
grace
his
newcome
champion
virtuous
joan
of
arc
nor
any
of
his
false
confederates
tis
thought
lord
talbot
when
the
fight
began
rousd
on
the
sudden
from
their
drowsy
beds
they
did
amongst
the
troops
of
armed
men
leap
oer
the
walls
for
refuge
in
the
field
myself
as
far
as
i
could
well
discern
for
smoke
and
dusky
vapours
of
the
night
am
sure
i
scard
the
dauphin
and
his
trull
when
arm
in
arm
they
both
came
swiftly
running
like
to
a
pair
of
loving
turtledoves
that
could
not
live
asunder
day
or
night
after
that
things
are
set
in
order
here
well
follow
them
with
all
the
power
we
have
all
hail
my
lords
which
of
this
princely
train
call
ye
the
warlike
talbot
for
his
acts
so
much
applauded
through
the
realm
of
france
here
is
the
talbot

would
speak

virtuous
lady

of
auvergne

modesty
admiring

renown

me
entreats

glory
fills
the
world
with
loud
report

it
even
so
nay
then
i
see

wars

peaceful
comic
sport

not
my
lord
despise
her
gentle
suit

censure

rare
reports

the
talbot
so
much
feard
abroad
that
with
his
name
the
mothers
still
their
babes
i
see
report
is
fabulous
and
false
i
thought
i
should
have
seen
some
hercules
a
second
hector
for
his
grim
aspect
and
large
proportion
of
his
strongknit
limbs
alas
this
is
a
child
a
silly
dwarf
it
cannot
be
this
weak
and
writhled
shrimp
should
strike
such
terror
to
his
enemies
madam
i
have
been
bold
to
trouble
you
but
since
your
ladyship
is
not
at
leisure
ill
sort
some
other
time
to
visit
you
what
means
he
now
go
ask
him
whither
he
goes
stay
my
lord
talbot
for
my
lady
craves
to
know
the
cause
of
your
abrupt
departure
marry
for
that
shes
in
a
wrong
belief
i
go
to
certify
her
talbots
here
if
thou
be
he
then
art
thou
prisoner
prisoner
to
whom
to
me
bloodthirsty
lord
and
for
that
cause
i
traind
thee
to
my
house
long
time
thy
shadow
hath
been
thrall
to
me
for
in
my
gallery
thy
picture
hangs
but
now
the
substance
shall
endure
the
like
and
i
will
chain
these
legs
and
arms
of
thine
that
hast
by
tyranny
these
many
years
wasted
our
country
slain
our
citizens
and
sent
our
sons
and
husbands
captivate
ha
ha
ha
laughest
thou
wretch
thy
mirth
shall
turn
to
moan
i
laugh
to
see
your
ladyship
so
fond
to
think
that
you
have
aught
but
talbots
shadow
whereon
to
practise
your
severity
why
art
not
thou
the
man
i
am
indeed
then
have
i
substance
too
no
no
i
am
but
shadow
of
myself
you
are
deceivd
my
substance
is
not
here
for
what
you
see
is
but
the
smallest
part
and
least
proportion
of
humanity
i
tell
you
madam
were
the
whole
frame
here
it
is
of
such
a
spacious
lofty
pitch
your
roof
were
not
sufficient
to
contain
it
this
is
a
riddling
merchant
for
the
nonce
he
will
be
here
and
yet
he
is
not
here
how
can
these
contrarieties
agree
that
will
i
show
you
presently
how
say
you
madam
are
you
now
persuaded
that
talbot
is
but
shadow
of
himself
these
are
his
substance
sinews
arms
and
strength
with
which
he
yoketh
your
rebellious
necks
razeth
your
cities
and
subverts
your
towns
and
in
a
moment
makes
them
desolate
victorious
talbot
pardon
my
abuse
i
find
thou
art
no
less
than
fame
hath
bruited
and
more
than
may
be
gatherd
by
thy
shape
let
my
presumption
not
provoke
thy
wrath
for
i
am
sorry
that
with
reverence
i
did
not
entertain
thee
as
thou
art
be
not
dismayd
fair
lady
nor
misconster
the
mind
of
talbot
as
you
did
mistake
the
outward
composition
of
his
body
what
you
have
done
hath
not
offended
me
nor
other
satisfaction
do
i
crave
but
only
with
your
patience
that
we
may
taste
of
your
wine
and
see
what
cates
you
have
for
soldiers
stomachs
always
serve
them
well
with
all
my
heart
and
think
me
honoured
to
feast
so
great
a
warrior
in
my
house
great
lords
and
gentlemen
what
means
this
silence
dare
no
man
answer
in
a
case
of
truth
within
the
temple
hall
we
were
too
loud
the
garden
here
is
more
convenient
then
say
at
once
if
i
maintaind
the
truth
or
else
was
wrangling
somerset
in
the
error
faith
i
have
been
a
truant
in
the
law
and
never
yet
could
frame
my
will
to
it
and
therefore
frame
the
law
unto
my
will
judge
you
my
lord
of
warwick
then
between
us
between
two
hawks
which
flies
the
higher
pitch
between
two
dogs
which
hath
the
deeper
mouth
between
two
blades
which
bears
the
better
temper
between
two
horses
which
doth
bear
him
best
between
two
girls
which
hath
the
merriest
eye
i
have
perhaps
some
shallow
spirit
of
judgment
but
in
these
nice
sharp
quillets
of
the
law
good
faith
i
am
no
wiser
than
a
daw
tut
tut
here
is
a
mannerly
forbearance
the
truth
appears
so
naked
on
my
side
that
any
purblind
eye
may
find
it
out
and
on
my
side
it
is
so
well
apparelld
so
clear
so
shining
and
so
evident
that
it
will
glimmer
through
a
blind
mans
eye
since
you
are
tonguetied
and
so
loath
to
speak
in
dumb
significants
proclaim
your
thoughts
let
him
that
is
a
trueborn
gentleman
and
stands
upon
the
honour
of
his
birth
if
he
suppose
that
i
have
pleaded
truth
from
off
this
brier
pluck
a
white
rose
with
me
let
him
that
is
no
coward
nor
no
flatterer
but
dare
maintain
the
party
of
the
truth
pluck
a
red
rose
from
off
this
thorn
with
me
i
love
no
colours
and
without
all
colour
of
base
insinuating
flattery
i
pluck
this
white
rose
with
plantagenet
i
pluck
this
red
rose
with
young
somerset
and
say
withal
i
think
he
held
the
right
stay
lords
and
gentlemen
and
pluck
no
more
till
you
conclude
that
he
upon
whose
side
the
fewest
roses
are
croppd
from
the
tree
shall
yield
the
other
in
the
right
opinion
good
master
vernon
it
is
well
objected
if
i
have
fewest
i
subscribe
in
silence
and
i
then
for
the
truth
and
plainness
of
the
case
i
pluck
this
pale
and
maiden
blossom
here
giving
my
verdict
on
the
white
rose
side
prick
not
your
finger
as
you
pluck
it
off
lest
bleeding
you
do
paint
the
white
rose
red
and
fall
on
my
side
so
against
your
will
if
i
my
lord
for
my
opinion
bleed
opinion
shall
be
surgeon
to
my
hurt
and
keep
me
on
the
side
where
still
i
am
well
well
come
on
who
else
unless
my
study
and
my
books
be
false
the
argument
you
held
was
wrong
in
you
in
sign
whereof
i
pluck
a
white
rose
too
now
somerset
where
is
your
argument
here
in
my
scabbard
meditating
that
shall
dye
your
white
rose
in
a
bloody
red
meantime
your
cheeks
do
counterfeit
our
roses
for
pale
they
look
with
fear
as
witnessing
the
truth
on
our
side
no
plantagenet
tis
not
for
fear
but
anger
that
thy
cheeks
blush
for
pure
shame
to
counterfeit
our
roses
and
yet
thy
tongue
will
not
confess
thy
error
hath
not
thy
rose
a
canker
somerset
hath
not
thy
rose
a
thorn
plantagenet
ay
sharp
and
piercing
to
maintain
his
truth
whiles
thy
consuming
canker
eats
his
falsehood
well
ill
find
friends
to
wear
my
bleeding
roses
that
shall
maintain
what
i
have
said
is
true
where
false
plantagenet
dare
not
be
seen
now
by
this
maiden
blossom
in
my
hand
i
scorn
thee
and
thy
faction
peevish
boy
turn
not
thy
scorns
this
way
plantagenet
proud
pole
i
will
and
scorn
both
him
and
thee
ill
turn
my
part
thereof
into
thy

i
thanks
gentle

four
to
dinner
i
dare
say
this
quarrel
will
drink
blood
another
day
kind
keepers
of
my
weak
decaying
age
let
dying
mortimer
here
rest
himself
even
like
a
man
new
haled
from
the
rack
so
fare
my
limbs
with
long
imprisonment
and
these
gray
locks
the
pursuivants
of
death
nestorlike
aged
in
an
age
of
care
argue
the
end
of
edmund
mortimer
these
eyes
like
lamps
whose
wasting
oil
is
spent
wax
dim
as
drawing
to
their
exigent
weak
shoulders
overborne
with
burdening
grief
and
pithless
arms
like
to
a
witherd
vine
that
droops
his
sapless
branches
to
the
ground
yet
are
these
feet
whose
strengthless
stay
is
numb
unable
to
support
this
lump
of
clay
swiftwinged
with
desire
to
get
a
grave
as
witting
i
no
other
comfort
have
but
tell
me
keeper
will
my
nephew
come
richard
plantagenet
my
lord
will
come
we
sent
unto
the
temple
unto
his
chamber
and
answer
was
returnd
that
he
will
come
enough
my
soul
shall
then
be
satisfied
poor
gentleman
his
wrong
doth
equal
mine
since
henry
monmouth
first
began
to
reign
before
whose
glory
i
was
great
in
arms
this
loathsome
sequestration
have
i
had
and
even
since
then
hath
richard
been
obscurd
deprivd
of
honour
and
inheritance
but
now
the
arbitrator
of
despairs
just
death
kind
umpire
of
mens
miseries
with
sweet
enlargement
doth
dismiss
me
hence
i
would
his
troubles
likewise
were
expird
that
so
he
might
recover
what
was
lost
my
lord
your
loving
nephew
now
is
come
richard
plantagenet
my
friend
is
he
come
ay
noble
uncle
thus
ignobly
usd
your
nephew
late
despised
richard
comes
direct
mine
arms
i
may
embrace
his
neck
and
in
his
bosom
spend
my
latter
gasp
o
tell
me
when
my
lips
do
touch
his
cheeks
that
i
may
kindly
give
one
fainting
kiss
and
now
declare
sweet
stem
from
yorks
great
stock
why
didst
thou
say
of
late
thou
wert
despisd
first
lean
thine
aged
back
against
mine
arm
and
in
that
ease
ill
tell
thee
my
disease
this
day
in
argument
upon
a
case
some
words
there
grew
twixt
somerset
and
me
among
which
terms
he
usd
a
lavish
tongue
and
did
upbraid
me
with
my
fathers
death
which
obloquy
set
bars
before
my
tongue
else
with
the
like
i
had
requited
him
therefore
good
uncle
for
my
fathers
sake
in
honour
of
a
true
plantagenet
and
for
alliance
sake
declare
the
cause
my
father
earl
of
cambridge
lost
his
head
that
cause
fair
nephew
that
imprisond
me
and
hath
detaind
me
all
my
flowring
youth
within
a
loathsome
dungeon
there
to
pine
was
cursed
instrument
of
his
decease
discover
more
at
large
what
cause
that
was
for
i
am
ignorant
and
cannot
guess
i
will
if
that
my
fading
breath
permit
and
death
approach
not
ere
my
tale
be
done
henry
the
fourth
grandfather
to
this
king
deposd
his
nephew
richard
edwards
son
the
firstbegotten
and
the
lawful
heir
of
edward
king
the
third
of
that
descent
during
whose
reign
the
percies
of
the
north
finding
his
usurpation
most
unjust
endeavourd
my
advancement
to
the
throne
the
reason
movd
these
warlike
lords
to
this
was
for
that
young
king
richard
thus
removd
leaving
no
heir
begotten
of
his
body
i
was
the
next
by
birth
and
parentage
for
by
my
mother
i
derived
am
from
lionel
duke
of
clarence
the
third
son
to
king
edward
the
third
whereas
he
from
john
of
gaunt
doth
bring
his
pedigree
being
but
fourth
of
that
heroic
line
but
mark
as
in
this
haughty
great
attempt
they
laboured
to
plant
the
rightful
heir
i
lost
my
liberty
and
they
their
lives
long
after
this
when
henry
the
fifth
succeeding
his
father
bolingbroke
did
reign
thy
father
earl
of
cambridge
then
derivd
from
famous
edmund
langley
duke
of
york
marrying
my
sister
that
thy
mother
was
again
in
pity
of
my
hard
distress
levied
an
army
weening
to
redeem
and
have
installd
me
in
the
diadem
but
as
the
rest
so
fell
that
noble
earl
and
was
beheaded
thus
the
mortimers
in
whom
the
title
rested
were
suppressd
of
which
my
lord
your
honour
is
the
last
true
and
thou
seest
that
i
no
issue
have
and
that
my
fainting
words
do
warrant
death
thou
art
my
heir
the
rest
i
wish
thee
gather
but
yet
be
wary
in
thy
studious
care
thy
grave
admonishments
prevail
with
me
but
yet
methinks
my
fathers
execution
was
nothing
less
than
bloody
tyranny
with
silence
nephew
be
thou
politic
strongfixed
is
the
house
of
lancaster
and
like
a
mountain
not
to
be
removd
but
now
thy
uncle
is
removing
hence
as
princes
do
their
courts
when
they
are
cloyd
with
long
continuance
in
a
settled
place
o
uncle
would
some
part
of
my
young
years
might
but
redeem
the
passage
of
your
age
thou
dost
then
wrong
me
as
the
slaughterer
doth
which
giveth
many
wounds
when
one
will
kill
mourn
not
except
thou
sorrow
for
my
good
only
give
order
for
my
funeral
and
so
farewell
and
fair
be
all
thy
hopes
and
prosperous
be
thy
life
in
peace
and
war
and
peace
no
war
befall
thy
parting
soul
in
prison
hast
thou
spent
a
pilgrimage
and
like
a
hermit
overpassd
thy
days
well
i
will
lock
his
counsel
in
my
breast
and
what
i
do
imagine
let
that
rest
keepers
convey
him
hence
and
i
myself
will
see
his
burial
better
than
his
life
here
dies
the
dusky
torch
of
mortimer
chokd
with
ambition
of
the
meaner
sort
and
for
those
wrongs
those
bitter
injuries
which
somerset
hath
offerd
to
my
house
i
doubt
not
but
with
honour
to
redress
and
therefore
haste
i
to
the
parliament
either
to
be
restored
to
my
blood
or
make
my
ill

the
manner
of
thy
vile
outrageous
crimes
that
therefore
i
have
forgd
or
am
not
able
verbatim
to
rehearse
the
method
of
my
pen
no
prelate
such
is
thy
audacious
wickedness
thy
lewd
pestiferous
and
dissentious
pranks
as
very
infants
prattle
of
thy
pride
thou
art
a
most
pernicious
usurer
froward
by
nature
enemy
to
peace
lascivious
wanton
more
than
well
beseems
a
man
of
thy
profession
and
degree
and
for
thy
treachery
whats
more
manifest
in
that
thou
laidst
a
trap
to
take
my
life
as
well
at
london
bridge
as
at
the
tower
beside
i
fear
me
if
thy
thoughts
were
sifted
the
king
thy
sovreign
is
not
quite
exempt
from
envious
malice
of
thy
swelling
heart
gloucester
i
do
defy
thee
lords
vouchsafe
to
give
me
hearing
what
i
shall
reply
if
i
were
covetous
ambitious
or
perverse
as
he
will
have
me
how
am
i
so
poor
or
how
haps
it
i
seek
not
to
advance
or
raise
myself
but
keep
my
wonted
calling
and
for
dissension
who
preferreth
peace
more
than
i
do
except
i
be
provokd
no
my
good
lords
it
is
not
that
offends
it
is
not
that
that
hath
incensd
the
duke
it
is
because
no
one
should
sway
but
he
no
one
but
he
should
be
about
the
king
and
that
engenders
thunder
in
his
breast
and
makes
him
roar
these
accusations
forth
but
he
shall
know
i
am
as
good
as
good
thou
bastard
of
my
grandfather
ay
lordly
sir
for
what
are
you
i
pray
but
one
imperious
in
anothers
throne
am
i
not
protector
saucy
priest
and
am
not
i
a
prelate
of
the
church
yes
as
an
outlaw
in
a
castle
keeps
and
useth
it
to
patronage
his
theft
unreverent
gloucester
thou
art
reverent
touching
thy
spiritual
function
not
thy

rome
shall
remedy
this
roam
thither
then
my
lord
it
were
your
duty
to
forbear
ay
see
the
bishop
be
not
overborne
methinks
my
lord
should
be
religious
and
know
the
office
that
belongs
to
such
methinks
his
lordship
should
be
humbler
it
fitteth
not
a
prelate
so
to
plead
yes
when
his
holy
state
is
touchd
so
near
state
holy
or
unhallowd
what
of
that
is
not
his

protector
to
the

plantagenet
i
see
must
hold
his
tongue
lest
it
be
said
speak
sirrah
when
you
should
must
your
bold
verdict
enter
talk
with
lords
else
would
i
have
a
fling
at
winchester
uncles
of
gloucester
and
of

the
special
watchmen
of

o
what
a
scandal
is
it
to
our
crown
that
two
such
noble
peers
as

a
viperous
worm

peace
if
holy
churchmen
take
delight

submit
or
i
will
never

behold
my
lord

the
duke
hath
banishd
moody
discontented
fury

tragical
here
winchester
i
offer
thee
my
hand
fie
uncle
beaufort
i
have
heard
you
preach
that
malice
was
a
great
and
grievous
sin
and

you
maintain
the
thing
you
teach
but
prove
a
chief
offender
in
the

but
i
fear
me
with
a
hollow
heart
see
here
my
friends

this
token
serveth
for
a
flag
of
truce
betwixt

and
all
our
followers
so

as
i
dissemble
not
so
help

how
joyful

i
made

contract
away
my
masters
trouble
us
no
more
but
join
in

as
your

and
so
will
i
and
i
will
see
what
physic
the
tavern
affords
accept
this
scroll
most
gracious
sovereign
which
in
the
right
of
richard
plantagenet
we
do
exhibit
to
your
majesty
well
urgd
my
lord
of
warwick
for
sweet
prince
an
if
your
grace
mark
every
circumstance
you
have
great
reason
to
do
richard
right
especially
for
those
occasions
at
elthamplace
i
told
your
majesty
and
those
occasions
uncle
were
of
force
therefore
my
loving
lords
our
pleasure
is
that
richard
be
restored
to
his
blood
let
richard
be
restored
to
his
blood
so
shall
his
fathers
wrongs
be
recompensd
as
will
the
rest
so
willeth
winchester
if
richard
will
be
true
not
that
alone
but
all
the
whole
inheritance
i
give
that
doth
belong
unto
the
house
of
york
from
whence
you
spring
by
lineal
descent
thy
humble
servant
vows
obedience
and
humble
service
till
the
point
of
death
stoop
then
and
set
your
knee
against
my
foot
and
in
reguerdon
of
that
duty
done
i
girt
thee
with
the
valiant
sword
of
york
rise
richard
like
a
true
plantagenet
and
rise
created
princely
duke
of
york
and
so
thrive
richard
as
thy
foes
may
fall
and
as
my
duty
springs
so
perish
they
that
grudge
one
thought
against
your
majesty
welcome
high
prince
the
mighty
duke
of
york
perish
base
prince
ignoble
duke
of
york
now
will
it
best
avail
your
majesty
to
cross
the
seas
and
to
be
crownd
in
france
the
presence
of
a
king
engenders
love
amongst
his
subjects
and
his
loyal
friends
as
it
disanimates
his
enemies
when
gloucester
says
the
word
king
henry
goes
for
friendly
counsel
cuts
off
many
foes
your
ships
already
are
in
readiness
ay
we
may
march
in
england
or
in
france
not
seeing
what
is
likely
to
ensue
this
late
dissension
grown
betwixt
the
peers
burns
under
feigned
ashes
of
forgd
love
and
will
at
last
break
out
into
a
flame
as
festerd
members
rot
but
by
degree
till
bones
and
flesh
and
sinews
fall
away
so
will
this
base
and
envious
discord
breed
and
now
i
fear
that
fatal
prophecy
which
in
the
time
of
henry
namd
the
fifth
was
in
the
mouth
of
every
sucking
babe
that
henry
born
at
monmouth
should
win
all
and
henry
born
at
windsor
should
lose
all
which
is
so
plain
that
exeter
doth
wish
his
days
may
finish
ere
that
hapless
time
these
are
the
city
gates
the
gates
of
roan
through
which
our
policy
must
make
a
breach
take
heed
be
wary
how
you
place
your
words
talk
like
the
vulgar
sort
of
marketmen
that
come
to
gather
money
for
their
corn
if
we
have
entrance
as
i
hope
we
shall
and
that
we
find
the
slothful
watch
but
weak
ill
by
a
sign
give
notice
to
our
friends
that
charles
the
dauphin
may
encounter
them
our
sacks
shall
be
a
mean
to
sack
the
city
and
we
be
lords
and
rulers
over
roan
therefore
well
knock
qui

and
once
again
well
sleep
secure
in
roan
here
enterd
pucelle
and
her
practisants
now
she
is
there
how
will
she
specify
where
is
the
best
and
safest
passage
in
by
thrusting
out
a
torch
from
yonder
tower
which
once
discernd
shows
that
her
meaning
is
no
way
to
that
for
weakness
which
she
enterd
behold
this
is
the
happy
wedding
torch
that
joineth
roan
unto
her
countrymen
but
burning
fatal
to
the
talbotites
see
noble
charles
the
beacon
of
our
friend
the
burning
torch
in
yonder
turret
stands
now
shine
it
like
a
comet
of

a
prophet
to
the
fall
of
all
our
foes
defer

make
thee
curse
the
harvest
of
that
corn
your

may
starve
perhaps
before

break

foul

a

by

to
tell

we
be
too
ere

be
long
or
else
reproach
be
talbots
greatest
fame
vow
burgundy
by
honour
of
thy
house
prickd
on
by
public
wrongs
sustaind
in
france
either
to
get
the
town
again
or
die
and
i
as
sure
as
english
henry
lives
and
as
his
father
here
was
conqueror
as
sure
as
in
this
latebetrayed
town
great
c
urdelions
heart
was
buried
so
sure
i
swear
to
get
the
town
or
die
my
vows
are
equal
partners
with
thy
vows
but
ere
we
go
regard
this
dying
prince
the
valiant
duke
of
bedford
come
my
lord
we
will
bestow
you
in
some
better
place
fitter
for
sickness
and
for
crazy
age
lord
talbot
do
not
so
dishonour
me
here
will
i
sit
before
the
walls
of
roan
and
will
be
partner
of
your
weal
or
woe
courageous
bedford
let
us
now
persuade
you
not
to
be
gone
from
hence
for
once
i
read
that
stout
pendragon
in
his
litter
sick
came
to
the
field
and
vanquished
his
foes
methinks
i
should
revive
the
soldiers
hearts
because
i
ever
found
them
as
myself
undaunted
spirit
in
a
dying
breast
then
be
it
so
heavens
keep
old
bedford
safe
and
now
no
more
ado
brave
burgundy
but
gather
we
our
forces
out
of
hand
and
set
upon
our
boasting
enemy
whither
away
sir
john
fastolfe
in
such
haste
whither
away
to
save
myself
by
flight
we
are
like
to
have
the
overthrow
again
what
will
you
fly
and
leave
lord
talbot
ay
all
the
talbots
in
the
world
to
save
my
life
cowardly
knight
ill
fortune
follow
thee
now
quiet
soul
depart
when
heaven
please
for
i
have
seen
our
enemies
overthrow
what
is
the
trust
or
strength
of
foolish
man
they
that
of
late
were
daring
with
their
scoffs
are
glad
and
fain
by
flight
to
save
themselves
lost
and
recoverd
in
a
day
again
this
is
a
double
honour
burgundy
yet
heavens
have
glory
for
this
victory
warlike
and
martial
talbot
burgundy
enshrines
thee
in
his
heart
and
there
erects
thy
noble
deeds
as
valours
monument
thanks
gentle
duke
but
where
is
pucelle
now
i
think
her
old
familiar
is
asleep
now
wheres
the
bastards
braves
and
charles
his
gleeks
what
all
amort
roan
hangs
her
head
for
grief
that
such
a
valiant
company
are
fled
now
will
we
take
some
order
in
the
town
placing
therein
some
expert
officers
and
then
depart
to
paris
to
the
king
for
there
young
henry
with
his
nobles
lie
what
wills
lord
talbot
pleaseth
burgundy
but
yet
before
we
go
lets
not
forget
the
noble
duke
of
bedford
late
deceasd
but
see
his
exequies
fulfilld
in
roan
a
braver
soldier
never
couched
lance
a
gentler
heart
did
never
sway
in
court
but
kings
and
mightiest
potentates
must
die
for
thats
the
end
of
human
misery
dismay
not
princes
at
this
accident
nor
grieve
that
roan
is
so
recovered
care
is
no
cure
but
rather
corrosive
for
things
that
are
not
to
be
remedied
let
frantic
talbot
triumph
for
a
while
and
like
a
peacock
sweep
along
his
tail
well
pull
his
plumes
and
take
away
his
train
if
dauphin
and
the
rest
will
be
but
ruld
we
have
been
guided
by
thee
hitherto
and
of
thy
cunning
had
no
diffidence
one
sudden
foil
shall
never
breed
distrust
search
out
thy
wit
for
secret
policies
and
we
will
make
thee
famous
through
the
world
well
set
thy
statue
in
some
holy
place
and
have
thee
reverencd
like
a
blessed
saint
employ
thee
then
sweet
virgin
for
our
good
then
thus
it
must
be
this
doth
joan
devise
by
fair
persuasions
mixd
with
sugard
words
we
will
entice
the
duke
of
burgundy
to
leave

if
we
could
do
that
france
were
no
place
for

nor
should
that
nation
boast
it
so
with
us
but
be
extirped
from

they
be
expulsd
from
france
and
not
have

here
your
honours
shall
perceive
how
i
will
work
to
bring
this
matter
to
the
wished
end
hark
by
the
sound
of
drum
you
may
perceive
their
powers
are
marching
unto
parisward
there
goes
the
talbot
with
his
colours
spread
and
all
the
troops
of
english
after
him
now
in
the
rearward
comes
the
duke
and
his
fortune
in
favour
makes
him
lag
behind
summon
a
parley
we
will
talk
with
him
a
parley
with
the
duke
of
burgundy
who
craves
a
parley
with
the
burgundy
the
princely
charles
of

thy
countryman
what
sayst
thou
charles
for
i
am
marching
hence
speak
pucelle
and
enchant
him
with
thy
words
brave
burgundy
undoubted
hope
of
france
stay
let
thy
humble
handmaid
speak
to
thee
speak
on
but
be
not
overtedious
look
on
thy
country
look
on
fertile
france
and
see
the
cities
and
the
towns
defacd
by
wasting
ruin
of
the
cruel
foe
as
looks
the
mother
on
her
lowly
babe
when
death
doth
close
his
tender
dying
eyes
see
see
the
pining
malady
of
france
behold
the
wounds
the
most
unnatural
wounds
which
thou
thyself
hast
givn
her
woeful
breast
o
turn
thy
edged
sword
another
way
strike
those
that
hurt
and
hurt
not
those
that
help
one
drop
of
blood
drawn
from
thy
countrys
bosom
should
grieve
thee
more
than
streams
of
foreign
gore
return
thee
therefore
with
a
flood
of
tears
and
wash
away
thy
countrys
stained
spots
either
she
hath
bewitchd
me
with
her
words
or
nature
makes
me
suddenly
relent
besides
all
french
and
france
exclaims
on
thee
doubting
thy
birth
and
lawful
progeny
who
joinst
thou
with
but
with
a
lordly
nation
that
will
not
trust
thee
but
for
profits
sake
when
talbot
hath
set
footing
once
in
france
and
fashiond
thee
that
instrument
of
ill
who
then
but
english
henry
will
be
lord
and
thou
be
thrust
out
like
a
fugitive
call
we
to
mind
and
mark
but
this
for
proof
was
not
the
duke
of
orleans
thy
foe
and
was
he
not
in
england
prisoner
but
when
they
heard
he
was
thine
enemy
they
set
him
free
without
his
ransom
paid
in
spite
of
burgundy
and
all
his
friends
see
then
thou
fightst
against
thy
countrymen
and
joinst
with
them
will
be
thy
slaughtermen
come
come

return
thou
wandring
lord
charles
and
the
rest
will
take
thee
in
their
arms
i
am
vanquished
these
haughty
words
of
hers
have
batterd
me
like
roaring
cannonshot
and
made
me
almost
yield
upon
my
knees
forgive
me

this
hearty
kind
embrace
my
forces
and
my

us
fresh
and
doth
beget
new
courage
in
our
breasts
pucelle

bravely
playd
her
part
in
this
and
doth
deserve
a
coronet
of
gold

powers
and

how
we
may
prejudice

of
your

in
this
realm
i
have
a
while

do
my
duty
to
my
sovereign

fifty
fortresses
twelve
cities

seven
walled

of
strength
beside
five
hundred
prisoners
of
esteem
lets
fall
his
sword
before
your

captain
and
victorious
lord
when

do
remember
how
my
father
said
a
stouter
champion
never
handled
sword
long
since
we
were
resolved
of
your
truth
your
faithful
service
and
your
toil
in
war
yet
never
have
you
tasted
our
reward
or
been
reguerdond
with
so
much
as
thanks
because
till

we
never
saw
your
face
therefore

up
and
for
these
good
deserts
we
here
create
you
earl
of
shrewsbury
and
in
our
coronation
take
your
place
now
sir
to
you
that
were
so
hot
at
sea
disgracing
of
these
colours
that
i
wear
in
honour
of
my
noble
lord
of
york
darst
thou
maintain
the
former
words
thou
spakst
yes
sir
as
well
as
you
dare
patronage
the
envious
barking
of
your
saucy
tongue
against
my
lord
the
duke
of
somerset
sirrah
thy
lord
i
honour
as
he
is
why
what
is
he
as
good
a
man
as
york
hark
ye
not
so
in
witness
take
ye
that
villain
thou
knowst
the
law
of
arms
is
such
that
whoso
draws
a
sword
tis
present
death
or
else
this
blow
should
broach
thy
dearest
blood
but
ill
unto
his
majesty
and
crave
i
may
have
liberty
to
venge
this
wrong
when
thou
shalt
see
ill
meet
thee
to
thy
cost
well
miscreant
ill
be
there
as
soon
as
you
and
after
meet
you
sooner
than
you
would
lord
bishop
set
the
crown
upon
his
head
god
save
king
henry
of
that
name
the
sixth
now
governor
of
paris
take
your
oath
that
you
elect
no
other
king
but
him
esteem
none
friends
but
such
as
are
his
friends
and
none
your
foes
but
such
as
shall
pretend
malicious
practices
against
his
state
this
shall
ye
do
so
help
you
righteous
god
my
gracious
sovereign
as
i
rode
from
calais
to
haste
unto
your
coronation
a
letter
was
deliverd
to
my
hands
writ
to
your
grace
from
the
duke
of
burgundy
shame
to
the
duke
of
burgundy
and
thee
i
vowd
base
knight
when
i
did
meet
thee
next
to
tear
the
garter
from
thy
cravens
leg
which
i
have
done
because
unworthily
thou
wast
installed
in
that
high
degree
pardon
me
princely
henry
and
the
rest
this
dastard
at
the
battle
of
patay
when
but
in
all
i
was
six
thousand
strong
and
that
the
french
were
almost
ten
to
one
before
we
met
or
that
a
stroke
was
given
like
to
a
trusty
squire
did
run
away
in
which
assault
we
lost
twelve
hundred
men
myself
and
divers
gentlemen
beside
were
there
surprisd
and
taken
prisoners
then
judge
great
lords
if
i
have
done
amiss
or
whether
that
such
cowards
ought
to
wear
this
ornament
of
knighthood
yea
or
no
to
say
the
truth
this
fact
was
infamous
and
ill
beseeming
any
common
man
much
more
a
knight
a
captain
and
a
leader
when
first
this
order
was
ordaind
my
lords
knights
of
the
garter
were
of
noble
birth
valiant
and
virtuous
full
of
haughty
courage
such
as
were
grown
to
credit
by
the
wars
not
fearing
death
nor
shrinking
for
distress
but
always
resolute
in
most
extremes
he
then
that
is
not
furnishd
in
this
sort
doth
but
usurp
the
sacred
name
of
knight
profaning
this
most
honourable
order
and
should
if
i
were
worthy
to
be
judge
be
quite
degraded
like
a
hedgeborn
swain
that
doth
presume
to
boast
of
gentle
blood
stain
to
thy
countrymen
thou
hearst
thy
doom
be
packing
therefore
thou
that
wast
a
knight
henceforth
we
banish
thee
on
pain
of
death
and
now
my
lord
protector
view
the
letter
sent
from
our
uncle
duke
of
burgundy
what
means
his
grace
that
he
hath
changd
his
style
no
more
but
plain
and
bluntly
to
the
king
hath
he
forgot
he
is
his
sovereign
or
doth
this
churlish
superscription
pretend
some
alteration
in
good
will
whats
here
i
have
upon
especial
cause
movd
with
compassion
of
my
countrys
wrack
together
with
the
pitiful
complaints
of
such
as
your
oppression
feeds
upon
forsaken
your
pernicious
faction
and
joind
with
charles
the
rightful
king
of
france
o
monstrous
treachery
can
this
be
so
that
in
alliance
amity
and
oaths
there
should
be
found
such
false
dissembling
guile
what
doth
my
uncle
burgundy
revolt
he
doth
my
lord
and
is
become
your
foe
is
that
the
worst
this
letter
doth
contain
it
is
the
worst
and
all
my
lord
he
writes
why
then
lord
talbot
there
shall
talk
with
him
and
give
him
chastisement
for
this
abuse
how
say
you
my
lord
are
you
not
content
content
my
liege
yes
but
that
i
am
prevented
i
should
have
beggd
i
might
have
been
employd
then
gather
strength
and
march
unto
him
straight
let
him
perceive
how
ill
we
brook
his
treason
and
what
offence
it
is
to
flout
his
friends
i
go
my
lord
in
heart
desiring
still
you
may
behold
confusion
of
your
foes
grant
me
the
combat
gracious
sovereign
and
me
my
lord
grant
me
the
combat
too
this
is
my
servant
hear
him
noble
prince
and
this
is
mine
sweet
henry
favour
him
be
patient
lords
and
give
them
leave
to
speak
say
gentlemen
what
makes
you
thus
exclaim
and
wherefore
crave
you
combat
or
with
whom
with
him
my
lord
for
he
hath
done
me
wrong
and
i
with
him
for
he
hath
done
me
wrong
what
is
that
wrong
whereof
you
both
complain
first
let
me
know
and
then
ill
answer
you
crossing
the
sea
from
england
into
france
this
fellow
here
with
envious
carping
tongue
upbraided
me
about
the
rose
i
wear
saying
the
sanguine
colour
of
the
leaves
did
represent
my
masters
blushing
cheeks
when
stubbornly
he
did
repugn
the
truth
about
a
certain
question
in
the
law
argud
betwixt
the
duke
of
york
and
him
with
other
vile
and
ignominious
terms
in
confutation
of
which
rude
reproach
and
in
defence
of
my
lords
worthiness
i
crave
the
benefit
of
law
of
arms
and
that
is
my
petition
noble
lord
for
though
he
seem
with
forged
quaint
conceit
to
set
a
gloss
upon
his
bold
intent
yet
know
my
lord
i
was
provokd
by
him
and
he
first
took
exceptions
at
this
badge
pronouncing
that
the
paleness
of
this
flower
bewrayd
the
faintness
of
my
masters
heart
will
not
this
malice
somerset
be
left
your
private
grudge
my
lord
of
york
will
out
though
neer
so
cunningly
you
smother
it
good
lord
what
madness
rules
in
brainsick
men
when
for
so
slight
and
frivolous
a
cause
such
factious
emulations
shall
arise
good
cousins
both
of
york
and
somerset
quiet
yourselves
i
pray
and
be
at
peace
let
this
dissension
first
be
tried
by
fight
and
then
your
highness
shall
command
a
peace
the
quarrel
toucheth
none
but
us
alone
betwixt
ourselves
let
us
decide
it
then
there
is
my
pledge
accept
it
somerset
nay
let
it
rest
where
it
began
at
first
confirm
it
so
mine
honourable
lord
confirm
it
so
confounded
be
your
strife
and
perish
ye
with
your
audacious
prate
presumptuous
vassals
are
you
not
ashamd
with
this
immodest
clamorous
outrage
to
trouble
and
disturb
the
king
and
us
and
you
my
lords
methinks
you
do
not
well
to
bear
with
their
perverse
objections
much
less
to
take
occasion
from
their
mouths
to
raise
a
mutiny
betwixt
yourselves
let
me
persuade
you
take
a
better
course
it
grieves
his
highness
good
my
lords
be
friends
come
hither
you
that
would
be
combatants
henceforth
i
charge
you
as
you
love
our
favour
quite
to
forget
this
quarrel
and
the
cause
and
you
my
lords
remember
where
we
are
in
france
amongst
a
fickle
wavring
nation
if
they
perceive
dissension
in
our
looks
and
that
within
ourselves
we
disagree
how
will
their
grudging
stomachs
be
provokd
to
wilful
disobedience
and
rebel
beside
what
infamy
will
there
arise
when
foreign
princes
shall
be
certified
that
for
a
toy
a
thing
of
no
regard
king
henrys
peers
and
chief
nobility
destroyd
themselves
and
lost
the
realm
of
france
o
think
upon
the
conquest
of
my
father
my
tender
years
and
let
us
not
forego
that
for
a
trifle
that
was
bought
with
blood
let
me
be
umpire
in
this
doubtful
strife
i
see
no
reason
if
i
wear
this
rose
that
any
one
should
therefore
be
suspicious
i
more
incline
to
somerset
than
york
both
are
my
kinsmen
and
i
love
them
both
as
well
they
may
upbraid
me
with
my
crown
because
forsooth
the
king
of
scots
is
crownd
but
your
discretions
better
can
persuade
than
i
am
able
to
instruct
or
teach
and
therefore
as
we
hither
came
in
peace
so
let
us
still
continue
peace
and
love
cousin
of
york
we
institute
your
grace
to
be
our
regent
in
these
parts
of
france
and
good
my
lord
of
somerset
unite
your
troops
of
horsemen
with
his
bands
of
foot
and
like
true
subjects
sons
of
your
progenitors
go
cheerfully
together
and
digest
your
angry
choler
on
your
enemies
ourself
my
lord
protector
and
the
rest
after
some
respite
will
return
to
calais
from
thence
to
england
where
i
hope
ere
long
to
be
presented
by
your
victories
with
charles
alen
on
and
that
traitorous
rout
my
lord
of
york
i
promise
you
the
king
prettily
methought
did
play
the
orator
and
so
he
did
but
yet
i
like
it
not
in
that
he
wears
the
badge
of
somerset
tush
that
was
but
his
fancy
blame
him
not
i
dare
presume
sweet
prince
he
thought
no
harm
an
if
i
wist
he
did
but
let
it
rest
other
affairs
must
now
be
managed
well
didst
thou
richard
to
suppress
thy
voice
for
had
the
passions
of
thy
heart
burst
out
i
fear
we
should
have
seen
decipherd
there
more
rancorous
spite
more
furious
raging
broils
than
yet
can
be
imagind
or
supposd
but
howsoeer
no
simple
man
that
sees
this
jarring
discord
of
nobility
this
shouldering
of
each
other
in
the
court
this
factious
bandying
of
their
favourites
but
that
it
doth
presage
some
ill
event
tis
much
when
sceptres
are
in
childrens
hands
but
more
when
envy
breeds
unkind
division
there
comes
the
ruin
there
begins
confusion
go
to
the
gates
of
bourdeaux
trumpeter
summon
their
general
unto
the
wall
english
john
talbot
captains
calls
you
forth
servant
in
arms
to
harry
king
of
england
and
thus
he
would
open
your
city
gates
be
humble
to
us
call
my
sovreign
yours
and
do
him
homage
as
obedient
subjects
and
ill
withdraw
me
and
my
bloody
power
but
if
you
frown
upon
this
profferd
peace
you
tempt
the
fury
of
my
three
attendants
lean
famine
quartering
steel
and
climbing
fire
who
in
a
moment
even
with
the
earth
shall
lay
your
stately
and
airbraving
towers
if
you
forsake
the
offer
of
their
love
thou
ominous
and
fearful
owl
of
death
our
nations
terror
and
their
bloody
scourge
the
period
of
thy
tyranny
approacheth
on
us
thou
canst
not
enter
but
by
death
for
i
protest
we
are
well
fortified
and
strong
enough
to
issue
out
and
fight
if
thou
retire
the
dauphin
well
appointed
stands
with
the
snares
of
war
to
tangle
thee
on
either
hand
thee
there
are
squadrons
pitchd
to
wall
thee
from
the
liberty
of
flight
and
no
way
canst
thou
turn
thee
for
redress
but
death
doth
front
thee
with
apparent
spoil
and
pale
destruction
meets
thee
in
the
face
ten
thousand
french
have
taen
the
sacrament
to
rive
their
dangerous
artillery
upon
no
christian
soul
but
english
talbot
lo
there
thou
standst
a
breathing
valiant
man
of
an
invincible
unconquerd
spirit
this
is
the
latest
glory
of
thy
praise
that
i
thy
enemy
due
thee
withal
for
ere
the
glass
that
now
begins
to
run
finish
the
process
of
his
sandy
hour
these
eyes
that
see
thee
now
well
coloured
shall

in
you
o
young
john
talbot
i
did
send
for
thee
to
tutor
thee
in
stratagems
of

that
talbots
name
might
be
in
thee
revivd
when
sapless
age
and
weak
unable
limbs
should
bring
thy
father
to
his
drooping
chair
but
o
malignant
and
illboding
stars
now
thou
art
come
unto
a
feast
of
death
a
terrible
and
unavoided
danger
therefore
dear
boy
mount
on
my
swiftest
horse
and
ill
direct
thee
how
thou
shalt
escape
by
sudden
flight
come
dally
not
be
gone
is
my
name
talbot
and
am
i
your
son
and
shall
i
fly
o
if
you
love
my
mother
dishonour
not
her
honourable
name
to
make
a
bastard
and
a
slave
of
me
the
world
will
say
he
is
not
talbots
blood
that
basely
fled
when
noble
talbot
stood
fly
to
revenge
my
death
if
i
be
slain
he
that
flies
so
will
neer
return
again
if
we
both
stay
we
both
are
sure
to
die
then
let
me
stay
and
father
do
you
fly
your
loss
is
great
so
your
regard
should
be
my
worth
unknown
no
loss
is
known
in
me
upon
my
death
the
french
can
little
boast
in
yours
they
will
in
you
all
hopes
are
lost
flight
cannot
stain
the
honour
you
have
won
but
mine
it
will
that
no
exploit
have
done
you
fled
for
vantage
everyone
will
swear
but
if
i
bow
theyll
say
it
was
for
fear
there
is
no
hope
that
ever
i
will
stay
if
the
first
hour
i
shrink
and
run
away
here
on
my
knee
i
beg
mortality
rather
than
life
preservd
with
infamy
shall
all
thy
mothers
hopes
lie
in
one
tomb
ay

than
ill
shame
my
mothers
womb

command
thee

to
fight
i
will
but
not
to
fly
the

of
thy
father

of
him

will
be
shame
in
me
thou
never
hadst
renown
nor
canst
not
lose
it
yes
your
renowned
name
shall
flight
abuse
it
thy
fathers
charge
shall
clear
thee
from
that
stain
you
cannot
witness
for
me
being
slain
if
death
be
so
apparent
then
both
fly
and
leave
my
followers
here
to
fight
and
die
my
age
was
never
tainted
with
such
shame
and
shall
my
youth
be
guilty
of
such
blame

triumphant
death
smeard
with
captivity
young
talbots
valour
makes
me
smile
at
thee
when
he
perceivd
me
shrink
and
on
my
knee
his
bloody
sword
he
brandishd
over
me
and
like
a
hungry
lion
did
commence
rough
deeds
of
rage
and
stern
impatience
but
when
my
angry
guardant
stood
alone
tendering
my
ruin
and
assaild
of
none
dizzyeyd
fury
and
great
rage
of
heart
suddenly
made
him
from
my
side
to
start
into
the
clustring
battle
of
the
french
and
in
that
sea
of
blood
my
boy
did
drench
his
overmounting
spirit
and
there
died
my
icarus
my
blossom
in
his
pride
o
my
dear
lord
lo
where
your
son
is
borne
thou
antick
death
which
laughst
us
here
to
scorn
anon
from
thy
insulting
tyranny
coupled
in
bonds
of
perpetuity
two
talbots
winged
through
the
lither
sky
in
thy
despite
shall
scape
mortality
o
thou
whose
wounds
become
hardfavourd

speak
to
thy

ere
thou
yield
thy
breath
brave
death
by
speaking
wher
he
will
or
no
imagine
him
a
frenchman
and
thy
foe
poor
boy
he
smiles
methinks
as
who
should
say
had
death
been
french
then
death
had
died
today
come
come
and
lay
him
in
his
fathers
arms
my
spirit
can
no
longer
bear
these
harms
soldiers
adieu
i
have
what
i
would
have
now
my
old
arms
are
young
john
talbots
grave
had
york
and
somerset
brought
rescue
in
we
should
have
found
a
bloody
day
of
this
how
the
young
whelp
of
talbots
ragingwood
did
flesh
his
puny
sword
in
frenchmens
blood
once
i
encounterd
him
and
thus
i
said
thou
maiden
youth
be
vanquishd
by
a
maid
but
with
a
proud
majestical
high
scorn
he
answerd
thus
young
talbot
was
not
born
to
be
the
pillage
of
a
giglot
wench
so
rushing
in
the
bowels
of
the
french
he
left
me
proudly
as
unworthy
fight
doubtless
he
would
have
made
a
noble
knight
see
where
he
lies
inhearsed
in
the
arms
of
the
most
bloody
nurser
of
his
harms
hew
them
to
pieces
hack
their
bones
asunder
whose
life
was
englands
glory
gallias

o
no

for
that
which
we
have
fled
during
the

always
thought
it

i
dare
not

fie

disable
not

hast
not
a

is
she
not
here
thy
prisoner
wilt
thou
be
daunted
at
a
womans
sight
ay
beautys
princely
majesty
is
such
confounds
the
tongue
and
makes
the
senses
rough
say
earl
of
suffolk
if
thy
name
be
so
what
ransom
must
i
pay
before
i
pass
for
i
perceive
i
am
thy
prisoner
how
canst
thou
tell
she
will
deny
thy
suit
before
thou
make
a
trial
of
her
love
why
speakst
thou
not
what
ransom
must
i
pay
shes
beautiful
and
therefore
to
be
wood
she
is
a
woman
therefore
to
be
won
wilt
thou
accept
of
ransom
yea
or
no
fond
man
remember
that
thou
hast
a
wife
then
how
can
margaret
be
thy
paramour
i
were
best
to
leave
him
for
he
will
not
hear
there
all
is
marrd
there
lies
a
cooling
card
he
talks
at
random
sure
the
man
is
mad
and
yet
a
dispensation
may
be
had
and
yet
i
would
that
you
would
answer
me
ill
win
this
lady
margaret
for
whom
why
for
my
king
tush
thats
a
wooden
thing
he
talks
of
wood
it
is
some
carpenter
yet
so
my
fancy
may
be
satisfied
and
peace
established
between
these
realms
but
there
remains
a
scruple
in
that
too
for
though
her
father
be
the
king
of
naples
duke
of
anjou
and
maine
yet
is
he
poor
and
our
nobility
will
scorn

suppose

bondage
happy
to

more
vile
than

a
slave
in
base
servility
for
princes

be
free
and
so

you

the
first
fruit
of
my
bachelorship
graceless
wilt
thou
deny
thy
parentage
this
argues
what
her
kind
of
life
hath
been
wicked
and
vile
and
so
her
death
concludes
fie
joan
that
thou
wilt
be
so

gave
thee
when
thou
suckdst
her
breast

been
a
little
ratsbane
for
thy

of
celestial
grace
to
work
exceeding
miracles
on

you

polluted
with
your
lusts
staind
with
the
guiltless
blood
of
innocents
corrupt
and
tainted
with
a
thousand
vices
because
you
want
the
grace

been
a
virgin
from
her
tender
infancy
chaste
and
immaculate
in

thought
whose
maiden
blood
thus
rigorously
effusd
will
cry
for
vengeance
at
the
gates
of
heaven
ay
ay
away
with
her
to
execution

sirs
because
she

with
remorse
of
these
outrageous
broils
have
earnestly
implord
a
general
peace
betwixt
our

and
here
at

the
dauphin
and
his

approacheth
to
confer
about
some

is
all
our
travail

to
this
effect
after
the
slaughter
of
so
many
peers
so
many
captains
gentlemen
and
soldiers
that
in
this
quarrel
have
been
overthrown
and
sold
their
bodies
for
their
countrys
benefit
shall
we
at
last
conclude
effeminate
peace
have
we
not
lost
most
part
of
all
the
towns
by
treason
falsehood
and
by
treachery
our
great
progenitors
had
conquered
o
warwick
warwick
i
foresee
with
grief
the
utter
loss
of
all
the
realm
of

be
patient
york
if
we
conclude
a
peace
it
shall
be
with
such
strict
and
severe
covenants
as
little
shall
the
frenchmen
gain
thereby
since
lords
of
england
it
is
thus
agreed
that
peaceful
truce
shall
be
proclaimd
in
france
we
come
to
be
informed
by
yourselves
what
the
conditions
of
that
league
must
be
speak
winchester
for
boiling
choler
chokes
the
hollow
passage
of
my
poisond
voice
by
sight
of
these
our
baleful
enemies
charles
and
the
rest
it
is
enacted
thus
that
in
regard
king
henry
gives
consent
of
mere
compassion
and
of
lenity
to
ease
your
country
of
distressful
war
and
suffer
you
to
breathe
in
fruitful
peace
you
shall
become
true
liegemen
to
his
crown
and
charles
uponcondition
thou
wilt
swear
to
pay
him
tribute
and
submit
thyself
thou
shalt
be
placd
as
viceroy
under
him
and
still
enjoy
thy
regal
dignity
must
he
be
then
as
shadow
of
himself
adorn
his
temples
with
a
coronet
and
yet
in
substance
and
authority
retain
but
privilege
of
a
private
man
this
proffer
is
absurd
and
reasonless
tis
known
already
that
i
am
possessd
with
more
than
half
the
gallian
territories
and
therein
reverencd
for
their
lawful
king
shall
i
for
lucre
of
the
rest
unvanquishd
detract
so
much
from
that
prerogative
as
to
be
calld
but
viceroy
of
the
whole
no
lord
ambassador
ill
rather
keep
that
which
i
have
than
coveting
for
more
be
cast
from
possibility
of
all
insulting
charles
hast
thou
by
secret
means
usd
intercession
to
obtain
a
league
and
now
the
matter
grows
to
compromise
standst
thou
aloof
upon
comparison
either
accept
the
title
thou
usurpst
of
benefit
proceeding
from
our
king
and
not
of
any
challenge
of
desert
or
we
will
plague
thee
with
incessant
wars
my
lord
you
do
not
well
in
obstinacy
to
cavil
in
the
course
of
this
contract
if
once
it
be
neglected
ten
to
one
we
shall
not
find
like
opportunity
to
say
the
truth
it
is
your
policy
to
save
your
subjects
from
such
massacre
and
ruthless
slaughters
as
are
daily
seen
by
our
proceeding
in
hostility
and
therefore
take
this
compact
of
a
truce
although
you
break
it
when
your
pleasure
serves
how
sayst
thou
charles
shall
our
condition
stand
it
shall
only
reservd
you
claim
no
interest
in
any
of
our
towns
of
garrison
then
swear
allegiance
to
his
majesty
as
thou
art
knight
never
to
disobey
nor
be
rebellious
to
the
crown
of
england
thou
nor
thy
nobles
to
the
crown
of
england
so
now
dismiss
your
army
when
ye
please
hang
up
your
ensigns
let
your
drums
be
still
for
here
we
entertain
a
solemn
peace
your
wondrous
rare
description
noble
earl
of
beauteous
margaret
hath
astonishd
me
her
virtues
graced
with
external
gifts
do
breed
loves
settled
passions
in
my
heart
and
like
as
rigour
of
tempestuous
gusts
provokes
the
mightiest
hulk
against
the
tide
so
am
i
driven
by
breath
of
her
renown
either
to
suffer
shipwrack
or
arrive
where
i
may
have
fruition
of
her
love
tush
my
good
lord
this
superficial
tale
is
but
a
preface
of
her
worthy
praise
the
chief
perfections
of
that
lovely
dame
had
i
sufficient
skill
to
utter
them
would
make
a
volume
of
enticing
lines
able
to
ravish
any
dull
conceit
and
which
is
more
she
is
not
so
divine
so
full
replete
with
choice
of
all
delights
but
with
as
humble
lowliness
of
mind
she
is
content
to
be
at
your
command
command
i
mean
of
virtuous
chaste
intents
to
love
and
honour
henry
as
her
lord
and
otherwise
will
henry
neer
presume
therefore
my
lord
protector
give
consent
that
margaret
may
be
englands
royal
queen
so
should
i
give
consent
to
flatter
sin
you
know
my
lord
your
highness
is
betrothd
unto
another
lady
of
esteem
how
shall
we
then
dispense
with
that
contract
and
not
deface
your
honour
with
reproach
as
doth
a
ruler
with
unlawful
oaths
or
one
that
at
a
triumph
having
vowd
to
try
his
strength
forsaketh
yet
the
lists
by
reason
of
his
adversarys
odds
a
poor
earls
daughter
is
unequal
odds
and
therefore
may
be
broke
without
offence
why
what
i
pray
is
margaret
more
than
that
her
father
is
no
better
than
an
earl
although
in
glorious
titles
he
excel
yes
my
good
lord
her
father
is
a
king
the
king
of
naples
and
jerusalem
and
of
such
great
authority
in
france
as
his
alliance
will
confirm
our
peace
and
keep
the
frenchmen
in
allegiance
and
so
the
earl
of
armagnac
may
do
because
he
is
near
kinsman
unto
charles
beside
his
wealth
doth
warrant
liberal
dower
where
reignier
sooner
will
receive
than
give
a
dower
my
lords
disgrace
not
so
your
king
that
he
should
be
so
abject
base
and
poor
to
choose
for
wealth
and
not
for
perfect
love
henry
is
able
to
enrich
his
queen
and
not
to
seek
a
queen
to
make
him
rich
so
worthless
peasants
bargain
for
their
wives
as
marketmen
for
oxen
sheep
or
horse
marriage
is
a
matter
of
more
worth
than
to
be
dealt
in
by
attorneyship
not
whom
we
will
but
whom
his
grace
affects
must
be
companion
of
his
nuptial
bed
and
therefore
lords
since
he
affects
her
most
it
most
of
all
these
reasons
bindeth
us
in
our
opinions
she
should
be
preferrd
for
what
is
wedlock
forced
but
a
hell
an
age
of
discord
and
continual
strife
whereas
the
contrary
bringeth
bliss
and
is
a
pattern
of
celestial
peace
whom
should
we
match
with
henry
being
a
king
but
margaret
that
is
daughter
to
a
king
her
peerless
feature
joined
with
her
birth
approves
her
fit
for
none
but
for
a
king
her
valiant
courage
and
undaunted
spirit
more
than
in
women
commonly
is
seen
will
answer
our
hope
in
issue
of
a
king
for
henry
son
unto
a
conqueror
is
likely
to
beget
more
conquerors
if
with
a
lady
of
so
high
resolve
as
is
fair
margaret
he
be
linkd
in
love
then
yield
my
lords
and
here
conclude
with
me
that
margaret
shall
be
queen
and
none
but
she
whether
it
be
through
force
of
your
report
my
noble
lord
of
suffolk
or
for
that
my
tender
youth
was
never
yet
attaint
with
any
passion
of
inflaming
love
i
cannot
tell
but
this
i
am
assurd
i
feel
such
sharp
dissension
in
my
breast
such
fierce
alarums
both
of
hope
and
fear
as
i
am
sick
with
working
of
my
thoughts
take
therefore
shipping
post
my
lord
to
france
agree
to
any
covenants
and
procure
that
lady
margaret
do
vouchsafe
to
come
to
cross
the
seas
to
england
and
be
crownd
king
henrys
faithful
and
anointed
queen
for
your
expenses
and
sufficient
charge
among
the
people
gather
up
a
tenth
be
gone
i
say
for
till
you
do
return
i
rest
perplexed
with
a
thousand
cares
and
you
good
uncle
banish
all
offence
if
you
do
censure
me
by
what
you
were
not
what
you
are
i
know
it
will
excuse
this
sudden
execution
of
my
will
and
so
conduct
me
where
from
company
i
may
revolve
and
ruminate
my
grief
ay
grief
i
fear
me
both
at
first
and
last
thus
suffolk
hath
prevaild
and
thus
he
goes
as
did
the
youthful
paris
once
to
greece
with
hope
to
find
the
like
event
in
love
but
prosper
better
than
the
trojan
did
margaret
shall
now
be
queen
and
rule
the
king
but
i
will
rule
both
her
the
king
and
realm
the
life
and
death
of
king
john
now
say
chatillon
what
would
france
with
us
thus
after
greeting
speaks
the
king
of
france
in
my
behaviour
to
the
majesty
the
borrowd
majesty
of
england
here
a
strange
beginning
borrowd
majesty
silence
good

hear
the
embassy
philip
of
france
in
right
and
true
behalf
of
thy
deceased
brother
geffreys
son
arthur
plantagenet
lays
most
lawful
claim
to
this
fair
island
and
the

poictiers
anjou

desiring
thee
to
lay
aside
the

which
sways
usurpingly
these
several
titles
and
put
the
same
into
young
arthurs
hand
thy
nephew
and
right

what
follows
if
we
disallow
of
this
the
proud
control
of
fierce
and
bloody
war
to
enforce
these
rights
so
forcibly
withheld
here
have
we
war

answer
france
then
take
my

defiance
from

of

so
depart

for
ere
thou

hence

presage
of
your

decay
an

let
him
have

look
tot
farewell
chatillon
what
now
my
son
have
i
not
ever
said
how
that
ambitious
constance
would
not
cease
till
she
had
kindled
france
and
all
the
world
upon
the
right
and
party
of
her
son
this
might
have
been
prevented
and
made
whole
with
very
easy
arguments
of
love
which
now
the
manage
of
two
kingdoms
must
with
fearful
bloody
issue
arbitrate
our
strong
possession
and
our
right
for
us
your
strong
possession
much
more
than
your
right
or
else
it
must
go
wrong
with
you
and
me
so
much
my
conscience
whispers
in
your
ear
which
none
but
heaven
and
you
and
i
shall
hear
my
liege
here
is
the
strangest
controversy
come
from
the
country
to
be
judgd
by
you
that
eer
i
heard
shall
i
produce
the
men
let
them
approach
our
abbeys
and
our
priories
shall
pay
this
expeditions
charge
what
men
are
you
your
faithful
subject
i
a
gentleman
born
in
northamptonshire
and
eldest
son
as
i
suppose
to
robert
faulconbridge
a
soldier
by
the
honourgiving
hand
of
c
urdelion
knighted
in
the
field
what
art
thou
the
son
and
heir
to
that
same
faulconbridge
is
that
the
elder
and
art
thou
the
heir
you
came
not
of
one
mother
then
it
seems
most
certain
of
one
mother
mighty
king
that
is
well
known
and
as
i
think
one
father
but
for
the
certain
knowledge
of
that
truth
i
put
you
oer
to
heaven
and
to
my
mother
of
that
i
doubt
as
all
mens
children
may
out
on
thee
rude
man
thou
dost
shame
thy
mother
and
wound
her
honour
with
this
diffidence
i
madam
no
i
have
no
reason
for
it
that
is
my
brothers
plea
and
none
of
mine
the
which
if
he
can
prove
a
pops
me
out
at
least
from
fair
five
hundred
pound
a
year
heaven
guard
my
mothers
honour
and
my
land
a
good
blunt
fellow
why
being
younger
born
doth
he
lay
claim
to
thine
inheritance
i
know
not
why
except
to
get
the
land
but
once
he
slanderd
me
with
bastardy
but
wher
i
be
as
truebegot
or
no
that
still
i
lay
upon
my
mothers
head
but
that
i
am
as
wellbegot
my
liege
fair
fall
the
bones
that
took
the
pains
for
me
compare
our
faces
and
be
judge
yourself
if
old
sir
robert
did
beget
us
both
and
were
our
father
and
this
son
like
him
o
old
sir
robert
father
on
my
knee
i
give
heaven
thanks
i
was
not
like
to
thee
why
what
a
madcap
hath
heaven
lent
us
here
he
hath
a
trick
of
c
urdelions
face
the
accent
of
his
tongue
affecteth
him
do
you
not
read
some
tokens
of
my
son
in
the
large
composition
of
this
man
mine
eye
hath
well
examined
his
parts
and
finds
them
perfect
richard
sirrah
speak
what
doth
move
you
to
claim
your
brothers
land
because
he
hath
a
halfface
like
my
father
with
half
that
face
would
he
have
all
my
land
a
halffacd
groat
five
hundred
pound
a
year
my
gracious
liege
when
that
my
father
livd
your
brother
did
employ
my
father
much
well
sir
by
this
you
cannot
get
my
land
your
tale
must
be
how
he
employd
my
mother
and
once
dispatchd
him
in
an
embassy
to
germany
there
with
the
emperor
to
treat
of
high
affairs
touching
that
time
the
advantage
of
his
absence
took
the
king
and
in
the
mean
time
sojournd
at
my
fathers
where
how
he
did
prevail
i
shame
to
speak
but
truth
is
truth
large
lengths
of
seas
and
shores
between
my
father
and
my
mother
lay
as
i
have
heard
my
father
speak
himself
when
this
same
lusty
gentleman
was
got
upon
his
deathbed
he
by
will
bequeathd
his
lands
to
me
and
took
it
on
his
death
that
this
my
mothers
son
was
none
of
his
an
if
he
were
he
came
into
the
world
full
fourteen
weeks
before
the
course
of
time
then
good
my
liege
let
me
have
what
is
mine
my
fathers
land
as
was
my
fathers
will
sirrah
your
brother
is
legitimate
your
fathers
wife
did
after
wedlock
bear
him
and
if
she
did
play
false
the
fault
was
hers
which
fault
lies
on
the
hazards
of
all
husbands
that
marry
wives
tell
me
how
if
my
brother
who
as
you
say
took
pains
to
get
this
son
had
of
your
father
claimd
this
son
for
his
in
sooth
good
friend
your
father
might
have
kept
this
calf
bred
from
his
cow
from
all
the
world
in
sooth
he
might
then
if
he
were
my
brothers
my
brother
might
not
claim
him
nor
your
father
being
none
of
his
refuse
him
this
concludes
my
mothers
son
did
get
your
fathers
heir
your
fathers
heir
must
have
your
fathers
land
shall
then
my
fathers
will
be
of
no
force
to
dispossess
that
child
which
is
not
his
of
no
more
force
to
dispossess
me
sir
than
was
his
will
to
get
me
as
i
think
wher
hadst
thou
rather
be
a
faulconbridge
and
like
thy
brother
to
enjoy
thy
land
or
the
reputed
son
of
c
urdelion
lord
of
thy
presence
and
no
land
beside
madam
an
if
my
brother
had
my
shape
and
i
had
his
sir
robert
his
like
him
and
if
my
legs
were
two
such
ridingrods
my
arms
such
eelskins
stuffd
my
face
so
thin
that
in
mine
ear
i
durst
not
stick
a
rose
lest
men
should
say
look
where
threefarthings
goes
and
to
his
shape
were
heir
to
all
this
land
would
i
might
never
stir
from
off
this
place
id
give
it
every
foot
to
have
this
face
i
would
not
be
sir
nob

ours
against

persever
not
but
hear
me
mighty
kings
speak
on
with

we
are
bent
to
hear
that
daughter
there
of
spain
the
lady
blanch
is
near
to
england
look
upon
the
years
of
lewis
the
dauphin
and
that
lovely
maid
if
lusty
love
should
go
in
quest
of
beauty
where
should
he
find
it
fairer
than
in
blanch
if
zealous
love
should
go
in
search
of
virtue
where
should
he
find
it
purer
than
in
blanch
if
love
ambitious
sought
a
match
of
birth
whose
veins
bound
richer
blood
than
lady
blanch
such
as
she
is
in
beauty
virtue
birth
is
the
young
dauphin
every
way
complete
if
not
complete
of
say
he
is
not
she
and
she
again
wants
nothing
to
name
want
if
want
it
be
not
that
she
is
not
he
he
is
the
half
part
of
a
blessed
man
left
to
be
finished
by
such
a
she
and
she
a
fair
divided
excellence
whose
fulness
of
perfection
lies
in
him
o
two
such
silver
currents
when
they
join
do
glorify
the
banks
that
bound
them
in
and
two
such
shores
to
two
such
streams
made
one
two
such
controlling
bounds
shall
you
be
kings
to
these
two
princes
if
you
marry
them
this
union
shall
do
more
than
battery
can
to
our
fastclosed
gates
for
at
this
match
with
swifter
spleen
than
powder
can
enforce
the
mouth
of
passage
shall
we
fling
wide
ope
and
give
you
entrance
but
without
this
match
the
sea
enraged
is
not
half
so
deaf
lions
more
confident
mountains
and
rocks
more
free
from
motion
no
not
death
himself
in
mortal
fury
half
so
peremptory
as
we
to
keep
this
city
heres
a
stay
that
shakes
the
rotten
carcase
of
old
death
out
of
his
rags
heres
a
large
mouth
indeed
that
spits
forth
death
and
mountains
rocks
and
seas
talks
as
familiarly
of
roaring
lions
as

of
thirteen
do
of

plain

fire

he
gives
the

with
his

our
ears
are
cudgelld
not
a

but
buffets
better
than
a

zounds
i
was
never
so
bethumpd
with
words
since
i
first
calld
my
brothers
father
dad
son
list
to
this
conjunction
make
this
match
give
with
our
niece
a
dowry
large
enough
for
by
this
knot
thou
shalt
so
surely
tie
thy
now
unsurd
assurance
to
the
crown
that
yon
green
boy
shall
have
no
sun
to
ripe
the
bloom
that
promiseth
a
mighty
fruit
i
see
a
yielding
in
the
looks
of
france
mark
how
they
whisper
urge
them
while
their
souls
are
capable
of
this
ambition
lest
zeal
now
melted
by
the
windy
breath
of
soft
petitions
pity
and
remorse
cool
and
congeal
again
to
what
it
was
why
answer
not
the
double
majesties
this
friendly
treaty
of
our
threatend
town
speak
england
first
that
hath
been
forward
first
to
speak
unto
this
city
what
say
you
if
that
the
dauphin
there
thy
princely
son
can
in
this
book
of
beauty
read
i
love
her
dowry
shall
weigh
equal
with
a
queen
for
anjou
and
fair
touraine
maine
poictiers
and
all
that
we
upon
this
side
the
sea
except
this
city
now
by
us
besiegd
find
liable
to
our
crown
and
dignity
shall
gild
her
bridal
bed
and
make
her
rich
in
titles
honours
and
promotions
as
she
in
beauty
education
blood
holds
hand
with
any
princess
of
the
world
what
sayst
thou
boy
look
in
the
ladys
face
i
do
my
lord
and
in
her
eye
i
find
a
wonder
or
a
wondrous
miracle
the
shadow
of
myself
formd
in
her
eye
which
being
but
the
shadow
of
your
son
becomes
a
sun
and
makes
your
son
a
shadow
i
do
protest
i
never
lovd
myself
till
now
infixed
i
beheld
myself
drawn
in
the
flattering
table
of
her
eye
drawn
in
the
flattering
table
of
her
eye
hangd
in
the
frowning
wrinkle
of
her
brow
and
quarterd
in
her
heart
he
doth
espy
himself
loves
traitor
this
is
pity
now
that
hangd
and
drawn
and
quarterd
there
should
be
in
such
a
love
so
vile
a
lout
as
he
my
uncles
will
in
this
respect
is
mine
if
he
see
aught
in
you
that
makes
him
like
that
anything
he
sees
which
moves
his
liking
i
can
with
ease
translate
it
to
my
will
or
if
you
will
to
speak
more
properly
i
will
enforce
it
easily
to
my
love
further
i
will
not
flatter
you
my
lord
that
all
i
see
in
you
is
worthy
love
than
this
that
nothing
do
i
see
in
you
though
churlish
thoughts
themselves
should
be
your
judge
that
i
can
find
should
merit
any
hate
what
say
these
young
ones
what
say
you
my
niece
that
she
is
bound
in
honour
still
to
do
what
you
in
wisdom
still
vouchsafe
to
say
speak
then
prince
dauphin
can
you
love
this
lady
nay
ask
me
if
i
can
refrain
from
love
for
i
do
love
her
most
unfeignedly
then
do
i
give
volquessen
touraine
maine
poictiers
and
anjou
these
five
provinces
with
her
to
thee
and
this
addition
more
full
thirty
thousand
marks
of
english
coin
philip
of
france
if
thou
be
pleasd
withal
command
thy
son
and
daughter
to
join
hands

me
who
knows
she
is
sad
and
passionate
at
your
highness
tent
and
by
my
faith
this
league
that

made

give
her
sadness
very
little
cure
brother
of
england
how
may
we
content
this
widow

here
comes
the
holy
legate
of
the
pope
hail
you
anointed
deputies
of
heaven
to
thee
king
john
my
holy
errand
is
i
pandulph
of
fair
milan
cardinal
and
from
pope
innocent
the
legate
here
do
in
his
name
religiously
demand
why
thou
against
the
church
our
holy
mother
so
wilfully
dost
spurn
and
force
perforce
keep
stephen
langton
chosen
archbishop
of
canterbury
from
that
holy
see
this
in
our
foresaid
holy
fathers
name
pope
innocent
i
do
demand
of
thee
what
earthly
name
to
interrogatories
can
task
the
free
breath
of
a
sacred
king
thou
canst
not
cardinal
devise
a
name
so
slight
unworthy
and
ridiculous
to
charge
me
to
an
answer
as
the
pope
tell
him
this
tale
and
from
the
mouth
of
england
add
thus
much
more
that
no
italian
priest
shall
tithe
or
toll
in
our
dominions
but
as
we
under
heaven
are
supreme
head
so
under
him
that
great
supremacy
where
we
do
reign
we
will
alone
uphold
without
the
assistance
of
a
mortal
hand
so
tell
the
pope
all
reverence
set
apart
to
him
and
his
usurpd
authority
brother
of
england
you
blaspheme
in
this
though
you
and
all
the
kings
of
christendom
are
led
so
grossly
by
this
meddling
priest
dreading
the
curse
that
money
may
buy
out
and
by
the
merit
of
vile
gold
dross
dust
purchase
corrupted
pardon
of
a
man
who
in
that
sale
sells
pardon
from
himself
though
you
and
all
the
rest
so
grossly
led
this
juggling
witchcraft
with
revenue
cherish
yet
i
alone
alone
do
me
oppose
against
the
pope
and
count
his
friends
my
foes
then
by
the
lawful
power
that
i
have
thou
shalt
stand
cursd
and
excommunicate
and
blessed
shall
he
be
that
doth
revolt
from
his
allegiance
to
a
heretic
and
meritorious
shall
that
hand
be
calld
canonized
and
worshippd
as
a
saint
that
takes
away
by
any
secret
course
thy
hateful
life
o
lawful
let
it
be
that
i
have
room
with
rome
to
curse
awhile
good
father
cardinal
cry
thou
amen
to
my
keen
curses
for
without
my
wrong
there
is
no
tongue
hath
power
to
curse
him
right
theres
law
and
warrant
lady
for
my
curse
and
for
mine
too
when
law
can
do
no
right
let
it
be
lawful
that
law
bar
no
wrong
law
cannot
give
my
child
his
kingdom
here
for
he
that
holds
his
kingdom
holds
the
law
therefore
since
law
itself
is
perfect
wrong
how
can
the
law
forbid
my
tongue
to
curse
philip
of
france
on
peril
of
a
curse
let
go
the
hand
of
that
archheretic
and
raise
the
power
of
france
upon
his
head
unless
he
do
submit
himself
to
rome
lookst
thou
pale
france
do
not
let
go
thy
hand
look
to
that
devil
lest
that
france
repent
and
by
disjoining
hands
hell
lose
a
soul
king
philip
listen
to
the
cardinal
and
hang
a
calfsskin
on
his
recreant
limbs
well
ruffian
i
must
pocket
up
these
wrongs
because
your
breeches
best
may
carry
them
philip
what
sayst
thou
to
the
cardinal
what
should
he
say
but
as
the
cardinal
bethink
you
father
for
the
difference
is
purchase
of
a
heavy
curse
from
rome
or
the
light
loss
of
england
for
a
friend
forego
the
easier
thats
the
curse
of
rome
o
lewis
stand
fast
the
devil
tempts
thee
here
in
likeness
of
a
new
untrimmed
bride
the
lady
constance
speaks
not
from
her
faith
but
from
her
need
o
if
thou
grant
my
need
which
only
lives
but
by
the
death
of
faith
that
need
must
needs
infer
this
principle
that
faith
would
live
again
by
death
of
need
o
then
tread
down
my
need
and
faith
mounts
up
keep
my
need
up
and
faith
is
trodden
down
the
king
is
movd
and
answers
not
to
this
o
be
removd
from
him
and
answer
well
do
so
king
philip
hang
no
more
in
doubt
hang
nothing
but
a
calfsskin
most
sweet
lout
i
am
perplexd
and
know
not
what
to
say
what
canst
thou
say
but
will
perplex
thee
more
if
thou
stand
excommunicate
and
cursd
good
reverend
father
make
my
person
yours
and
tell
me
how
you
would
bestow
yourself
this
royal
hand
and
mine
are
newly
knit
and
the
conjunction
of
our
inward
souls
married
in
league
coupled
and
linkd
together
with
all
religious
strength
of
sacred
vows
the
latest
breath
that
gave
the
sound
of
words
was
deepsworn
faith
peace
amity
true
love
between
our
kingdoms
and
our
royal
selves
and
even
before
this
truce
but
new
before
no
longer
than
we
well
could
wash
our
hands
to
clap
this
royal
bargain
up
of
peace
heaven
knows
they
were
besmeard
and
overstaind
with
slaughters
pencil
where
revenge
did
paint
the
fearful
difference
of
incensed
kings
and
shall
these
hands
so
lately
purgd
of
blood
so
newly
joind
in
love
so
strong
in
both
unyoke
this
seizure
and
this
kind
regreet
play
fast
and
loose
with
faith
so
jest
with
heaven
make
such
unconstant
children
of
ourselves
as
now
again
to
snatch
our
palm
from
palm
unswear
faith
sworn
and
on
the
marriagebed
of
smiling
peace
to
march
a
bloody
host
and
make
a
riot
on
the
gentle
brow
of
true
sincerity
o
holy
sir
my
reverend
father
let
it
not
be
so
out
of
your
grace
devise
ordain
impose
some
gentle
order
and
then
we
shall
be
blessd
to
do
your
pleasure
and
continue
friends
all
form
is
formless
order
orderless
save
what
is
opposite
to
englands
love
therefore
to
arms
be
champion
of
our
church
or
let
the
church
our
mother
breathe
her
curse
a
mothers
curse
on
her
revolting
son
france
thou
mayst
hold
a
serpent
by
the
tongue
a
chafed
lion
by
the
mortal
paw
a
fasting
tiger
safer
by
the
tooth
than
keep
in
peace
that
hand
which
thou
dost
hold
i
may
disjoin
my
hand
but
not
my
faith
so
makst
thou
faith
an
enemy
to
faith
and
like
a
civil
war
settst
oath
to
oath
thy
tongue
against
thy
tongue
o
let
thy
vow
first
made
to
heaven
first
be
to
heaven
performd
that
is
to
be
the
champion
of
our
church
what
since
thou
sworst
is
sworn
against
thyself
and
may
not
be
performed
by
thyself
for
that
which
thou
hast
sworn
to
do
amiss
is
not
amiss
when
it
is
truly
done
and
being
not
done
where
doing
tends
to
ill
the
truth
is
then
most
done
not
doing
it
the
better
act
of
purposes
mistook
is
to
mistake
again
though
indirect
yet
indirection
thereby
grows
direct
and
falsehood
falsehood
cures
as
fire
cools
fire
within
the
scorched
veins
of
one
newburnd
it
is
religion
that
doth
make
vows
kept
but
thou
hast
sworn
against
religion
by
what
thou
swearst
against
the
thing
thou
swearst
and
makst
an
oath
the
surety
for
thy
truth
against
an
oath
the
truth
thou
art
unsure
to
swear
swears
only
not
to
be
forsworn
else
what
a
mockery
should
it
be
to
swear
but
thou
dost
swear
only
to
be
forsworn
and
most
forsworn
to
keep
what
thou
dost
swear
therefore
thy
later
vows
against
thy
first

of
our

hubert
o
my

hubert
we
owe
thee
much
within
this
wall
of

there
is
a
soul
counts
thee
her
creditor
and
with
advantage
means
to
pay
thy
love
and
my
good
friend
thy
voluntary
oath
lives
in
this
bosom
dearly
cherished
give
me
thy
hand
i
had
a
thing
to
say
but
i
will
fit
it
with
some
better
time
by
heaven
hubert
i
am
almost
ashamd
to
say
what
good
respect
i
have
of
thee
i
am
much
bounden
to
your
majesty
good
friend
thou
hast
no
cause
to
say
so
yet
but
thou
shalt
have
and
creep
time
neer
so
slow
yet
it
shall
come
for
me
to
do
thee
good
i
had
a
thing
to
say
but
let
it
go
the
sun
is
in
the
heaven
and
the
proud
day
attended
with
the
pleasures
of
the
world
is
all
too
wanton
and
too
full
of
gawds
to
give
me
audience
if
the
midnight
bell
did
with
his
iron
tongue
and
brazen
mouth
sound
one
into
the
drowsy
race
of
night
if
this
same
were
a
churchyard
where
we
stand
and
thou
possessed
with
a
thousand
wrongs
or
if
that
surly
spirit
melancholy
had
bakd
thy
blood
and
made
it
heavythick
which
else
runs
tickling
up
and
down
the
veins
making
that
idiot
laughter
keep
mens
eyes
and
strain
their
cheeks
to
idle
merriment
a
passion
hateful
to
my
purposes
or
if
that
thou
couldst
see
me
without
eyes
hear
me
without
thine
ears
and
make
reply
without
a
tongue
using
conceit
alone
without
eyes
ears
and
harmful
sound
of
words
then
in
despite
of
brooded
watchful
day
i
would
into
thy
bosom
pour
my
thoughts
but
ah
i
will
not
yet
i
love
thee
well
and
by
my
troth
i
think
thou
lovst
me
well
so
well
that
what
you
bid
me
undertake
though
that
my
death
were
adjunct
to
my
act

rottenness
arise
forth
from
the
couch
of
lasting
night
thou
hate
and
terror
to
prosperity
and
i
will
kiss
thy
detestable
bones
and
put
my
eyeballs
in
thy
vaulty
brows
and
ring
these
fingers
with
thy
household
worms
and
stop
this
gap
of
breath
with
fulsome
dust
and
be
a
carrion
monster
like
thyself
come
grin
on
me
and
i
will
think
thou
smilst
and
buss
thee
as
thy
wife
miserys
love
o
come
to
me
o
fair
affliction
peace
no
no
i
will
not
having
breath
to
cry
o
that
my
tongue
were
in
the
thunders
mouth
then
with
a
passion
would
i
shake
the
world
and
rouse
from
sleep
that
fell
anatomy
which
cannot
hear
a
ladys
feeble
voice
which
scorns
a
modern
invocation
lady
you
utter
madness
and
not
sorrow
thou
art
not
holy
to
belie
me
so
i
am
not
mad
this
hair
i
tear
is
mine
my
name
is
constance
i
was
geffreys
wife
young
arthur
is
my
son
and
he
is
lost
i
am
not
mad
i
would
to
heaven
i
were
for
then
tis
like
i
should
forget
myself
o
if
i
could
what
grief
should
i
forget
preach
some
philosophy
to
make
me
mad
and
thou
shalt
be
canonizd
cardinal
for
being
not
mad
but
sensible
of
grief
my
reasonable
part
produces
reason
how
i
may
be
deliverd
of
these
woes
and
teaches
me
to
kill
or
hang
myself
if
i
were
mad
i
should
forget
my
son
or
madly
think
a
babe
of
clouts
were
he
i
am
not
mad
too
well
too
well
i
feel
the
different
plague
of
each
calamity
bind
up
those
tresses
o
what
love
i
note
in
the
fair
multitude
of
those
her
hairs
where
but
by
chance
a
silver
drop
hath
fallen
even
to
that
drop
ten
thousand
wiry
friends
do
glue
themselves
in
sociable
grief
like
true
inseparable
faithful
loves
sticking
together
in
calamity
to
england
if
you
will
bind
up
your
hairs
yes
that
i
will
and
wherefore
will
i
do
it
i
tore
them
from
their
bonds
and
cried
aloud
o
that
these
hands
could
so
redeem
my
son
as
they
have
given
these
hairs
their
liberty
but
now
i
envy
at
their
liberty
and
will
again
commit
them
to
their
bonds
because
my
poor
child
is
a
prisoner
and
father
cardinal
i
have
heard
you
say
that
we
shall
see
and
know
our
friends
in
heaven
if
that
be
true
i
shall
see
my
boy
again
for
since
the
birth
of
cain
the
first
male
child
to
him
that
did
but
yesterday
suspire
there
was
not
such
a
gracious
creature
born
but
now
will
cankersorrow
eat
my
bud
and
chase
the
native
beauty
from
his
cheek
and
he
will
look
as
hollow
as
a
ghost
as
dim
and
meagre
as
an
agues
fit
and
so
hell
die
and
rising
so
again
when
i
shall
meet
him
in
the
court
of
heaven
i
shall
not
know
him
therefore
never
never
must
i
behold
my
pretty
arthur
more
you
hold
too
heinous
a
respect
of
grief
he
talks
to
me
that
never
had
a
son
you
are
as
fond
of
grief
as
of
your
child
grief
fills
the
room
up
of
my
absent
child
lies
in
his
bed
walks
up
and
down
with
me
puts
on
his
pretty
looks
repeats
his
words
remembers
me
of
all
his
gracious
parts
stuffs
out
his
vacant
garments
with
his
form
then
have
i
reason
to
be
fond
of
grief
fare
you
well
had
you
such
a
loss
as
i
i
could
give
better
comfort
than
you
do
i
will
not
keep
this
form
upon
my
head
when
there
is
such
disorder
in
my
wit
o
lord
my
boy
my
arthur
my
fair
son
my
life
my
joy
my
food
my
all
the
world
my
widowcomfort
and
my
sorrows
cure
i
fear
some
outrage
and
ill
follow
her
theres
nothing
in
this
world
can
make
me
joy
life
is
as
tedious
as
a
twicetold
tale
vexing
the
dull
ear
of
a
drowsy
man
and
bitter
shame
hath
spoild
the
sweet
worlds
taste
that
it
yields
nought
but
shame
and
bitterness
before
the
curing
of
a
strong
disease
even
in
the
instant
of
repair
and
health
the
fit
is
strongest
evils
that
take
leave
on
their
departure
most
of
all
show
evil
what
have
you
lost
by
losing
of
this
day
all
days
of
glory
joy
and
happiness
if
you
had
won
it
certainly
you
had
no
no
when
fortune
means
to
men
most
good
she
looks
upon
them
with
a
threatening
eye
tis
strange
to
think
how
much
king
john
hath
lost
in
this
which
he
accounts
so
clearly
won
are
not
you
grievd
that
arthur
is
his
prisoner
as
heartily
as
he
is
glad
he
hath
him
your
mind
is
all
as
youthful
as
your
blood
now
hear
me
speak
with
a
prophetic
spirit
for
even
the
breath
of
what
i
mean
to
speak
shall
blow
each
dust
each
straw
each
little
rub
out
of
the
path
which
shall
directly
lead
thy
foot
to
englands
throne
and
therefore
mark
john
hath
seizd
arthur
and
it
cannot
be
that
whiles
warm
life
plays
in
that
infants
veins
the
misplacd
john
should
entertain
an
hour
one
minute
nay
one
quiet
breath
of
rest
a
sceptre
snatchd
with
an
unruly
hand
must
be
as
boisterously
maintaind
as
gaind
and
he
that
stands
upon
a
slippery
place
makes
nice
of
no
vile
hold
to
stay
him
up
that
john
may
stand
then
arthur
needs
must
fall
so
be
it
for
it
cannot
be
but
so
but
what
shall
i
gain
by
young
arthurs
fall
you
in
the
right
of
lady
blanch
your
wife
may
then
make
all
the
claim
that
arthur
did
and
lose
it
life
and
all
as
arthur
did
how
green
you
are
and
fresh
in
this
old
world
john
lays
you
plots
the
times
conspire
with
you
for
he
that
steeps
his
safety
in
true
blood
shall
find
but
bloody
safety
and
untrue
this
act
so
evilly
borne
shall
cool
the
hearts
of
all
his
people
and
freeze
up
their
zeal
that
none
so
small
advantage
shall
step
forth
to
check
his
reign
but
they
will
cherish
it
no
natural
exhalation
in
the
sky
no
scope
of
nature
no
distemperd
day
no
common
wind
no
customed
event
but
they
will
pluck
away
his
natural
cause
and
call
them
meteors
prodigies
and
signs
abortives
presages
and
tongues
of
heaven
plainly
denouncing
vengeance
upon
john
may
be
he
will
not
touch
young
arthurs
life
but
hold
himself
safe
in
his
prisonment
o
sir
when
he
shall
hear
of
your
approach
if
that
young
arthur
be
not
gone
already
even
at
that
news
he
dies
and
then
the
hearts
of
all
his
people
shall
revolt
from
him
and
kiss
the
lips
of
unacquainted
change
and
pick
strong
matter
of
revolt
and
wrath
out
of
the
bloody
fingers
ends
of
john
methinks
i
see
this
hurly
all
on
foot
and
o
what
better
matter
breeds
for
you
than
i
have
namd
the
bastard
faulconbridge
is
now
in
england
ransacking
the
church
offending
charity
if
but
a
dozen
french
were
there
in
arms
they
would
be
as
a
call
to
train
ten
thousand
english
to
their
side
or
as
a
little
snow
tumbled
about
anon
becomes
a
mountain
o
noble
dauphin
go
with
me
to
the
king
tis
wonderful
what
may
be
wrought
out
of
their
discontent
now
that
their
souls
are
topful
of
offence
for
england
go
i
will
whet
on
the
king
strong
reasons
make
strong
actions
let
us
go
if
you
say
ay
the
king
will
not
say
no
heat
me
these
irons
hot
and
look
thou

within
the
arras
when
i
strike
my
foot
upon
the
bosom
of
the
ground

forth
and
bind
the
boy
which
you
shall
find
with
me
fast
to
the
chair
be
heedful
hence
and
watch
i
hope
your
warrant
will
bear
out
the
deed
uncleanly
scruples
fear
not

look
tot
young
lad

forth
i
have
to
say
with
you
good

little
prince
having
so
great
a
title
to
be
more
prince
as
may
be
you
are
sad
indeed
i
have
been
merrier
mercy
on
me
methinks
nobody
should
be
sad
but
i
yet
i
remember
when
i
was
in
france
young
gentlemen
would
be
as
sad
as
night
only
for
wantonness
by
my
christendom
so
i
were
out
of
prison
and
kept
sheep
i
should
be
as
merry
as
the
day
is
long
and
so
i
would
be
here
but
that
i
doubt
my
uncle
practises
more
harm
to
me
he
is
afraid
of
me
and
i
of
him
is
it
my
fault
that
i
was
geffreys
son
no
indeed
ist
not
and
i
would
to
heaven
i
were
your
son
so
you
would
love
me
hubert
if
i
talk
to
him
with
his
innocent
prate
he
will
awake
my
mercy
which
lies
dead
therefore
i
will
be
sudden
and
dispatch
are
you
sick
hubert
you
look
pale
today
in
sooth
i
would
you
were
a
little
sick
that
i
might
sit
all
night
and
watch
with
you
i
warrant
i
love
you
more
than
you
do
me
his
words
do
take
possession
of
my
bosom
read
here
young
arthur
how
now
foolish
rheum
turning
dispiteous
torture
out
of
door
i
must
be
brief
lest
resolution
drop
out
at
mine
eyes
in
tender
womanish
tears
can
you
not
read
it
is
it
not
fair
writ
too
fairly
hubert
for
so
foul
effect
must
you
with
hot
irons
burn
out
both
mine
eyes
young
boy
i
must
and
will
you
and
i
will
have
you
the
heart
when
your
head
did
but
ache
i
knit
my
handkercher
about
your
brows
the
best
i
had
a
princess
wrought
it
me
and
i
did
never
ask
it
you
again
and
with
my
hand
at
midnight
held
your
head
and
like
the
watchful
minutes
to
the
hour
still
and
anon
cheerd
up
the
heavy
time
saying
what
lack
you
and
where
lies
your
grief
or
what
good
love
may
i
perform
for
you
many
a
poor
mans
son
would
have
lain
still
and
neer
have
spoke
a
loving
word
to
you
but
you
at
your
sickservice
had
a
prince
nay
you
may
think
my
love
was
crafty
love
and
call
it
cunning
do
an
if
you
will
if
heaven
be
pleasd
that
you
must
use
me
ill
why
then
you
must
will
you
put
out
mine
eyes
these
eyes
that
never
did
nor
never
shall
so
much
as
frown
on
you
i
have
sworn
to
do
it
and
with
hot
irons
must
i
burn
them
out
ah
none
but
in
this
iron
age
would
do
it
the
iron
of
itself
though
heat
redhot
approaching
near
these
eyes
would
drink
my
tears
and
quench
this
fiery
indignation
even
in
the
matter
of
mine
innocence
nay
after
that
consume
away
in
rust
but
for
containing
fire
to
harm
mine
eye
are
you
more
stubbornhard
than
hammerd
iron
an
if
an
angel
should
have
come
to
me
and
told
me

put
out
mine
eyes

to
lose
your

but
a
mote
in
yours
a
grain
a
dust
a
gnat
a
wandering
hair
any
annoyance
in
that
precious
sense
then
feeling
what
small
things
are
boisterous
there
your
vile
intent
must
needs
seem
horrible
is
this
your
promise
go
to
hold
your
tongue
hubert
the
utterance
of
a
brace
of
tongues
must
needs
want
pleading
for
a
pair
of
eyes
let
me
not
hold
my
tongue
let
me
not
hubert
or
hubert
if
you
will
cut
out
my
tongue
so
i
may
keep
mine
eyes
o
spare
mine
eyes
though
to
no
use
but
still
to
look
on
you
lo
by
my
troth
the
instrument
is
cold
and
would
not
harm
me
i
can
heat
it
boy
no
in
good
sooth
the
fire
is
dead
with
grief
being
create
for
comfort
to
be
usd
in
undeservd
extremes
see
else
yourself
there
is
no
malice
in
this
burning
coal
the
breath
of
heaven
hath
blown
his
spirit
out
and
strewd
repentant
ashes
on
his
head
but
with
my
breath
i
can
revive
it
boy
an
if
you
do
you
will
but
make
it
blush
and
glow
with
shame
of
your
proceedings
hubert
nay
it
perchance
will
sparkle
in
your
eyes
and
like
a
dog
that
is
compelld
to
fight
snatch
at
his
master
that
doth
tarre
him
on
all
things
that
you
should
use
to
do
me
wrong
deny
their
office
only
you
do
lack
that
mercy
which
fierce
fire
and
iron
extends
creatures
of
note
for
mercylacking
uses
well
see
to
live
i
will
not
touch
thine
eyes
for
all
the
treasure
that
thine
uncle
owes
yet
am
i
sworn
and
i
did
purpose
boy
with
this
same
very
iron
to
burn
them
out
o
now
you
look
like
hubert
all
this
while
you
were
disguised
peace
no
more
adieu
your
uncle
must
not
know
but
you
are
dead
ill
fill
these
dogged
spies
with
false
reports
and
pretty
child
sleep
doubtless
and
secure
that
hubert
for
the
wealth
of
all
the
world
will
not
offend
thee
o
heaven
i
thank
you
hubert
silence
no
more
go
closely
in
with
me
much
danger
do
i
undergo
for
thee
here
once
again
we
sit
once
again
crownd
and
lookd
upon
i
hope
with
cheerful
eyes
this
once
again
but
that
your
highness
pleasd
was
once
superfluous
you
were
crownd
before
and
that
high
royalty
was
neer
pluckd
off
the
faiths
of
men
neer
stained
with
revolt
fresh
expectation
troubled
not
the
land
with
any
longdfor
change
or
better
state
therefore
to
be
possessd
with
double
pomp
to
guard
a
title
that
was
rich
before
to
gild
refined
gold
to
paint
the
lily
to
throw
a
perfume
on
the
violet
to
smooth
the
ice
or
add
another
hue
unto
the
rainbow
or
with
taperlight
to
seek
the
beauteous
eye
of
heaven
to
garnish
is
wasteful
and
ridiculous
excess
but
that
your
royal
pleasure
must
be
done
this
act
is
as
an
ancient
tale
new
told
and
in
the
last
repeating
troublesome
being
urged
at
a
time
unseasonable
in
this
the
antique
and
wellnoted
face
of
plain
old
form
is
much
disfigured
and
like
a
shifted
wind
unto
a
sail
it
makes
the
course
of
thoughts
to
fetch
about
startles
and
frights
consideration
makes
sound
opinion
sick
and
truth
suspected
for
putting
on
so
new
a
fashiond
robe
when
workmen
strive
to
do
better
than
well
they
do
confound
their
skill
in
covetousness
and
oftentimes
excusing
of
a
fault
doth
make
the
fault
the
worse
by
the
excuse
as
patches
set
upon
a
little
breach
discredit
more
in
hiding
of
the
fault
than
did
the
fault
before
it
was
so
patchd
to
this
effect
before
you
were
newcrownd
we
breathd
our
counsel
but
it
pleasd
your
highness
to
overbear
it
and
we
are
all
well
pleasd
since
all
and
every
part
of
what
we
would
doth
make
a
stand
at
what
your
highness
will
some
reasons
of
this
double
coronation
i
have
possessd
you
with
and
think
them
strong
and
more
more
strong
when
lesser
is
my
fear
i
shall
indue
you
with
meantime
but
ask
what
you
would
have
reformd
that
is
not
well
and
well
shall
you
perceive
how
willingly
i
will
both
hear
and
grant
you
your
requests
then
i
as
one
that
am
the
tongue
of
these
to
sound
the
purposes
of
all
their
hearts
both
for
myself
and
them
but
chief
of
all
your
safety
for
the
which
myself
and
them
bend
their
best
studies
heartily
request
the
enfranchisement
of
arthur
whose
restraint
doth
move
the
murmuring
lips
of
discontent
to
break
into
this
dangerous
argument
if
what
in
rest
you
have
in
right
you
hold
why
then
your
fears
which
as
they
say
attend
the
steps
of
wrong
should
move
you
to
mew
up
your
tender
kinsman
and
to
choke
his
days
with
barbarous
ignorance
and
deny
his
youth
the
rich
advantage
of
good
exercise
that
the
times
enemies
may
not
have
this
to
grace
occasions
let
it
be
our
suit
that
you
have
bid
us
ask
his
liberty
which
for
our
goods
we
do
no
further
ask
than
whereupon
our
weal
on
you
depending
counts
it
your
weal
he
have
his
liberty
let
it
be
so
i
do
commit
his
youth
to
your
direction
hubert
what
news
with
you
this
is
the
man
should
do
the
bloody
deed
he
showd
his
warrant
to
a
friend
of
mine
the
image
of
a
wicked
hemous
fault
lives
in
his
eye
that
close
aspect
of
his
does
show
the
mood
of
a
much
troubled
breast
and
i
do
fearfully
believe
tis
done
what
we
so
feard
he
had
a
charge
to
do
the
colour
of
the
king
doth
come
and
go
between
his
purpose
and
his
conscience
like
heralds
twixt
two
dreadful
battles
set
his
passion
is
so
ripe
it
needs
must
break
and
when
it
breaks
i
fear
will
issue
thence
the
foul
corruption
of
a
sweet
childs
death
we
cannot
hold
mortalitys
strong
hand
good
lords
although
my
will
to
give
is
living
the
suit
which
you
demand
is
gone
and
dead
he
tells
us
arthur
is
deceasd
tonight
indeed
we
feard
his
sickness
was
past
cure
indeed
we
heard
how
near
his
death
he
was
before
the
child
himself
felt
he
was
sick
this
must
be
answerd
either
here
or
hence
why
do
you
bend
such
solemn
brows
on
me
think
you
i
bear
the
shears
of
destiny
have
i
commandment
on
the
pulse
of
life
it
is
apparent
foul
play
and
tis
shame
that
greatness
should
so
grossly
offer
it
so
thrive
it
in
your
game
and
so
farewell
stay
yet
lord
salisbury
ill
go
with
thee
and
find
the
inheritance
of
this
poor
child
his
little
kingdom
of
a
forced
grave
that
blood
which
owd
the
breadth
of
all
this
isle
three
foot
of
it
doth
hold
bad
world
the
while
this
must
not
be
thus
borne
this
will
break
out
to
all
our
sorrows
and
ere
long
i
doubt
they
burn
in
indignation
i
repent
there
is
no
sure
foundation
set
on
blood
no
certain
life
achievd
by
others
death
a
fearful
eye
thou
hast
where
is
that
blood
that
i
have
seen
inhabit
in
those
cheeks
so
foul
a
sky
clears
not
without
a
storm
pour
down
thy
weather
how
goes
all
in
france
from
france
to
england
never
such
a
power
for
any
foreign
preparation
was
levied
in
the
body
of
a
land
the
copy
of
your
speed
is
learnd
by
them
for
when
you
should
be
told
they
do
prepare
the
tidings
come
that
they
are
all
arrivd
o
where
hath
our
intelligence
been
drunk
where
hath
it
slept
where
is
my
mothers
care
that
such
an
army
could
be
drawn
in
france
and
she
not
hear
of
it
my
liege
her
ear
is
stoppd
with
dust
the
first
of
april
died
your
noble
mother
and
as
i
hear
my
lord
the
lady
constance
in
a
frenzy
died
three
days
before
but
this
from
rumours
tongue
i
idly
heard
if
true
or
false
i
know
not
withhold
thy
speed
dreadful
occasion
o
make
a
league
with
me
till
i
have
pleasd
my
discontented
peers
what
mother
dead
how
wildly
then
walks
my
estate
in
france
under
whose
conduct
came
those
powers
of
france
that
thou
for
truth
givst
out
are
landed
here
under
the
dauphin
thou
hast
made
me
giddy
with
these
ill
tidings
now
what
says
the
world
to
your
proceedings
do
not
seek
to
stuff
my
head
with
more
ill
news
for
it
is
full
but
if
you
be
afeard
to
hear
the
worst
then
let
the
worst
unheard
fall
on
your
head
bear
with
me
cousin
for
i
was
amazd
under
the
tide
but
now
i
breathe
again
aloft
the
flood
and
can
give
audience
to
any
tongue
speak
it
of
what
it
will
how
i
have
sped
among
the
clergymen
the
sums
i
have
collected
shall
express
but
as
i
travelld
hither
through
the
land
i
find
the
people
strangely
fantasied
possessd
with
rumours
full
of
idle
dreams
not
knowing
what
they
fear
but
full
of
fear
and
heres
a
prophet
that
i
brought
with
me
from
forth
the
streets
of
pomfret
whom
i
found
with
many
hundreds
treading
on
his
heels
to
whom
he
sung
in
rude
harshsounding
rimes
that
ere
the
next
ascensionday
at
noon
your
highness
should
deliver
up
your
crown
thou
idle
dreamer
wherefore
didst
thou
so
foreknowing
that
the
truth
will
fall
out
so
hubert
away
with
him
imprison
him
and
on
that
day
at
noon
whereon
he
says
i
shall
yield
up
my
crown
let
him
be
hangd
deliver
him
to
safety
and
return
for
i
must
use
thee
o
my
gentle
cousin
hearst
thou
the
news
abroad
who
are
arrivd
the
french
my
lord
mens
mouths
are
full
of
it
besides
i
met
lord
bigot
and
lord
salisbury
with
eyes
as
red
as
newenkindled
fire
and
others
more
going
to
seek
the
grave
of
arthur
whom
they
say
is
killd
tonight
on
your
suggestion
gentle
kinsman
go
and
thrust
thyself
into
their
companies
i
have
a
way
to
win
their
loves
again
bring
them
before
me
i
will
seek
them
out
nay
but
make
haste
the
better
foot
before
o
let
me
have
no
subject
enemies
when
adverse
foreigners
affright
my
towns
with
dreadful
pomp
of
stout
invasion
be
mercury
set
feathers
to
thy
heels
and
fly
like
thought
from
them
to
me
again
the
spirit
of
the
time
shall
teach
me
speed
spoke
like
a
sprightful
noble
gentleman
go
after
him
for
he
perhaps
shall
need
some
messenger
betwixt
me
and
the
peers
and
be
thou
he
with
all
my
heart
my
liege
my
mother
dead
my
lord
they
say
five
moons
were
seen
tonight
four
fixed
and
the
fifth
did
whirl
about
the
other
four
in
wondrous
motion
five
moons
old
men
and
beldams
in
the
streets
do
prophesy
upon
it
dangerously
young
arthurs
death
is
common
in
their
mouths
and
when
they
talk
of
him
they
shake
their
heads
and
whisper
one
another
in
the
ear
and
he
that
speaks
doth
gripe
the
hearers
wrist
whilst
he
that
hears
makes
fearful
action
with
wrinkled
brows
with
nods
with
rolling
eyes
i
saw
a
smith
stand
with
his
hammer
thus
the
whilst
his
iron
did
on
the
anvil
cool
with
open
mouth
swallowing
a
tailors
news
who
with
his
shears
and
measure
in
his
hand
standing
on
slippers
which
his
nimble
haste
had
falsely
thrust
upon
contrary
feet
told
of
a
many
thousand
warlike
french
that
were
embattailed
and
rankd
in
kent
another
lean
unwashd
artificer
cuts
off
his
tale
and
talks
of
arthurs
death
why
seekst
thou
to
possess
me
with
these
fears
why
urgest
thou
so
oft
young
arthurs
death
thy
hand
hath
murderd
him
i
had
a
mighty
cause
to
wish
him
dead
but
thou
hadst
none
to
kill
him
no
had
my
lord
why
did
you
not
provoke
me
it
is
the
curse
of
kings
to
be
attended
by
slaves
that
take
their
humours
for
a
warrant
to
break
within
the
bloody
house
of
life
and
on
the
winking
of
authority
to
understand
a
law
to
know
the
meaning
of
dangerous
majesty
when
perchance
it
frowns
more
upon
humour
than
advisd
respect
here
is
your
hand
and
seal
for
what
i
did
o
when
the
last
account
twixt
heaven
and
earth
is
to
be
made
then
shall
this
hand
and
seal
witness
against
us
to
damnation
how
oft
the
sight
of
means
to
do
ill
deeds
makes
ill
deeds
done
hadst
not
thou
been
by
a
fellow
by
the
hand
of
nature
markd
quoted
and
signd
to
do
a
deed
of
shame
this
murder
had
not
come
into
my
mind
but
taking
note
of
thy
abhorrd
aspect
finding
thee
fit
for
bloody
villany
apt
liable
to
be
employd
in
danger
i
faintly
broke
with
thee
of
arthurs
death
and
thou
to
be
endeared
to
a
king
made
it
no
conscience
to
destroy
a
prince
my
lord
hadst
thou
but
shook
thy
head
or
made
a
pause
when
i
spake
darkly
what
i
purposed
or
turnd
an
eye
of
doubt
upon
my
face
as
bid
me
tell
my
tale
in
express
words
deep
shame
had
struck
me
dumb
made
me
break
off
and
those
thy
fears
might
have
wrought
fears
in
me
but
thou
didst
understand
me
by
my
signs
and
didst
in
signs
again
parley
with
sin
yea
without
stop
didst
let
thy
heart
consent
and
consequently
thy
rude
hand
to
act
the
deed
which
both
our
tongues
held
vile
to
name
out
of
my
sight
and
never
see
me
more
my
nobles
leave
me
and
my
state
is
bravd
even
at
my
gates
with
ranks
of
foreign
powers
nay
in
the
body
of
this
fleshly
land
this
kingdom
this
confine
of
blood
and
breath
hostility
and
civil
tumult
reigns
between
my
conscience
and
my
cousins
death
arm
you
against
your
other
enemies
ill
make
a
peace
between
your
soul
and
you
young
arthur
is
alive
this
hand
of
mine
is
yet
a
maiden
and
an
innocent
hand
not
painted
with
the
crimson
spots
of
blood
within
this
bosom
never
enterd
yet
the
dreadful
motion
of
a
murderous
thought
and
you
have
slanderd
nature
in
my
form
which
howsoever
rude
exteriorly
is
yet
the
cover
of
a
fairer
mind
than
to
be
butcher
of
an
innocent
child
doth
arthur
live
o
haste
thee
to
the
peers
throw
this
report
on
their
incensed
rage
and
make
them
tame
to
their
obedience
forgive
the
comment
that
my
passion
made
upon
thy
feature
for
my
rage
was
blind
and
foul
imaginary
eyes
of
blood
presented
thee
more
hideous
than
thou
art
o
answer
not
but
to
my
closet
bring
the
angry
lords
with
all
expedient
haste
i
conjure
thee
but
slowly
run
more
fast
the
wall
is
high
and
yet
will
i
leap
down
good
ground
be
pitiful
and
hurt
me
not
theres
few
or
none
do
know
me
if
they
did
this
shipboys
semblance
hath
disguisd
me
quite
i
am
afraid
and
yet
ill
venture
it
if
i
get
down
and
do
not
break
my
limbs
ill
find
a
thousand
shifts
to
get
away
as
good
to
die
and
go
as
die
and
stay
o
me
my
uncles

is
our
safety

we
must
embrace
this
gentle
offer
of
the
perilous
time
who
brought
that
letter
from
the
cardinal
the
count
melun
a
noble
lord
of
france
whose
private
with
me
of
the

is
much
more
general
than

hath
dispossessd
himself
of

we
will
not
line
his
thin
bestained
cloak
with
our
pure
honours
nor
attend
the
foot
that
leaves
the
print
of
blood
whereer
it
walks

and
tell
him
so
we
know
the
worst
whateer
you
think
good
words
i
think
were
best
our
griefs
and
not
our
manners

but
there
is
little

in
your
grief
therefore
twere

now
sir
sir

his
privilege
tis
true
to

his

no

this
is
the
prison
what
is
he
lies
here
o
death
made
proud
with
pure
and
princely
beauty
the
earth
had
not
a
hole
to
hide
this
deed
murder
as
hating
what
himself
hath
done
doth
lay
it
open
to
urge
on
revenge
or
when
he
doomd
this
beauty
to
a

found
it
too
preciousprincely
for
a

sir
richard
what

you

this
is
the
very
top
the
height
the
crest
or
crest
unto
the
crest
of
murders
arms
this
is
the
bloodiest
shame
the
wildest
savagery
the
vilest
stroke
that
ever
walleyed
wrath
or
staring
rage
presented
to
the
tears
of
soft
remorse
all
murders
past
do
stand
excusd
in
this
and
this
so
sole
and
so
unmatchable
shall
give
a
holiness
a
purity
to
the
yet
unbegotten
sin
of
times
and
prove
a
deadly
bloodshed
but
a
jest
exampled
by
this
heinous
spectacle
it
is
a
damned
and
a
bloody
work
the
graceless
action
of
a
heavy
hand
if
that
it
be
the
work
of
any
hand
if
that
it
be
the
work
of
any

we
had
a
kind
of
light
what
would
ensue
it
is
the
shameful
work
of
huberts
hand
the
practice
and
the
purpose
of
the
king
from
whose
obedience
i
forbid
my
soul
kneeling
before
this
ruin
of
sweet
life
and
breathing
to
his
breathless
excellence
the
incense
of
a
vow
a
holy
vow
never
to
taste
the
pleasures
of
the
world
never
to
be
infected
with
delight
nor
conversant
with
ease
and
idleness

for
villany

not
without
such
rheum
and
he
long
traded
in
it
makes
it
seem
like
rivers
of
remorse
and
innocency
away
with
me
all
you
whose
souls
abhor
the
uncleanly
savours
of
a
slaughterhouse

away
toward

and

hubert
do
but
hear
me
sir
ha
ill
tell
thee
what
thou
art
damnd
as
black
nay
nothing
is
so
black
thou
art
more
deep
damnd
than
prince
lucifer
there
is
not
yet
so
ugly
a
fiend
of
hell
as
thou
shalt
be
if
thou
didst
kill
this
child
upon
my
soul
if
thou
didst
but
consent
to
this
most
cruel
act
do
but
despair
and
if
thou
wantst
a
cord
the
smallest
thread
that
ever
spider
twisted
from
her
womb
will
serve
to
strangle
thee
a
rush
will
be
a
beam
to
hang
thee
on
or
wouldst
thou
drown
thyself
put
but
a
little
water
in
a
spoon
and
it
shall
be
as
all
the
ocean
enough
to
stifle
such
a
villain
up
i
do
suspect
thee
very
grievously
if
i
in
act
consent
or
sin
of
thought
be
guilty
of
the
stealing
that
sweet
breath
which
was
embounded
in
this
beauteous
clay
let
hell
want
pains
enough
to
torture
me
i
left
him
well
go
bear
him
in
thine
arms
i
am
amazd
methinks
and
lose
my
way
among
the
thorns
and
dangers
of
this
world
how
easy
dost
thou
take
all
england
up
from
forth
this
morsel
of
dead
royalty
the
life
the
right
and
truth
of
all
this
realm
is
fled
to
heaven
and
england
now
is
left
to
tug
and
scamble
and
to
part
by
the
teeth
the
unowd
interest
of
proud
swelling
state
now
for
the
barepickd
bone
of
majesty
doth
dogged
war
bristle
his
angry
crest
and
snarleth
in
the
gentle
eyes
of
peace
now
powers
from
home
and
discontents
at
home
meet
in
one
line
and
vast
confusion
waits
as
doth
a
raven
on
a
sickfallen
beast
the
imminent
decay
of
wrested
pomp
now
happy
he
whose
cloak
and
ceinture
can
hold
out
this
tempest
bear
away
that
child
and
follow
me
with
speed
ill
to
the
king
a
thousand
businesses
are
brief
in
hand
and
heaven
itself
doth
frown
upon
the
land
thus
have
i
yielded
up
into
your
hand
the
circle
of
my
glory
take
again
from
this
my
hand
as
holding
of
the
pope
your
sovereign
greatness
and
authority
now
keep
your
holy
word
go
meet
the
french
and
from
his
holiness
use
all
your
power
to
stop
their
marches
fore
we
are
inflamd
our
discontented
counties
do
revolt
our
people
quarrel
with
obedience
swearing
allegiance
and
the
love
of
soul
to
stranger
blood
to
foreign
royalty
this
inundation
of
mistemperd
humour
rests
by
you
only
to
be
qualified
then
pause
not
for
the
present
times
so
sick
that
present
medicine
must
be
ministerd
or
overthrow
incurable
ensues
it
was
my
breath
that
blew
this
tempest
up
upon
your
stubborn
usage
of
the
pope
but
since
you
are
a
gentle
convertite
my
tongue
shall
hush
again
this
storm
of
war
and
make
fair
weather
in
your
blustering
land
on
this
ascensionday
remember
well
upon
your
oath
of
service
to
the
pope
go
i
to
make
the
french
lay
down
their
arms
is
this
ascensionday
did
not
the
prophet
say
that
before
ascensionday
at
noon
my
crown
i
should
give
off
even
so
i
have
i
did
suppose
it
should
be
on
constraint
but
heaven
be
thankd
it
is
but
voluntary
all
kent
hath
yielded
nothing
there
holds
out
but
dover
castle
london
hath
receivd
like
a
kind
host
the
dauphin
and
his
powers
your
nobles
will
not
hear
you
but
are
gone
to
offer
service
to
your
enemy
and
wild
amazement
hurries
up
and
down
the
little
number
of
your
doubtful
friends
would
not
my
lords
return
to
me
again
after
they
heard
young
arthur
was
alive
they
found
him
dead
and
cast
into
the
streets
an
empty
casket
where
the
jewel
of
life
by
some
damnd
hand
was
robbd
and
taen
away
that
villain
hubert
told
me
he
did
live
so
on
my
soul
he
did
for
aught
he
knew
but
wherefore
do
you
droop
why
look
you
sad
be
great
in
act
as
you
have
been
in
thought
let
not
the
world
see
fear
and
sad
distrust
govern
the
motion
of
a
kingly
eye
be
stirring
as
the
time
be
fire
with
fire
threaten
the
threatener
and
outface
the
brow
of
bragging
horror
so
shall
inferior
eyes
that
borrow
their
behaviours
from
the
great
grow
great
by
your
example
and
put
on
the
dauntless
spirit
of
resolution
away
and
glister
like
the
god
of
war
when
he
intendeth
to
become
the
field
show
boldness
and
aspiring
confidence
what
shall
they
seek
the
lion
in
his
den
and
fright
him
there
and
make
him
tremble
there
o
let
it
not
be
said
forage
and
run
to
meet
displeasure
further
from
the
doors
and
grapple
with
him
ere
he
comes
so
nigh
the
legate
of
the
pope
hath
been
with
me
and
i
have
made
a
happy
peace
with
him
and
he
hath
promisd
to
dismiss
the
powers
led
by
the
dauphin
o
inglorious
league
shall
we
upon
the
footing
of
our
land
send
fairplay
orders
and
make
compromise
insinuation
parley
and
base
truce
to
arms
invasive
shall
a
beardless
boy
a
cockerd
silken
wanton
brave
our
fields
and
flesh
his
spirit
in
a
warlike
soul
mocking
the
air
with
colours
idly
spread
and
find
no
check
let
us
my
liege
to
arms
perchance
the
cardinal
cannot
make
your
peace
or
if
he
do
let
it
at
least
be
said
they
saw
we
had
a
purpose
of
defence
have
thou
the
ordering
of
this
present
time
away
then
with
good
courage
yet
i
know
our
party
may
well
meet
a
prouder
foe
my
lord
melun
let
this
be
copied
out
and
keep
it
safe
for
our
remembrance
return
the
precedent
to
these
lords
again
that
having
our
fair
order
written
down
both
they
and
we
perusing
oer
these
notes
may
know
wherefore
we
took
the
sacrament
and
keep
our
faiths
firm
and
inviolable
upon
our
sides
it
never
shall
be
broken
and
noble
dauphin
albeit
we
swear
a
voluntary
zeal
an
unurgd
faith
to
your
proceedings
yet
believe
me
prince
i
am
not
glad
that
such
a
sore
of
time
should
seek
a
plaster
by
contemnd
revolt
and
heal
the
inveterate
canker
of
one
wound
by
making
many
o
it
grieves
my
soul
that
i
must
draw
this
metal
from
my
side
to
be
a
widowmaker
o
and
there
where
honourable
rescue
and
defence
cries
out
upon
the
name
of
salisbury
but
such
is
the
infection
of
the
time
that
for
the
health
and
physic
of
our
right
we
cannot
deal
but
with
the
very
hand
of
stern
injustice
and
confused
wrong
and
ist
not
pity
o
my
grieved
friends
that
we
the
sons
and
children
of
this
isle
were
born
to
see
so
sad
an
hour
as
this
wherein
we
step
after
a
stranger
march
upon
her
gentle
bosom
and
fill
up
her
enemies
ranks
i
must
withdraw
and
weep
upon
the
spot
of
this
enforced
cause
to
grace
the
gentry
of
a
land
remote
and
follow
unacquainted
colours
here
what
here
o
nation
that
thou
couldst
remove
that
neptunes
arms
who
clippeth
thee
about
would
bear
thee
from
the
knowledge
of
thyself
and
gripple
thee
unto
a
pagan
shore
where
these
two
christian
armies
might
combine
the
blood
of
malice
in
a
vein
of
league
and
not
to
spend
it
so
unneighbourly
a
noble
temper
dost
thou
show
in
this
and
great
affections
wrestling
in
thy
bosom
do
make
an
earthquake
of
nobility
o
what
a
noble
combat
hast
thou
fought
between
compulsion
and
a
brave
respect
let
me
wipe
off
this
honourable
dew
that
silverly
doth
progress
on
thy
cheeks
my
heart
hath
melted
at
a
ladys
tears
being
an
ordinary
inundation
but
this
effusion
of
such
manly
drops
this
shower
blown
up
by
tempest
of
the
soul
startles
mine
eyes
and
makes
me
more
amazd
than
had
i
seen
the
vaulty
top
of
heaven
figurd
quite
oer
with
burning
meteors
lift
up
thy
brow
renowned
salisbury
and
with
a
great
heart
heave
away
this
storm
commend
these
waters
to
those
baby
eyes
that
never
saw
the
giant
world
enragd
nor
met
with
fortune
other
than
at
feasts
full
warm
of
blood
of
mirth
of
gossiping
come
come
for
thou
shalt
thrust
thy
hand
as
deep
into
the
purse
of
rich
prosperity
as
lewis
himself
so
nobles
shall
you
all
that
knit
your
sinews
to
the
strength
of
mine
and
even
there
methinks
an
angel
spake
look
where
the
holy
legate
comes
apace
to
give
us
warrant
from
the
hand
of
heaven
and
on
our
actions
set
the
name
of
right
with
holy
breath
hail
noble
prince

out
against
the
holy
church
the
great
metropolis
and
see
of
rome
therefore
thy
threatning
colours
now
wind
up
and
tame
the
savage
spirit
of
wild
war
that
like
a
lion
fosterd
up
at
hand
it
may
lie
gently
at
the
foot
of
peace
and
be
no
further
harmful
than

pardon
me

useful
servingman

to
any
sovereign
state
throughout
the
world
your
breath
first
kindled
the
dead
coal
of
wars
between
this
chastisd
kingdom
and
myself
and
brought
in
matter
that
should
feed
this
fire
and
now
tis
far
too
huge
to
be
blown
out
with
that
same
weak
wind
which
enkindled
it
you
taught
me
how
to
know
the
face
of
right
acquainted
me
with
interest
to
this
land

this
enterprise
into

the
best
cards

this
easy
match
playd
for
a
crown
and

i
now
give
oer
the
yielded
set
no
no
on
my
soul
it
never
shall
be
said
you
look
but
on
the
outside
of
this
work
outside
or
inside
i
will
not
return
till
my
attempt
so
much
be
glorified
as
to
my
ample
hope
was
promised
before
i
drew
this
gallant
head
of
war
and
culld
these
fiery
spirits
from
the
world
to
outlook
conquest
and
to
win
renown
even
in
the
jaws
of
danger
and
of
death
what
lusty
trumpet
thus
doth
summon
us
according
to
the
fair
play
of
the
world
let
me
have
audience
i
am
sent
to
speak
my
holy
lord
of
milan
from
the
king
i
come
to
learn
how
you
have
dealt
for
him
and
as
you
answer
i
do
know
the
scope
and
warrant
limited
unto
my
tongue
the
dauphin
is
too
wilfulopposite
and
will
not
temporize
with
my
entreaties
he
flatly
says
hell
not
lay
down
his
arms
by
all
the
blood
that
ever
fury
breathd
the
youth
says
well
now
hear
our
english
king
for
thus
his
royalty
doth
speak
in
me
he
is
prepard
and
reason
too
he
should
this
apish
and
unmannerly
approach
this
harnessd
masque
and
unadvised
revel
this
unhaird
sauciness
and
boyish
troops
the
king
doth
smile
at
and
is
well
prepard
to
whip
this
dwarfish
war
these
pigmy
arms
from
out
the
circle
of
his
territories
that
hand
which
had
the
strength
even
at
your
door
to
cudgel
you
and
make
you
take
the
hatch
to
dive
like
buckets
in
concealed
wells
to
crouch
in
litter
of
your
stable
planks
to
lie
like
pawns
lockd
up
in
chests
and
trunks
to
hug
with
swine
to
seek
sweet
safety
out
in
vaults
and
prisons
and
to
thrill
and
shake
even
at
the
crying
of
your
nations
crow
thinking
this
voice
an
armed
englishman
shall
that
victorious
hand
be
feebled
here
that
in
your
chambers
gave
you
chastisement
no
know
the
gallant
monarch
is
in
arms
and
like
an
eagle
oer
his
aiery
towers
to
souse
annoyance
that
comes
near
his
nest
and
you
degenerate
you
ingrate
revolts
you
bloody
neroes
ripping
up
the
womb
of
your
dear
mother
england
blush
for
shame
for
your
own
ladies
and
palevisagd
maids
like
amazons

tripping
after
drums
their
thimbles
into
armed
gauntlets
change
their
neelds
to
lances
and
their
gentle
hearts
to
fierce
and
bloody
inclination
there
end
thy
brave
and
turn
thy
face
in
peace
we
grant
thou
canst
outscold
us
fare
thee
well

hold
our
time
too
precious

will
attend
to
neither

for
our
interest

our
being
here

your
drums

beaten
will
cry
out
and
so
shall
you
being
beaten
do
but
start
an
echo
with
the
clamour
of
thy
drum
and
even
at
hand
a
drum
is
ready
bracd
that
shall
reverberate
all
as
loud
as
thine
sound

and
another

as
loud
as
thine
rattle

not
hideous
death
within

but
a
quantity
of
life
which
bleeds
away
even
as
a
form
of
wax
resolveth
from
his
figure
gainst
the
fire
what
in
the
world
should
make
me
now
deceive
since
i
must
lose
the
use
of
all
deceit
why
should
i
then
be
false
since
it
is
true
that
i
must
die
here
and
live
hence
by
truth
i
say
again
if
lewis
do
win
the
day
he
is
forsworn
if
eer
those
eyes
of
yours
behold
another
day
break
in
the
east
but
even
this
night
whose
black
contagious
breath
already
smokes
about
the
burning
crest
of
the
old
feeble
and
daywearied
sun
even
this
ill
night
your
breathing
shall
expire
paying
the
fine
of
rated
treachery
even
with
a
treacherous
fine
of
all
your
lives
if
lewis
by
your
assistance
win
the
day
commend
me
to
one
hubert
with
your
king
the
love
of
him
and
this
respect
besides
for
that
my
grandsire
was
an
englishman
awakes
my
conscience
to
confess
all
this
in
lieu
whereof
i
pray
you
bear
me
hence
from
forth
the
noise
and
rumour
of
the
field
where
i
may
think
the
remnant
of
my
thoughts
in
peace
and
part
this
body
and
my
soul
with
contemplation
and
devout
desires
we
do
believe
thee
and
beshrew
my
soul
but
i
do
love
the
favour
and
the
form
of
this
most
fair
occasion
by
the
which
we
will
untread
the
steps
of
damned
flight
and
like
a
bated
and
retired
flood
leaving
our
rankness
and
irregular
course
stoop
low
within
those
bounds
we
have
oerlookd
and
calmly
run
on
in
obedience
even
to
our
ocean
to
our
great
king
john
my
arm
shall
give
thee
help
to
bear
thee
hence
for
i
do
see
the
cruel
pangs
of
death
right
in
thine
eye
away
my
friends
new
flight
and
happy
newness
that
intends
old
right
the
sun
of
heaven
methought
was
loath
to
set
but
stayd
and
made
the
western
welkin
blush
when
the
english
measurd
backward
their
own
ground
in
faint
retire
o
bravely
came
we
off
when
with
a
volley
of
our
needless
shot
after
such
bloody
toil
we
bid
good
night
and
wound
our
tottering
colours
clearly
up
last
in
the
field
and
almost
lords
of
it
where
is
my
prince
the
dauphin

king
john
did
fly
an
hour
or
two

who
thou
wilt
and
if

i
in
the
black
brow
of
night
to
find
you
out

then
and
whats
the
news
o
my
sweet
sir
news
fitting
to
the
night

fearful
comfortless
and
horrible
show

the
very
wound
of
this
ill
news
i
am
no
woman
ill
not
swound
at
it
the
king
i
fear
is
poisond
by
a
monk
i
left
him
almost
speechless
and
broke
out
to
acquaint
you
with
this
evil
that
you
might
the
better
arm
you
to
the
sudden
time
than
if
you
had
at
leisure
known
of
this
how
did
he
take
it
who
did
taste
to
him
a
monk
i
tell
you
a
resolved
villain
whose
bowels
suddenly
burst
out
the
king
yet
speaks
and
peradventure
may
recover
whom
didst
thou
leave
to
tend
his
majesty
why
know
you
not
the
lords
are
all
come
back
and
brought
prince
henry
in
their
company
at
whose
request
the
king
hath
pardond
them
and
they
are
all
about
his
majesty
withhold
thine
indignation
mighty
heaven
and
tempt
us
not
to
bear
above
our
power
ill
tell
thee
hubert
half
my
power
this
night
passing
these
flats
are
taken
by
the
tide
these
lincoln
washes
have
devoured
them
myself
wellmounted
hardly
have
escapd
away
before
conduct
me
to
the
king
i
doubt
he
will
be
dead
or
ere
i
come
it
is
too
late
the
life
of
all
his
blood
is
touchd
corruptibly
and
his
pure
brain
which
some
suppose
the
souls
frail
dwellinghouse
doth
by
the
idle
comments
that
it
makes
foretell
the
ending
of
mortality
his
highness
yet
doth
speak
and
holds
belief
that
being
brought
into
the
open
air
it
would
allay
the
burning
quality
of
that
fell
poison
which
assaileth
him
let
him
be
brought
into
the
orchard
here
doth
he
still
rage
he
is
more
patient
than
when
you
left
him
even
now
he
sung
o
vanity
of
sickness
fierce
extremes
in
their
continuance
will
not
feel
themselves
death
having
preyd
upon
the
outward
parts
leaves
them
invisible
and
his
siege
is
now
against
the
mind
the
which
he
pricks
and
wounds
with
many
legions
of
strange
fantasies
which
in
their
throng
and
press
to
that
last
hold
confound
themselves
tis
strange
that
death
should
sing
i
am
the
cygnet
to
this
pale
faint
swan
who
chants
a
doleful
hymn
to
his
own
death
and
from
the
organpipe
of
frailty
sings
his
soul
and
body
to
their
lasting
rest
be
of
good
comfort
prince
for
you
are
born
to
set
a
form
upon
that
indigest
which
he
hath
left
so
shapeless
and
so
rude
ay
marry
now
my
soul
hath
elbowroom
it
would
not
out
at
windows
nor
at
doors
there
is
so
hot
a
summer
in
my
bosom
that
all
my
bowels
crumble
up
to
dust
i
am
a
scribbled
form
drawn
with
a
pen
upon
a
parchment
and
against
this
fire
do
i
shrink
up
how
fares
your
majesty
poisond
illfare
dead
forsook
cast
off
and
none
of
you
will
bid
the
winter
come
to
thrust
his
icy
fingers
in
my
maw
nor
let
my
kingdoms
rivers
take
their
course
through
my
burnd
bosom
nor
entreat
the
north
to
make
his
bleak
winds
kiss
my
parched
lips
and
comfort
me
with
cold
i
do
not
ask
you
much
i
beg
cold
comfort
and
you
are
so
strait
and
so
ingrateful
you
deny
me
that
o
that
there
were
some
virtue
in
my
tears
that
might
relieve
you
the
salt
in
them
is
hot
within
me
is
a
hell
and
there
the
poison
is
as
a
fiend
confind
to
tyrannize
on
unreprievable
condemned
blood
o
i
am
scalded
with
my
violent
motion
and
spleen
of
speed
to
see
your
majesty
o
cousin
thou
art
come
to
set
mine
eye
the
tackle
of
my
heart
is
crackd
and
burnd
and
all
the
shrouds
wherewith
my
life
should
sail
are
turned
to
one
thread
one
little
hair
my
heart
hath
one
poor
string
to
stay
it
by
which
holds
but
till
thy
news
be
uttered
and
then
all
this
thou
seest
is
but
a
clod
and
module
of
confounded
royalty
the
dauphin
is
preparing
hitherward
where
heaven
he
knows
how
we
shall
answer
him
for
in
a
night
the
best
part
of
my
power
as
i
upon
advantage
did
remove
were
in
the
washes
all
unwarily
devoured
by
the
unexpected
flood
you
breathe
these
dead
news
in
as
dead
an
ear
my
liege
my
lord
but
now
a
king
now
thus
even
so
must
i
run
on
and
even
so
stop
what
surety
of
the
world
what
hope
what
stay
when
this
was
now
a
king
and
now
is
clay
art
thou
gone
so
i
do
but
stay
behind
to
do
the
office
for
thee
of
revenge
and
then
my
soul
shall
wait
on
thee
to
heaven
as
it
on
earth
hath
been
thy
servant
still
now
now
you
stars
that
move
in
your
right
spheres
where
be
your
powers
show
now
your
mended
faiths
and
instantly
return
with
me
again
to
push
destruction
and
perpetual
shame
out
of
the
weak
door
of
our
fainting
land
straight
let
us
seek
or
straight
we
shall
be
sought
the
dauphin
rages
at
our
very
heels
it
seems
you
know
not
then
so
much
as
we
the
cardinal
pandulph
is
within
at
rest
who
half
an
hour
since
came
from
the
dauphin
and
brings
from
him
such
offers
of
our
peace
as
we
with
honour
and
respect
may
take
with
purpose
presently
to
leave
this
war
he
will
the
rather
do
it
when
he
sees
ourselves
well
sinewed
to
our
defence
nay
it
is
in
a
manner
done
already
for
many
carriages
he
hath
dispatchd
to
the
seaside
and
put
his
cause
and
quarrel
to
the
disposing
of
the
cardinal
with
whom
yourself
myself
and
other
lords
if
you
think
meet
this
afternoon
will
post
to
consummate
this
business
happily
let
it
be
so
and
you
my
noble
prince
with
other
princes
that
may
best
be
spard
shall
wait
upon
your
fathers
funeral
at
worcester
must
his
body
be
interrd
for
so
he
willd
it
thither
shall
it
then
and
happily
may
your
sweet
self
put
on
the
lineal
state
and
glory
of
the
land
to
whom
with
all
submission
on
my
knee
i
do
bequeath
my
faithful
services
and
true
subjection
everlastingly
and
the
like
tender
of
our
love
we
make
to
rest
without
a
spot
for
evermore
i
have
a
kind
soul
that
would
give
you
thanks
and
knows
not
how
to
do
it
but
with
tears
o
let
us
pay
the
time
but
needful
woe
since
it
hath
been
beforehand
with
our
griefs
this
england
never
did
nor
never
shall
lie
at
the
proud
foot
of
a
conqueror
but
when
it
first
did
help
to
wound
itself
now
these
her
princes
are
come
home
again
come
the
three
corners
of
the
world
in
arms
and
we
shall
shock
them
nought
shall
make
us
rue
if
england
to
itself
do
rest
but
true
the
life
of
king
henry

ascend
the
brightest
heaven
of
invention
a

princes

act

all

that
you

to
this

who
prologuelike
your
humble
patience
pray
gently
to
hear
kindly
to
judge
our
play
my
lord
ill
tell
you
that
self
bill
is
urgd
which
in
th
eleventh
year
of
the
last
kings
reign
was
like
and
had
indeed
against
us
passd
but
that
the
scambling
and
unquiet
time
did
push
it
out
of
further
question
but
how
my
lord
shall
we
resist
it
now
it
must
be
thought
on
if
it
pass
against
us
we
lose
the
better
half
of
our
possession
for
all
the
temporal
lands
which
men
devout
by
testament
have
given
to
the
church
would
they
strip
from
us
being
valud
thus
as
much
as
would
maintain
to
the
kings
honour
full
fifteen
earls
and
fifteen
hundred
knights
six
thousand
and
two
hundred
good
esquires
and
to
relief
of
lazars
and
weak
age
of
indigent
faint
souls
past
corporal
toil
a
hundred
almshouses
right
well
supplied
and
to
the
coffers
of
the
king
beside
a
thousand
pounds
by
the
year
thus
runs
the
bill
this
would
drink
deep
twould
drink
the
cup
and
all
but
what
prevention
the
king
is
full
of
grace
and
fair
regard
and
a
true
lover
of
the
holy
church
the
courses
of
his
youth
promisd
it
not
the
breath
no
sooner
left
his
fathers
body
but
that
his
wildness
mortified
in
him
seemd
to
die
too
yea
at
that
very
moment
consideration
like
an
angel
came
and
whippd
the
offending
adam
out
of
him
leaving
his
body
as
a
paradise
to
envelop
and
contain
celestial
spirits
never
was
such
a
sudden
scholar
made
never
came
reformation
in
a
flood
with
such
a
heady
currance
scouring
faults
nor
never
hydraheaded
wilfulness
so
soon
did
lose
his
seat
and
all
at
once
as
in
this
king
we
are
blessed
in
the
change
hear
him
but
reason
in
divinity
and
alladmiring
with
an
inward
wish
you
would
desire
the
king
were
made
a
prelate
hear
him
debate
of
commonwealth
affairs
you
would
say
it
hath
been
all
in
all
his
study
list
his
discourse
of
war
and
you
shall
hear
a
fearful
battle
renderd
you
in
music
turn
him
to
any
cause
of
policy
the
gordian
knot
of
it
he
will
unloose
familiar
as
his
garter
that
when
he
speaks
the
air
a
charterd
libertine
is
still
and
the
mute
wonder
lurketh
in
mens
ears
to
steal
his
sweet
and
honeyd
sentences
so
that
the
art
and
practic
part
of
life
must
be
the
mistress
to
this
theoric
which
is
a
wonder
how
his
grace
should
glean
it
since
his
addiction
was
to
courses
vain
his
companies
unletterd
rude
and
shallow
his
hours
filld
up
with
riots
banquets
sports
and
never
noted
in
him
any
study
any
retirement
any
sequestration
from
open
haunts
and
popularity
the
strawberry
grows
underneath
the
nettle
and
wholesome
berries
thrive
and
ripen
best
neighbourd
by
fruit
of
baser
quality
and
so
the
prince
obscurd
his
contemplation
under
the
veil
of
wildness
which
no
doubt
grew
like
the
summer
grass
fastest
by
night
unseen
yet
crescive
in
his
faculty
it
must
be
so
for
miracles
are
ceasd
and
therefore
we
must
needs
admit
the
means
how
things
are
perfected
but
my
good
lord
how
now
for
mitigation
of
this
bill
urgd
by
the
commons
doth
his
majesty
incline
to
it
or
no
he
seems
indifferent
or
rather
swaying
more
upon
our
part
than
cherishing
the
exhibiters
against
us
for
i
have
made
an
offer
to
his
majesty
upon
our
spiritual
convocation
and
in
regard
of
causes
now
in
hand
which
i
have
opend
to
his
grace
at
large
as
touching
france
to
give
a
greater
sum
than
ever
at
one
time
the
clergy
yet
did
to
his
predecessors
part
withal
how
did
this
offer
seem
receivd
my
lord
with
good
acceptance
of
his
majesty
save
that
there
was
not
time
enough
to
hear
as
i
perceivd
his
grace
would
fain
have
done
the
severals
and
unhidden
passages
of
his
true
titles
to
some
certain
dukedoms
and
generally
to
the
crown
and
seat
of
france
derivd
from
edward
his
greatgrandfather
what
was
the
impediment
that
broke
this
off
the
french
ambassador
upon
that
instant
cravd
audience
and
the
hour
i
think
is
come
to
give
him
hearing
is
it
four
oclock
it
is
then
go
we
in
to
know
his
embassy
which
i
could
with
a
ready
guess
declare
before
the
frenchman
speak
a
word
of
it
ill
wait
upon
you
and
i
long
to
hear
it
where
is
my
gracious
lord
of
canterbury
not
here
in
presence
send
for
him
good
uncle
shall
we
call
in
the
ambassador
my
liege
not
yet
my
cousin
we
would
be
resolvd
before
we
hear
him
of
some
things
of
weight
that
task
our
thoughts
concerning
us
and
france
god
and
his
angels
guard
your
sacred
throne
and
make
you
long
become
it
sure
we
thank
you
my
learned
lord
we
pray
you
to
proceed
and
justly
and
religiously
unfold
why
the
law
salique
that
they
have
in
france
or
should
or
should
not
bar
us
in
our
claim
and
god
forbid
my
dear
and
faithful
lord
that
you
should
fashion
wrest
or
bow
your
reading
or
nicely
charge
your
understanding
soul
with
opening
titles
miscreate
whose
right
suits
not
in
native
colours
with
the
truth
for
god
doth
know
how
many
now
in
health
shall
drop
their
blood
in
approbation
of
what
your
reverence
shall
incite
us
to
therefore
take
heed
how
you
impawn
our
person
how
you
awake
the
sleeping
sword
of
war
we
charge
you
in
the
name
of
god
take
heed
for
never
two
such
kingdoms
did
contend
without
much
fall
of
blood
whose
guiltless
drops
are
every
one
a
woe
a
sore
complaint
gainst
him
whose
wrongs
give
edge
unto
the
swords
that
make
such
waste
in
brief
mortality
under
this
conjuration
speak
my
lord
and
we
will
hear
note
and
believe
in
heart
that
what
you
speak
is
in
your
conscience
washd
as
pure
as
sin
with
baptism
then
hear
me
gracious
sovereign
and
you
peers
that
owe
yourselves
your
lives
and
services
to
this
imperial
throne
there
is
no
bar
to
make
against
your
highness
claim
to
france
but
this
which
they
produce
from
pharamond
in
terram
salicam
mulieres
ne
succedant
no
woman
shall
succeed
in
salique
land
which
salique
land
the
french
unjustly
gloze
to
be
the
realm
of
france
and
pharamond
the
founder
of
this
law
and
female
bar
yet
their
own
authors
faithfully
affirm
that
the
land
salique
is
in
germany
between
the
floods
of
sala
and
of
elbe
where
charles
the
great
having
subdud
the
saxons
there
left
behind
and
settled
certain
french
who
holding
in
disdain
the
german
women
for
some
dishonest
manners
of
their
life
establishd
then
this
law
to
wit
no
female
should
be
inheritrix
in
salique
land
which
salique
as
i
said
twixt
elbe
and
sala
is
at
this
day
in
germany
calld
meisen
then
doth
it
well
appear
the
salique
law
was
not
devised
for
the
realm
of
france
nor
did
the
french
possess
the
salique
land
until
four
hundred
oneandtwenty
years
after
defunction
of
king
pharamond
idly
supposd
the
founder
of
this
law
who
died
within
the
year
of
our
redemption
four
hundred
twentysix
and
charles
the
great
subdud
the
saxons
and
did
seat
the
french
beyond
the
river
sala
in
the
year
eight
hundred
five
besides
their
writers
say
king
pepin
which
deposed
childeric
did
as
heir
general
being
descended
of
blithild
which
was
daughter
to
king
clothair
make
claim
and
title
to
the
crown
of
france
hugh
capet
also
who
usurpd
the
crown
of
charles
the
duke
of
loraine
sole
heir
male
of
the
true
line
and
stock
of
charles
the
great
to
find
his
title
with
some
shows
of
truth
though
in
pure
truth
it
was
corrupt
and
naught
conveyd
himself
as
heir
to
the
lady
lingare
daughter
to
charlemain
who
was
the
son
to
lewis
the
emperor
and
lewis
the
son
of
charles
the
great
also
king
lewis
the
tenth
who
was
sole
heir
to
the
usurper
capet
could
not
keep
quiet
in
his
conscience
wearing
the
crown
of
france
till
satisfied
that
fair
queen
isabel
his
grandmother
was
lineal
of
the
lady
ermengare
daughter
to
charles
the
aforesaid
duke
of
loraine
by
the
which
marriage
the
line
of
charles
the
great
was
reunited
to
the
crown
of
france
so
that
as
clear
as
is
the
summers
sun
king
pepins
title
and
hugh
capets
claim
king
lewis
his
satisfaction
all
appear
to
hold
in
right
and
title
of
the
female
so
do
the
kings
of
france
unto
this
day
howbeit
they
would
hold
up
this
salique
law
to
bar
your
highness
claiming
from
the
female
and
rather
choose
to
hide
them
in
a
net
than
amply
to
imbar
their
crooked
titles
usurpd
from
you
and
your
progenitors
may
i
with
right
and
conscience
make
this
claim
the
sin
upon
my
head
dread
sovereign
for
in
the
book
of
numbers
is
it
writ
when
the
son
dies
let
the
inheritance
descend
unto
the
daughter
gracious
lord
stand
for
your
own
unwind
your
bloody
flag
look
back
into
your
mighty
ancestors
go
my
dread
lord
to
your
greatgrandsires
tomb
from
whom
you
claim
invoke
his
warlike
spirit
and
your
greatuncles
edward
the
black
prince
who
on
the
french
ground
playd
a
tragedy
making
defeat
on
the
full
power
of
france
whiles
his
most
mighty
father
on
a
hill
stood
smiling
to
behold
his
lions
whelp
forage
in
blood
of
french
nobility
o
noble
english
that
could
entertain
with
half
their
forces
the
full
pride
of
france
and
let
another
half
stand
laughing
by
all
out
of
work
and
cold
for
action
awake
remembrance
of
these
valiant
dead
and
with
your
puissant
arm
renew
their
feats
you
are
their
heir
you
sit
upon
their
throne
the
blood
and
courage
that
renowned
them
runs
in
your
veins
and
my
thricepuissantliege
is
in
the
very
maymorn
of
his
youth
ripe
for
exploits
and
mighty
enterprises
your
brother
kings
and
monarchs
of
the
earth
do
all
expect
that
you
should
rouse
yourself
as
did
the
former
lions
of
your
blood
they
know
your
grace
hath
cause
and
means
and
might
so
hath
your
highness
never
king
of
england
had
nobles
richer
and
more
loyal
subjects
whose
hearts
have
left
their
bodies
here
in
england
and
lie
paviliond
in
the
fields
of
france
o
let
their
bodies
follow
my
dear
liege
with
blood
and
sword
and
fire
to
win
your
right
in
aid
whereof
we
of
the
spiritualty
will
raise
your
highness
such
a
mighty
sum
as
never
did
the
clergy
at
one
time
bring
in
to
any
of
your
ancestors
we
must
not
only
arm
to
invade
the
french
but
lay
down
our
proportions
to
defend
against
the
scot
who
will
make
road
upon
us
with
all
advantages
they
of
those
marches
gracious
sovereign
shall
be
a
wall
sufficient
to
defend
our
inland
from
the
pilfering
borderers
we
do
not
mean
the
coursing
snatchers
only
but
fear
the
main
intendment
of
the
scot
who
hath
been
still
a
giddy
neighbour
to
us
for
you
shall
read
that
my
greatgrandfather
never
went
with
his
forces
into
france
but
that
the
scot
on
his
unfurnishd
kingdom
came
pouring
like
the
tide
into
a
breach
with
ample
and
brim
fulness
of
his
force
galling
the
gleaned
land
with
hot
essays
girding
with
grievous
siege
castles
and
towns
that
england
being
empty
of
defence
hath
shook
and
trembled
at
the
ill
neighbourhood
she
hath
been
then
more
feard
than
harmd
my
liege
for
hear
her
but
exampled
by
herself
when
all
her
chivalry
hath
been
in
france
and
she
a
mourning
widow
of
her
nobles
she
hath
herself
not
only
well
defended
but
taken
and
impounded
as
a
stray
the
king
of
scots
whom
she
did
send
to
france
to
fill
king
edwards
fame
with
prisoner
kings
and
make
your
chronicle
as
rich
with
praise
as
is
the
owse
and
bottom
of
the
sea
with
sunken
wrack
and
sumless
treasuries
but
theres
a
saying
very
old
and
true
if
that
you
will
france
win
then
with
scotland
first
begin
for
once
the
eagle
england
being
in
prey
to
her
unguarded
nest
the
weasel
scot
comes
sneaking
and
so
sucks
her
princely
eggs
playing
the
mouse
in
absence
of
the
cat
to
tear
and
havoc
more
than
she
can
eat
it
follows
then
the
cat
must
stay
at
home
yet
that
is
but
a
crushd
necessity
since
we
have
locks
to
safeguard
necessaries
and
pretty
traps
to
catch
the
petty
thieves
while
that
the
armed
hand
doth
fight
abroad
the
advised
head
defends
itself
at
home
for
government
though
high
and
low
and
lower
put
into
parts
doth
keep
in
one
consent
congreeing
in
a
full
and
natural
close
like
music
therefore
doth
heaven
divide
the
state
of
man
in
divers
functions
setting
endeavour
in
continual
motion
to
which
is
fixed
as
an
aim
or
butt
obedience
for
so
work
the
honeybees
creatures
that
by
a
rule
in
nature
teach
the
act
of
order
to
a
peopled
kingdom
they
have
a
king
and
officers
of
sorts
where
some
like
magistrates
correct
at
home
others
like
merchants
venture
trade
abroad
others
like
soldiers
armed
in
their
stings
make
boot
upon
the
summers
velvet
buds
which
pillage
they
with
merry
march
bring
home
to
the
tentroyal
of
their
emperor
who
busied
in
his
majesty
surveys
the
singing
masons
building
roofs
of
gold
the
civil
citizens
kneading
up
the
honey
the
poor
mechanic
porters
crowding
in
their
heavy
burdens
at
his
narrow
gate
the
sadeyd
justice
with
his
surly
hum
delivering
oer
to
executors
pale
the
lazy
yawning
drone
i
this
infer
that
many
things
having
full
reference
to
one
consent
may
work
contrariously
as
many
arrows
loosed
several
ways
fly
to
one
mark
as
many
ways
meet
in
one
town
as
many
fresh
streams
meet
in
one
salt
sea
as
many
lines
close
in
the
dials
centre
so
may
a
thousand
actions
once
afoot
end
in
one
purpose
and
be
all
well
borne
without
defeat
therefore
to
france
my
liege
divide
your
happy
england
into
four
whereof
take
you
one
quarter
into
france
and
you
withal
shall
make
all
gallia
shake
if
we
with
thrice
such
powers
left
at
home
cannot
defend
our
own
doors
from
the
dog
let
us
be
worried
and
our
nation
lose
the
name
of
hardiness
and
policy
call
in
the
messengers
sent
from
the
dauphin
now
are
we
well
resolvd
and
by
gods
help
and
yours
the
noble
sinews
of
our
power
france
being
ours
well
bend
it
to
our
awe
or
break
it
all
to
pieces
or
there
well
sit
ruling
in
large
and
ample
empery
oer
france
and
all
her
almost
kingly
dukedoms
or
lay
these
bones
in
an
unworthy
urn
tombless
with
no
remembrance
over
them
either
our
history
shall
with
full
mouth
speak
freely
of
our
acts
or
else
our
grave
like
turkish
mute
shall
have
a
tongueless
mouth
not
worshippd
with
a
waxen
epitaph
now
are
we
well
prepard
to
know
the
pleasure
of
our
fair
cousin
dauphin
for
we
hear
your
greeting
is
from
him
not
from
the
king
mayt
please
your
majesty
to
give
us
leave
freely
to
render
what
we
have
in
charge
or
shall
we
sparingly
show
you
far
off
the
dauphins
meaning
and
our
embassy
we
are
no
tyrant
but
a
christian
king
unto
whose
grace
our
passion
is
as
subject
as
are
our
wretches
fetterd
in
our
prisons
therefore
with
frank
and
with
uncurbed
plainness
tell
us
the
dauphins
mind
thus
then
in
few
your
highness
lately
sending
into
france
did
claim
some
certain
dukedoms
in
the
right
of
your
great
predecessor
king
edward
the
third
in
answer
of
which
claim
the
prince
our
master
says
that
you
savour
too
much
of
your
youth
and
bids
you
be
advisd
theres
nought
in
france
that
can
be
with
a
nimble
galliard
won
you
cannot
revel
into
dukedoms
there
he
therefore
sends
you
meeter
for
your
spirit
this
tun
of
treasure
and
in
lieu
of
this
desires
you
let
the
dukedoms
that
you
claim
hear
no
more
of
you
this
the
dauphin
speaks
what
treasure
uncle
tennisballs
my
liege
we
are
glad
the
dauphin
is
so
pleasant
with
us
his
present
and
your
pains
we
thank
you
for
when
we
have
matchd
our
rackets
to
these
balls
we
will
in
france
by
gods
grace
play
a
set
shall
strike
his
fathers
crown
into
the
hazard
tell
him
he
hath
made
a
match
with
such
a
wrangler
that
all
the
courts
of
france
will
be
disturbd
with
chaces
and
we
understand
him
well
how
he
comes
oer
us
with
our
wilder
days
not
measuring
what
use
we
made
of
them
we
never
valud
this
poor
seat
of
england
and
therefore
living
hence
did
give
ourself
to
barbarous
licence
as
tis
ever
common
that
men
are
merriest
when
they
are
from
home
but
tell
the
dauphin
i
will
keep
my
state
be
like
a
king
and
show
my
sail
of
greatness
when
i
do
rouse
me
in
my
throne
of
france
for
that
i
have
laid
by
my
majesty
and
plodded
like
a
man
for
workingdays
but
i
will
rise
there
with
so
full
a
glory
that
i
will
dazzle
all
the
eyes
of
france
yea
strike
the
dauphin
blind
to
look
on
us
and
tell
the
pleasant
prince
this
mock
of
his
hath
turnd
his
balls
to
gunstones
and
his
soul
shall
stand
sorecharged
for
the
wasteful
vengeance
that
shall
fly
with
them
for
many
a
thousand
widows
shall
this
his
mock
mock
out
of
their
dear
husbands
mock
mothers
from
their
sons
mock
castles
down
and
some
are
yet
ungotten
and
unborn
that
shall
have
cause
to
curse
the
dauphins
scorn
but
this
lies
all
within
the
will
of
god
to
whom
i
do
appeal
and
in
whose
name
tell
you
the
dauphin
i
am
coming
on
to
venge
me
as
i
may
and
to
put
forth
my
rightful
hand
in
a
wellhallowd
cause
so
get
you
hence
in
peace
and
tell
the
dauphin
his
jest
will
savour
but
of
shallow
wit
when
thousands
weep
more
than
did
laugh
at
it
convey
them
with
safe
conduct
fare
you
well
this
was
a
merry
message
we
hope
to
make
the
sender
blush
at
it
therefore
my
lords
omit
no
happy
hour
that
may
give
furtherance
to
our
expedition
for
we
have
now
no
thought
in
us
but
france
save
those
to
god
that
run
before
our
business
therefore
let
our
proportions
for
these
wars
be
soon
collected
and
all
things
thought
upon
that
may
with
reasonable
swiftness
add
more
feathers
to
our
wings
for
god
before
well
chide
this
dauphin
at
his
fathers
door
therefore
let
every
man
now
task
his
thought
that
this
fair
action
may
on
foot
be
brought
now
all
the
youth
of
england
are
on
fire
and
silken
dalliance
in
the
wardrobe
lies
now
thrive
the
armourers
and
honours
thought
reigns
solely
in
the
breast
of
every
man
they
sell
the
pasture
now
to
buy
the
horse
following
the
mirror
of
all
christian
kings
with
winged
heels
as
english
mercuries
for
now
sits
expectation
in
the
air
and
hides
a
sword
from
hilts
unto
the
point
with
crowns
imperial
crowns
and
coronets
promisd
to
harry
and
his
followers
the
french
advisd
by
good
intelligence
of
this
most
dreadful
preparation
shake
in
their
fear
and
with
pale
policy
seek
to
divert
the
english
purposes
o
england
model
to
thy
inward
greatness
like
little
body
with
a
mighty
heart
what
mightst
thou
do
that
honour
would
thee
do
were
all
thy
children
kind
and
natural
but
see
thy
fault
france
hath
in
thee
found
out
a
nest
of
hollow
bosoms
which
he
fills
with
treacherous
crowns
and
three
corrupted
men
one
richard
earl
of
cambridge
and
the
second
henry
lord
scroop
of
masham
and
the
third
sir
thomas
grey
knight
of
northumberland
have
for
the
gilt
of
france
o
guilt
indeed
confirmd
conspiracy
with
fearful
france
and
by
their
hands
this
grace
of
kings
must
die
if
hell
and
treason
hold
their
promises
ere
he
take
ship
for
france
and
in
southampton
linger
your
patience
on
and
well
digest
the
abuse
of
distance
while
we
force
a
play
the
sum
is
paid
the
traitors
are
agreed
the
king
is
set
from
london
and
the
scene
is
now
transported
gentles
to
southampton
there
is
the
playhouse
now
there
must
you
sit
and
thence
to
france
shall
we
convey
you
safe
and
bring
you
back
charming
the
narrow
seas
to
give
you
gentle
pass
for
if
we
may
well
not
offend
one
stomach
with
our
play
but
till
the
king
come
forth
and
not
till
then
unto
southampton
do
we
shift
our
scene

as
it
may
i
dare
not
fight
but
i
will
wink
and
hold
out
mine
iron
it
is
a
simple
one
but
what
though
it
will
toast
cheese

sword
will
and

an
end
i
will
bestow

breakfast

my
rest

that
time
and

edges

be
as

live
fore
god
his
grace
is
bold
to
trust
these
traitors

shall
be
apprehended
by

by
how
smooth
and
even
they
do
bear
themselves
as
if
allegiance
in
their
bosoms
sat
crowned
with
faith
and
constant
loyalty
the
king
hath
note
of
all
that
they
intend
by
interception
which
they
dream
not
of
nay
but
the
man
that
was
his
bedfellow
whom
he
hath
dulld
and
cloyd
with
gracious
favours
that
he
should
for
a
foreign
purse
so
sell
his
sovereigns
life
to
death
and
treachery
now
sits
the
wind
fair
and
we
will
aboard
my
lord
of
cambridge
and
my
kind
lord
of
masham
and
you
my
gentle
knight
give
me
your
thoughts
think
you
not
that
the
powers
we
bear
with
us
will
cut
their
passage
through
the
force
of
france
doing
the
execution
and
the
act
for
which
we
have
in
head
assembled
them
no
doubt
my
liege
if
each
man
do
his
best
i
doubt
not
that
since
we
are
well
persuaded
we
carry
not
a
heart
with
us
from
hence
that
grows
not
in
a
fair
consent
with
ours
nor
leave
not
one
behind
that
doth
not
wish
success
and
conquest
to
attend
on
us
never
was
monarch
better
feard
and
lovd
than
is
your
majesty
theres
not
i
think
a
subject
that
sits
in
heartgrief
and
uneasiness
under
the
sweet
shade
of
your
government
true
those
that
were
your
fathers
enemies
have
steepd
their
galls
in
honey
and
do
serve
you
with
hearts
create
of
duty
and
of
zeal
we
therefore
have
great
cause
of
thankfulness
and
shall
forget
the
office
of
our
hand
sooner
than
quittance
of
desert
and
merit
according
to
the
weight
and
worthiness
so
service
shall
with
steeled
sinews
toil
and
labour
shall
refresh
itself
with
hope
to
do
your
grace
incessant
services
we
judge
no
less
uncle
of
exeter
enlarge
the
man
committed
yesterday
that
raild
against
our
person
we
consider
it
was
excess
of
wine
that
set
him
on
and
on
his
more
advice
we
pardon
him
thats
mercy
but
too
much
security
let
him
be
punishd
sovereign
lest
example
breed
by
his
sufference
more
of
such
a
kind
o
let
us
yet
be
merciful
so
may
your
highness
and
yet
punish
too
sir
you
show
great
mercy
if
you
give
him
life
after
the
taste
of
much
correction
alas
your
too
much
love
and
care
of
me
are
heavy
orisons
gainst
this
poor
wretch
if
little
faults
proceeding
on
distemper
shall
not
be
winkd
at
how
shall
we
stretch
our
eye
when
capital
crimes
chewd
swallowd
and
digested
appear
before
us
well
yet
enlarge
that
man
though
cambridge
scroop
and
grey
in
their
dear
care
and
tender
preservation
of
our
person
would
have
him
punishd
and
now
to
our
french
causes
who
are
the
late
commissioners
i
one
my
lord
your
highness
bade
me
ask
for
it
today

liege
and

my
royal
sovereign

richard
earl
of
cambridge

yours

and
sir

of
northumberland

same
is
yours

i
know
your
worthiness
my
lord
of
westmoreland
and
uncle
exeter
we
will
aboard
tonight
why
how
now
gentlemen
what
see
you
in
those
papers
that
you
lose
so
much
complexion
look
ye
how
they
change
their
cheeks
are
paper
why
what
read
you
there
that
hath
so
cowarded
and
chasd
your
blood
out
of
appearance
i
do
confess
my
fault
and
do
submit
me
to
your
highness
mercy
to
which
we
all
appeal
to
which
we
all
appeal
the
mercy
that
was
quick
in
us
but
late
by
your
own
counsel
is
suppressd
and
killd
you
must
not
dare
for
shame
to
talk
of
mercy
for
your
own
reasons
turn
into
your
bosoms
as
dogs
upon
their
masters
worrying
you
see
you
my
princes
and
my
noble
peers
these
english
monsters
my
lord
of
cambridge
here
you
know
how
apt
our
love
was
to
accord
to
furnish
him
with
all
appertinents
belonging
to
his
honour
and
this
man
hath
for
a
few
light
crowns
lightly
conspird
and
sworn
unto
the
practices
of
france
to
kill
us
here
in
hampton
to
the
which
this
knight
no
less
for
bounty
bound
to
us
than
cambridge
is
hath
likewise
sworn
but
o
what
shall
i
say
to
thee
lord
scroop
thou
cruel
ingrateful
savage
and
inhuman
creature
thou
that
didst
bear
the
key
of
all
my
counsels
that
knewst
the
very
bottom
of
my
soul
that
almost
mightst
have
coind
me
into
gold
wouldst
thou
have
practisd
on
me
for
thy
use
may
it
be
possible
that
foreign
hire
could
out
of
thee
extract
one
spark
of
evil
that
might
annoy
my
finger
tis
so
strange
that
though
the
truth
of
it
stands
off
as
gross
as
black
from
white
my
eye
will
scarcely
see
it
treason
and
murder
ever
kept
together
as
two
yokedevils
sworn
to
eithers
purpose
working
so
grossly
in
a
natural
cause
that
admiration
did
not
whoop
at
them
but
thou
gainst
all
proportion
didst
bring
in
wonder
to
wait
on
treason
and
on
murder
and
whatsoever
cunning
fiend
it
was
that
wrought
upon
thee
so
preposterously
hath
got
the
voice
in
hell
for
excellence
and
other
devils
that
suggest
by
treasons
do
botch
and
bungle
up
damnation
with
patches
colours
and
with
forms
being
fetchd
from
glistering
semblances
of
piety
but
he
that
temperd
thee
bade
thee
stand
up
gave
thee
no
instance
why
thou
shouldst
do
treason
unless
to
dub
thee
with
the
name
of
traitor
if
that
same
demon
that
hath
gulld
thee
thus
should
with
his
lion
gait
walk
the
whole
world
he
might
return
to
vasty
tartar
back
and
tell
the
legions
i
can
never
win
a
soul
so
easy
as
that
englishmans
o
how
hast
thou
with
jealousy
infected
the
sweetness
of
affiance
show
men
dutiful
why
so
didst
thou
seem
they
grave
and
learned
why
so
didst
thou
come
they
of
noble
family
why
so
didst
thou
seem
they
religious
why
so
didst
thou
or
are
they
spare
in
diet
free
from
gross
passion
or
of
mirth
or
anger
constant
in
spirit
not
swerving
with
the
blood
garnishd
and
deckd
in
modest
complement
not
working
with
the
eye
without
the
ear
and
but
in
purged
judgment
trusting
neither
such
and
so
finely
bolted
didst
thou
seem
and
thus
thy
fall
hath
left
a
kind
of
blot
to
mark
the
fullfraught
man
and
best
indud
with
some
suspicion
i
will
weep
for
thee
for
this
revolt
of
thine
methinks
is
like
another
fall
of
man
their
faults
are
open
arrest
them
to
the
answer
of
the
law
and
god
acquit
them
of
their
practices

arrest
thee
of
high

the
name
of
thomas
grey
knight
of
northumberland
our
purposes
god
justly
hath
discoverd
and
i
repent
my
fault
more
than
my
death
which
i
beseech
your
highness
to
forgive
although
my
body
pay
the
price
of
it
for
me
the
gold
of
france
did
not
seduce
although
i
did
admit
it
as
a
motive
the
sooner
to
effect
what
i
intended
but
god
be
thanked
for
prevention
which
i
in
sufference
heartily
will
rejoice
beseeching
god
and
you
to
pardon
me
never
did

dangerous

prevented
from
a
damned
enterprise

fault

sentence
you
have
conspird
against
our
royal
person
joind
with
an
enemy
proclaimd
and
from
his
coffers
receivd
the
golden
earnest
of
our
death
wherein
you
would
have
sold
your
king
to
slaughter
his
princes

peers
to
servitude

subjects
to
oppression
and
contempt
and
his
whole

had
been
any
christom
child
a
parted
even
just
between
twelve
and
one
even
at
the
turning
o
the
tide
for
after
i
saw
him
fumble
with
the
sheets
and
play
with
flowers
and
smile
upon
his
fingers
ends
i
knew
there
was
but
one
way
for
his
nose
was
as
sharp
as
a
pen
and
a
babbled
of
green
fields
how
now
sir
john
quoth
i
what
man
be
of
good
cheer
so
a
cried
out
god
god
god
three
or
four
times
now
i
to
comfort
him
bid
him
a
should
not
think
of
god
i
hoped
there
was
no
need
to
trouble
himself
with
any
such
thoughts
yet
so
a
bade
me
lay
more
clothes
on
his
feet
i
put
my
hand
into
the
bed
and
felt
them
and
they
were
as
cold
as
any
stone
then
i
felt
to
his
knees
and
so
upward
and
upward
and
all
was
as
cold
as
any
stone
they
say
he
cried
out
of
sack
ay
that
a
did
and
of
women
nay
that
a
did
not
yes
that
a
did
and
said
they
were
devils
incarnate
a
could
never
abide
carnation
twas
a
colour
he
never
liked
a
said
once
the
devil
would
have
him
about
women
a
did
in
some
sort
indeed
handle
women
but
then
he
was
rheumatic
and
talked
of
the
whore
of
babylon
do
you
not
remember
a
saw
a
flea
stick
upon
bardolphs
nose
and
a
said
it
was
a
black
soul
burning
in
hellfire
well
the
fuel
is
gone
that
maintained
that
fire
thats
all
the
riches
i
got
in
his
service
shall
we
shog
the
king
will
be
gone
from
southampton
come
lets
away
my
love
give
me
thy
lips
look
to
my
chattels
and
my
moveables
let
senses
rule
the
word
is
pitch
and
pay
trust
none
for
oaths
are
straws
mens
faiths
are
wafercakes
and
holdfast
is
the
only
dog
my
duck
therefore
caveto
be
thy
counsellor
go
clear
thy
crystals
yokefellows
in
arms
let
us
to
france
like
horseleeches
my
boys
to
suck
to
suck
the
very
blood
to
suck
and
thats
but
unwholesome
food
they
say
touch
her
soft
mouth
and
march
farewell
hostess
i
cannot
kiss
that
is
the
humour
of
it
but
adieu
let
housewifery
appear
keep
close
i
thee
command
farewell
adieu
thus
come
the
english
with
full
power
upon
us
and
more
than
carefully
it
us
concerns
to
answer
royally
in
our
defences
therefore
the
dukes
of
berri
and
britaine
of
brabant
and
of
orleans
shall
make
forth
and
you
prince
dauphin
with
all
swift
dispatch
to
line
and
new
repair
our
towns
of
war
with
men
of
courage
and
with
means
defendant
for
england
his
approaches
makes
as
fierce
as
waters
to
the
sucking
of
a
gulf
it
fits
us
then
to
be
as
provident
as
fear
may
teach
us
out
of
late
examples
left
by
the
fatal
and
neglected
english
upon
our
fields
my
most
redoubted
father
it
is
most
meet
we
arm
us
gainst
the
foe
for
peace
itself
should
not
so
dull
a
kingdom
though
war
nor
no
known
quarrel
were
in
question
but
that
defences
musters
preparations
should
be
maintaind
assembled
and
collected
as
were
a
war
in
expectation
therefore
i
say
tis
meet
we
all
go
forth
to
view
the
sick
and
feeble
parts
of
france
and
let
us
do
it
with
no
show
of
fear
no
with
no
more
than
if
we
heard
that
england
were
busied
with
a
whitsun
morrisdance
for
my
good
liege
she
is
so
idly
kingd
her
sceptre
so
fantastically
borne
by
a
vain
giddy
shallow
humorous
youth
that
fear
attends
her
not
o
peace
prince
dauphin
you
are
too
much
mistaken
in
this
king
question
your
grace
the
late
ambassadors
with
what
great
state
he
heard
their
embassy
how
well
supplied
with
noble
counsellors
how
modest
in
exception
and
withal
how
terrible
in
constant
resolution
and
you
shall
find
his
vanities
forespent
were
but
the
outside
of
the
roman
brutus
covering
discretion
with
a
coat
of
folly
as
gardeners
do
with
ordure
hide
those
roots
that
shall
first
spring
and
be
most
delicate
well
tis
not
so
my
lord
high
constable
but
though
we
think
it
so
it
is
no
matter
in
cases
of
defence
tis
best
to
weigh
the
enemy
more
mighty
than
he
seems
so
the
proportions
of
defence
are
filld
which
of
a
weak
and
niggardly
projection
doth
like
a
miser
spoil
his
coat
with
scanting
a
little
cloth
think
we
king
harry
strong
and
princes
look
you
strongly
arm
to
meet
him
the
kindred
of
him
hath
been
fleshd
upon
us
and
he
is
bred
out
of
that
bloody
strain
that
haunted
us
in
our
familiar
paths
witness
our
too
much
memorable
shame
when
cressy
battle
fatally
was
struck
and
all
our
princes
captivd
by
the
hand
of
that
black
name
edward
black
prince
of
wales
whiles
that
his
mounting
sire
on
mountain
standing
up
in
the
air
crownd
with
the
golden
sun
saw
his
heroical
seed
and
smild
to
see
him
mangle
the
work
of
nature
and
deface
the
patterns
that
by
god
and
by
french
fathers
had
twenty
years
been
made
this
is
a
stem
of
that
victorious
stock
and
let
us
fear
the
native
mightiness
and
fate
of
him
ambassadors
from
harry
king
of
england
do
crave
admittance
to
your
majesty
well
give
them
present
audience
go
and
bring
them
you
see
this
chase
is
hotly
followd
friends
turn
head
and
stop
pursuit
for
coward
dogs
most
spend
their
mouths
when
what
they
seem
to
threaten
runs
far
before
them
good
my
sovereign
take
up
the
english
short
and
let
them
know
of
what
a
monarchy
you
are
the
head
selflove
my
liege
is
not
so
vile
a
sin
as
selfneglecting
from
our
brother
england
from
him
and
thus
he
greets
your
majesty
he
wills
you
in
the
name
of
god
almighty
that
you
divest
yourself
and
lay
apart
the
borrowd
glories
that
by
gift
of
heaven
by
law
of
nature
and
of
nations
long
to
him
and
to
his
heirs
namely
the
crown
and
all
widestretched
honours
that
pertain
by
custom
and
the
ordinance
of
times
unto
the
crown
of
france
that
you
may
know
tis
no
sinister
nor
no
awkward
claim
pickd
from
the
wormholes
of
longvanishd
days
nor
from
the
dust
of
old
oblivion
rakd
he
sends
you
this
most
memorable
line
in
every
branch
truly
demonstrative
willing
you
overlook
this
pedigree
and
when
you
find
him
evenly
derivd
from
his
most
famd
of
famous
ancestors
edward
the
third
he
bids
you
then
resign
your
crown
and
kingdom
indirectly
held
from
him
the
native
and
true
challenger
or
else
what
follows
bloody
constraint
for
if
you
hide
the
crown
even
in
your
hearts
there
will
he
rake
for
it
therefore
in
fierce
tempest
is
he
coming
in
thunder
and
in
earthquake
like
a
jove
that
if
requiring
fail
he
will
compel
and
bids
you
in
the
bowels
of
the
lord
deliver
up
the
crown
and
to
take
mercy
on
the
poor
souls
for
whom
this
hungry
war
opens
his
vasty
jaws
and
on
your
head
turning
the
widows
tears
the
orphans
cries
the
dead
mens
blood
the
pining
maidens
groans
for
husbands
fathers
and
betrothed
lovers
that
shall
be
swallowd
in
this
controversy
this
is
his
claim
his
threatning
and
my
message
unless
the
dauphin
be
in
presence
here
to
whom
expressly
i
bring
greeting
too
for
us
we
will
consider
of
this
further
tomorrow
shall
you
bear
our
full
intent
back
to
our
brother
england
for
the
dauphin
i
stand
here
for
him
what
to
him
from
england
scorn
and
defiance
slight
regard
contempt
and
anything
that
may
not
misbecome
the
mighty
sender
doth
he
prize
you
at
thus
says
my
king
an
if
your
fathers
highness
do
not
in
grant
of
all
demands
at
large
sweeten
the
bitter
mock
you
sent
his
majesty
hell
call
you
to
so
hot
an
answer
of
it
that
caves
and
womby
vaultages
of
france
shall
chide
your
trespass
and
return
your
mock
in
second
accent
of
his
ordinance
say
if
my
father
render
fair
return
it
is
against
my
will
for
i
desire
nothing
but
odds
with
england
to
that
end
as
matching
to
his
youth
and
vanity
i
did
present
him
with
the
paris
balls
hell
make
your
paris
louvre
shake
for
it
were
it
the
mistresscourt
of
mighty
europe
and
be
assurd
youll
find
a
difference
as
we
his
subjects
have
in
wonder
found
between
the
promise
of
his
greener
days
and
these
he
masters
now
now
he
weighs
time
even
to
the
utmost
grain
that
you
shall
read
in
your
own
losses
if
he
stay
in
france
tomorrow
shall
you
know
our
mind
at
full
dispatch
us
with
all
speed
lest
that
our
king
come
here
himself
to
question
our
delay
for
he
is
footed
in
this
land
already
you
shall
be
soon
dispatchd
with
fair
conditions
a
night
is
but
small
breath
and
little
pause
to
answer
matters
of
this
consequence
thus
with
imagind
wing
our
swift
scene
flies
in
motion
of
no
less
celerity
than
that
of
thought
suppose
that
you
have
seen
the
wellappointed
king
at
hampton
pier
embark
his
royalty
and
his
brave
fleet
with
silken
streamers
the
young
ph
bus
fanning
play
with
your
fancies
and
in
them
behold
upon
the
hempen
tackle
shipboys
climbing
hear
the
shrill
whistle
which
doth
order
give
to
sounds
confusd
behold
the
threaden
sails
borne
with
the
invisible
and
creeping
wind
draw
the
huge
bottoms
through
the
furrowd
sea
breasting
the
lofty
surge
o
do
but
think
you
stand
upon
the
rivage
and
behold
a
city
on
the
inconstant
billows
dancing
for
so
appears
this
fleet
majestical
holding
due
course
to
harfleur
follow
follow
grapple
your
minds
to
sternage
of
this
navy
and
leave
your
england
as
dead
midnight
still
guarded
with
grandsires
babies
and
old
women
either
past
or
not
arrivd
to
pith
and
puissance
for
who
is
he
whose
chin
is
but
enrichd
with
one
appearing
hair
that
will
not
follow
those
calld
and
choicedrawn
cavaliers
to
france
work
work
your
thoughts
and
therein
see
a
siege
behold
the
ordenance
on
their
carriages
with
fatal
mouths
gaping
on
girded
harfleur
suppose
the
ambassador
from
the
french
comes
back
tells
harry
that
the
king
doth
offer
him
katharine
his
daughter
and
with
her
to
dowry
some
petty
and
unprofitable
dukedoms
the
offer
likes
not
and
the
nimble
gunner
with
linstock
now
the
devilish
cannon
touches
and
down
goes
all
before
them
still
be
kind
and
eke
out
our
performance
with
your
mind
once
more
unto
the
breach
dear
friends
once
more
or
close
the
wall
up
with
our
english
dead
in
peace
theres
nothing
so
becomes
a
man
as
modest
stillness
and
humility
but
when
the
blast
of
war
blows
in
our
ears
then
imitate
the
action
of
the
tiger
stiffen
the
sinews
summon
up
the
blood
disguise
fair
nature
with
hardfavourd
rage
then
lend
the
eye
a
terrible
aspect
let
it
pry
through
the
portage
of
the
head
like
the
brass
cannon
let
the
brow
oerwhelm
it
as
fearfully
as
doth
a
galled
rock
oerhang
and
jutty
his
confounded
base
swilld
with
the
wild
and
wasteful
ocean
now
set
the
teeth
and
stretch
the
nostril
wide
hold
hard
the
breath
and
bend
up
every
spirit
to
his
full
height
on
on
you
noblest
english
whose
blood
is
fet
from
fathers
of
warproof
fathers
that
like
so
many
alexanders
have
in
these
parts
from
morn
till
even
fought
and
sheathd
their
swords
for
lack
of
argument
dishonour
not
your
mothers
now
attest
that
those
whom
you
calld
fathers
did
beget
you
be
copy
now
to
men
of
grosser
blood
and
teach
them
how
to
war
and
you
good
yeomen
whose
limbs
were
made
in
england
show
us
here
the
mettle
of
your
pasture
let
us
swear
that
you
are
worth
your
breeding
which
i
doubt
not
for
there
is
none
of
you
so
mean
and
base
that
hath
not
noble
lustre
in
your
eyes
i
see
you
stand
like
greyhounds
in
the
slips
straining
upon
the
start
the
games
afoot
follow
your
spirit
and
upon
this
charge
cry
god
for
harry
england
and
saint
george
on

to
the
breach
to
the

pray
thee
corporal
stay
the
knocks
are
too
hot
and
for
mine
own
part
i
have
not
a
case
of
lives
the
humour
of
it
is
too
hot
that
is
the
very
plainsong
of
it
the
plainsong

most
just
for

do
abound
knocks

i
were
in
an
alehouse
in
london
i
would
give
all
my
fame
for
a
pot
of
ale
and
safety
and
i
if
wishes
would
prevail
with
me
my
purpose
should
not
fail
with
me
but
thither
would
i
hie
as
duly
but
not
as
truly
as

your

wins
bad
humours
as
young
as
i
am
i
have
observed
these
three
swashers
i
am
boy
to
them
all
three
but
all
they
three
though
they
would
serve
me
could
not
be
man
to
me
for
indeed
three
such
antiques
do
not
amount
to
a
man
for
bardolph
he
is
whitelivered
and
redfaced
by
the
means
whereof
a
faces
it
out
but
fights
not
for
pistol
he
hath
a
killing
tongue
and
a
quiet
sword
by
the
means
whereof
a
breaks
words
and
keeps
whole
weapons
for
nym
he
hath
heard
that
men
of
few
words
are
the
best
men
and
therefore
he
scorns
to
say
his
prayers
lest
a
should
be
thought
a
coward
but
his
few
bad
words
are
matched
with
as
few
good
deeds
for
a
never
broke
any
mans
head
but
his
own
and
that
was
against
a
post
when
he
was
drunk
they
will
steal
any
thing
and
call
it
purchase
bardolph
stole
a
lutecase
bore
it
twelve
leagues
and
sold
it
for
three
halfpence
nym
and
bardolph
are
sworn
brothers
in
filching
and
in
calais
they
stole
a
fireshovel
i
knew
by
that
piece
of
service
the
men
would
carry
coals
they
would
have
me
as
familiar
with
mens
pockets
as
their
gloves
or
their
handkerchers
which
makes
much
against
my
manhood
if
i
should
take
from
anothers
pocket
to
put
into
mine
for
it
is
plain
pocketing
up
of
wrongs
i
must
leave
them
and
seek
some
better
service
their
villany
goes
against
my
weak
stomach
and
therefore
i
must
cast
it
up
captain
fluellen
you
must
come
presently
to
the
mines
the
duke
of
gloucester
would
speak
with
you
to
the
mines
tell
you
the
duke
it
is
not
so
good
to
come
to
the
mines
for
look
you
the
mines
is
not
according
to
the
disciplines
of
the
war
the
concavities
of
it
is
not
sufficient
for
look
you
th
athversary
you
may
discuss
unto
the
duke
look
you
is
digt
himself
four
yards
under
the
countermines
by
cheshu
i
think
a
will
plow
up
all
if
there
is
not
better
directions
the
duke
of
gloucester
to
whom
the
order
of
the
siege
is
given
is
altogether
directed
by
an
irishman
a
very
valiant
gentleman
i
faith
it
is
captain
macmorris
is
it
not
i
think
it
be
by
cheshu
he
is
an
ass
as
in
the
world
i
will
verify
as
much
in
his
peard
he
has
no
more
directions
in
the
true
disciplines
of
the
wars
look
you
of
the
roman
disciplines
than
is
a
puppydog
here
a
comes
and
the
scots
captain
captain
jamy
with
him
captain
jamy
is
a
marvellous
falorous
gentleman
that
is
certain
and
of
great
expedition
and
knowledge
in
th
aunchient
wars
upon
my
particular
knowledge
of
his
directions
by
cheshu
he
will
maintain
his
argument
as
well
as
any
military
man
in
the
world
in
the
disciplines
of
the
pristine
wars
of
the
romans
i

partly
for
the
satisfaction

not
many
of
your
nation
of
my
nation
what
ish
my
nation
ish
a
villain
and
a
bastard
and
a
knave
and
a
rascal
what
ish
my
nation
who
talks
of
my
nation
look
you
if
you
take
the
matter
otherwise
than
is
meant
captain
macmorris
peradventure
i
shall
think
you
do
not
use
me
with
that
affability
as
in
discretion
you
ought
to
use
me
look
you
being
as
good
a
man
as
yourself
both
in
the
disciplines
of
wars
and
in
the
derivation
of
my
birth
and
in
other
particularities
i
do
not
know
you
so
good
a
man
as
myself
so
chrish
save
me
i
will
cut
off
your
head
gentlemen
both
you
will
mistake
each
other
a
thats
a
foul
fault
the
town
sounds
a
parley
captain
macmorris
when
there
is
more
better
opportunity
to
be
required
look
you
i
will
be
so
bold
as
to
tell
you
i
know
the
disciplines
of
wars
and
there
is
an
end
how
yet
resolves
the
governor
of
the
town
this
is
the
latest
parle
we
will
admit
therefore
to
our
best
mercy
give
yourselves
or
like
to
men
proud
of
destruction
defy
us
to
our
worst
for
as
i
am
a
soldier
a
name
that
in
my
thoughts
becomes
me
best
if
i
begin
the
battery
once
again
i
will
not
leave
the
halfachieved
harfleur
till
in
her
ashes
she
lie
buried
the
gates
of
mercy
shall
be
all
shut
up
and
the
fleshd
soldier
rough
and
hard
of
heart
in
liberty
of
bloody
hand
shall
range
with
conscience
wide
as
hell
mowing
like
grass
your
freshfair
virgins
and
your
flowering
infants
what
is
it
then
to
me
if
impious
war
arrayd
in
flames
like
to
the
prince
of
fiends
do
with
his
smirchd
complexion
all
fell
feats
enlinkd
to
waste
and
desolation
what
ist
to
me
when
you
yourselves
are
cause
if
your
pure
maidens
fall
into
the
hand
of
hot
and
forcing
violation
what
rein
can
hold
licentious
wickedness
when
down
the
hill
he
holds
his
fierce
career
we
may
as
bootless
spend
our
vain
command
upon
the
enraged
soldiers
in
their
spoil
as
send
precepts
to
the
leviathan
to
come
ashore
therefore
you
men
of
harfleur
take
pity
of
your
town
and
of
your
people
whiles
yet
my
soldiers
are
in
my
command
whiles
yet
the
cool
and
temperate
wind
of
grace
oerblows
the
filthy
and
contagious
clouds
of
heady
murder
spoil
and
villany
if
not
why
in
a
moment
look
to
see
the
blind
and
bloody
soldier
with
foul
hand
defile
the
locks
of
your
shrillshrieking
daughters
your
fathers
taken
by
the
silver
beards
and
their
most
reverend
heads
dashd
to
the
walls
your
naked
infants
spitted
upon
pikes
whiles
the
mad
mothers
with
their
howls
confusd
do
break
the
clouds
as
did
the
wives
of
jewry
at
herods
bloodyhunting
slaughtermen
what
say
you
will
you
yield
and
this
avoid
or
guilty
in
defence
be
thus
destroyd
our
expectation
hath
this
day
an
end
the
dauphin
whom
of
succour
we
entreated
returns
us
that
his
powers
are
yet
not
ready
to
raise
so
great
a
siege
therefore

our
town
and

this
becomes
the
great
sorry
am
i
his

are
so
few
his

sick

in

for
i

offer

how
now
captain
fluellen
come
you
from
the
bridge
i
assure
you
there
is
very
excellent
services
committed
at
the
pridge
is
the
duke
of
exeter
safe
the
duke
of
exeter
is
as
magnanimous
as
agamemnon
and
a
man
that
i
love
and
honour
with
my
soul
and
my
heart
and
my
duty
and
my
life
and
my
living
and
my
uttermost
power
he
is
not
god
be
praised
and
plessed
any
hurt
in
the
world
but
keeps
the
pridge
most
valiantly
with
excellent
discipline
there
is
an
aunchient
lieutenant
there
at
the
pridge
i
think
in
my
very
conscience
he
is
as
valiant
a
man
as
mark
antony
and
he
is
a
man
of
no
estimation
in
the
world
but
i
did
see
him
do
as
gallant
service
what
do
you
call
him
he
is
called
aunchient
pistol
i
know
him
not
here
is
the
man
captain
i
thee
beseech
to
do
me
favours
the
duke
of
exeter
doth
love
thee
well
ay
i
praise
god
and
i
have
merited
some
love
at
his
hands
bardolph
a
soldier
firm
and
sound
of
heart
and
of
buxom
valour
hath
by
cruel
fate
and
giddy
fortunes
furious
fickle
wheel
that
goddess
blind
that
stands
upon
the
rolling
restless
stone
by
your
patience
aunchient
pistol
fortune
is
painted
plind
with
a
muffler
afore
her
eyes
to
signify
to
you
that
fortune
is
plind
and
she
is
painted
also
with
a
wheel
to
signify
to
you
which
is
the
moral
of
it
that
she
is
turning
and
inconstant
and
mutability
and
variation
and
her
foot
look
you
is
fixed
upon
a
spherical
stone
which
rolls
and
rolls
and
rolls
in
good
truth
the
poet
makes
a
most
excellent
description
of
it
fortune
is
an
excellent
moral
fortune
is
bardolphs
foe
and
frowns
on
him
for
he
hath
stoln
a
pax
and
hanged
must
a
be
a
damned
death
let
gallows
gape
for
dog
let
man
go
free
and
let
not
hemp
his
windpipe
suffocate
but
exeter
hath
given
the
doom
of
death
for
pax
of
little
price
therefore
go
speak
the
duke
will
hear
thy
voice
and
let
not
bardolphs
vital
thread
be
cut
with
edge
of
penny
cord
and
vile
reproach
speak
captain
for
his
life
and
i
will
thee
requite
aunchient
pistol
i
do
partly
understand
your
meaning
why
then
rejoice
therefore
certainly
aunchient
it
is
not
a
thing
to
rejoice
at
for
if
look
you
he
were
my
brother
i
would
desire
the
duke
to
use
his
good
pleasure
and
put
him
to
execution
for
discipline
ought
to
be
used
die
and
be
damnd
and
figo
for
thy
friendship
it
is
well
the
fig
of
spain
very
good
why
this
is
an
arrant
counterfeit
rascal
i
remember
him
now
a
bawd
a
cutpurse
ill
assure
you
a
uttered
as
prave
words
at
the
pridge
as
you
shall
see
in
a
summers
day
but
it
is
very
well
what
he
has
spoke
to
me
that
is
well
i
warrant
you
when
time
is
serve
why
tis
a
gull
a
fool
a
rogue
that
now
and
then
goes
to
the
wars
to
grace
himself
at
his
return
into
london
under
the
form
of
a
soldier
and
such
fellows
are
perfect
in
the
great
commanders
names
and
they
will
learn
you
by
rote
where
services
were
done
at
such
and
such
a
sconce
at
such
a
breach
at
such
a
convoy
who
came
off
bravely
who
was
shot
who
disgraced
what
terms
the
enemy
stood
on
and
this
they
con
perfectly
in
the
phrase
of
war
which
they
trick
up
with
newtuned
oaths
and
what
a
beard
of
the
generals
cut
and
a
horrid
suit
of
the
camp
will
do
among
foaming
bottles
and
alewashed
wits
is
wonderful
to
be
thought
on
but
you
must
learn
to
know
such
slanders
of
the
age
or
else
you
may
be
marvellously
mistook
i
tell
you
what
captain
gower
i
do
perceive
he
is
not
the
man
that
he
would
gladly
make
show
to
the
world
he
is
if
i
find
a
hole
in
his
coat
i
will
tell
him
my
mind
hark
you
the
king
is
coming
and
i
must
speak
with
him
from
the
pridgo
god
pless
your
majesty
how
now
fluellen
camst
thou
from
the
bridge
ay
so
please
your
majesty
the
duke
of
exeter
hath
very
gallantly
maintained
the
pridge
the
french
is
gone
off
look
you
and
there
is
gallant
and
most
prave
passages
marry
th
athversary
was
have
possession
of
the
pridge
but
he
is
enforced
to
retire
and
the
duke
of
exeter
is
master
of
the
pridge
i
can
tell
your
majesty
the
duke
is
a
prave
man
what
men
have
you
lost
fluellen
the
perdition
of
th
athversary
hath
been
very
great
reasonable
great
marry
for
my
part
i
think
the
duke
hath
lost
never
a
man
but
one
that
is
like
to
be
executed
for
robbing
a
church
one
bardolph
if
your
majesty
know
the
man
his
face
is
all
bubukles
and
whelks
and
knobs
and
flames
o
fire
and
his
lips
blows
at
his
nose
and
it
is
like
a
coal
of
fire
sometimes
plue
and
sometimes
red
but
his
nose
is
executed
and
his
fires
out
we
would
have
all
such
offenders
so
cut
off
and
we
give
express
charge
that
in
our
marches
through
the
country
there
be
nothing
compelled
from
the
villages
nothing
taken
but
paid
for
none
of
the
french
upbraided
or
abused
in
disdainful
language
for
when
lenity
and
cruelty
play
for
a
kingdom
the
gentler
gamester
is
the
soonest
winner
you
know
me
by
my
habit
well
then
i
know
thee
what
shall
i
know
of
thee
my
masters
mind
unfold
it
thus
says
my
king
say
thou
to
harry
of
england
though
we
seemed
dead
we
did
but
sleep
advantage
is
a
better
soldier
than
rashness
tell
him
we
could
have
rebuked
him
at
harfleur
but
that
we
thought
not
good
to
bruise
an
injury
till
it
were
full
ripe
now
we
speak
upon
our
cue
and
our
voice
is
imperial
england
shall
repent
his
folly
see
his
weakness
and
admire
our
sufferance
bid
him
therefore
consider
of
his
ransom
which
must
proportion
the
losses
we
have
borne
the
subjects
we
have
lost
the
disgrace
we
have
digested
which
in
weight
to
reanswer
his
pettiness
would
bow
under
for
our
losses
his
exchequer
is
too
poor
for
the
effusion
of
our
blood
the
muster
of
his
kingdom
too
faint
a
number
and
for
our
disgrace
his
own
person
kneeling
at
our
feet
but
a
weak
and
worthless
satisfaction
to
this
add
defiance
and
tell
him
for
conclusion
he
hath
betrayed
his
followers
whose
condemnation
is
pronounced
so
far
my
king
and
master
so
much
my
office
what
is
thy
name
i
know
thy
quality
montjoy
thou
dost
thy
office
fairly
turn
thee
back
and
tell
thy
king
i
do
not
seek
him
now
but
could
be
willing
to
march
on
to
calais
without
impeachment
for
to
say
the
sooth
though
tis
no
wisdom
to
confess
so
much
unto
an
enemy
of
craft
and
vantage
my
people
are
with
sickness
much
enfeebled
my
numbers
lessend
and
those
few
i
have
almost
no
better
than
so
many
french
who
when
they
were
in
health
i
tell
thee
herald
i
thought
upon
one
pair
of
english
legs
did
march
three
frenchmen
yet
forgive
me
god
that
i
do
brag
thus
this
your
air
of
france
hath
blown
that
vice
in
me
i
must
repent
go
therefore
tell
thy
master
here
i
am
my
ransom
is
this
frail
and
worthless
trunk
my
army
but
a
weak
and
sickly
guard
yet
god
before
tell
him
we
will
come
on
though
france
himself
and
such
another
neighbour
stand
in
our
way
theres
for
thy
labour
montjoy
go
bid
thy
master
well
advise
himself
if
we
may
pass
we
will
if
we
be
hinderd
we
shall
your
tawny
ground
with
your
red
blood
discolour
and
so
montjoy
fare
you
well
the
sum
of
all
our
answer
is
but
this
we
would
not
seek
a
battle
as
we
are
nor
as
we
are
we
say
we
will
not
shun
it
so
tell
your
master
i
shall
deliver
so
thanks
to
your
highness
i
hope
they
will
not
come
upon
us
now
we
are
in
gods
hand
brother
not
in
theirs
march
to
the
bridge
it
now
draws
toward
night
beyond
the
river
well
encamp
ourselves
and
on
tomorrow
bid
them
march
away
tut
i
have
the
best
armour
of
the
world
would
it
were
day
you
have
an
excellent
armour
but
let
my
horse
have
his
due
it
is
the
best
horse
of
europe
will
it
never
be
morning
my
lord
of
orleans
and
my
lord
high
constable
you
talk
of
horse
and
armour
you
are
as
well
provided
of
both
as
any
prince
in
the
world
what
a
long
night
is
this
i
will
not
change
my
horse
with
any
that
treads
but
on
four
pasterns
a
ha
he
bounds
from
the
earth
as
if
his
entrails
were
hairs
le
cheval
volant
the
pegasus
qui
a
les
narines
de
feu
when
i
bestride
him
i
soar
i
am
a
hawk
he
trots
the
air
the
earth
sings
when
he
touches
it
the
basest
horn
of
his
hoof
is
more
musical
than
the
pipe
of
hermes
hes
of
the
colour
of
the
nutmeg
and
of
the
heat
of
the
ginger
it
is
a
beast
for
perseus
he
is
pure
air
and
fire
and
the
dull
elements
of
earth
and
water
never
appear
in
him
but
only
in
patient
stillness
while
his
rider
mounts
him
he
is
indeed
a
horse
and
all
other
jades
you
may
call
beasts
indeed
my
lord
it
is
a
most
absolute
and
excellent
horse
it
is
the
prince
of
palfreys
his
neigh
is
like
the
bidding
of
a
monarch
and
his
countenance
enforces
homage
no
more
cousin
nay
the
man
hath
no
wit
that
cannot
from
the
rising
of
the
lark
to
the
lodging
of
the
lamb
vary
deserved
praise
on
my
palfrey
it
is
a
theme
as
fluent
as
the
sea
turn
the
sands
into
eloquent
tongues
and
my
horse
is
argument
for
them
all
tis
a
subject
for
a
sovereign
to
reason
on
and
for
a
sovereigns
sovereign
to
ride
on
and
for
the
world
familiar
to
us
and
unknown
to
lay
apart
their
particular
functions
and
wonder
at
him
i
once
writ
a
sonnet
in
his
praise
and
began
thus
wonder
of
nature
i
have
heard
a
sonnet
begin
so
to
ones
mistress
then
did
they
imitate
that
which
i
composed
to
my
courser
for
my
horse
is
my
mistress
your
mistress
bears
well
me
well
which
is
the
prescript
praise
and
perfection
of
a
good
and
particular
mistress
ma
foi
methought
yesterday
your
mistress
shrewdly
shook
your
back
so
perhaps
did
yours
mine
was
not
bridled
o
then
belike
she
was
old
and
gentle
and
you
rode
like
a
kern
of
ireland
your
french
hose
off
and
in
your
straight
strossers
you
have
good
judgment
in
horsemanship
be
warned
by
me
then
they
that
ride
so
and
ride
not
warily
fall
into
foul
bogs
i
had
rather
have
my
horse
to
my
mistress
i
had
as
lief
have
my
mistress
a
jade
i
tell
thee
constable
my
mistress
wears
his
own
hair

a
valiant
and
most
expert
gentleman
would
it
were
day
alas
poor
harry
of
england
he
longs
not
for
the
dawning
as
we
do
what
a
wretched
and
peevish
fellow
is
this
king
of
england
to
mope
with
his
fatbrained
followers
so
far
out
of
his
knowledge
if
the
english
had
any
apprehension
they
would
run
away
that
they
lack
for
if
their
heads
had
any
intellectual
armour
they
could
never
wear
such
heavy
headpieces
that
island
of
england
breeds
very
valiant
creatures
their
mastiffs
are
of
unmatchable
courage
foolish
curs
that
run
winking
into
the
mouth
of
a
russian
bear
and
have
their
heads
crushed
like
rotten
apples
you
may
as
well
say
thats
a
valiant
flea
that
dare
eat
his
breakfast
on
the
lip
of
a
lion
just
just
and
the
men
do
sympathize
with
the
mastiffs
in
robustious
and
rough
coming
on
leaving
their
wits
with
their
wives
and
then
give
them
great
meals
of
beef
and
iron
and
steel
they
will
eat
like
wolves
and
fight
like
devils
ay
but
these
english
are
shrewdly
out
of
beef
then
shall
we
find
tomorrow
they
have
only
stomachs
to
eat
and
none
to
fight
now
is
it
time
to
arm
come
shall
we
about
it
it
is
now
two
oclock
but
let
me
see
by
ten
we
shall
have
each
a
hundred
englishmen
now
entertain
conjecture
of
a
time
when
creeping
murmur
and
the
poring
dark
fills
the
wide
vessel
of
the
universe
from
camp
to
camp
through
the
foul
womb
of
night
the
hum
of
either
army
stilly
sounds
that
the
fixd
sentinels
almost
receive
the
secret
whispers
of
each
others
watch
fire
answers
fire
and
through
their
paly
flames
each
battle
sees
the
others
umberd
face
steed
threatens
steed
in
high
and
boastful
neighs
piercing
the
nights
dull
ear
and
from
the
tents
the
armourers
accomplishing
the
knights
with
busy
hammers
closing
rivets
up
give
dreadful
note
of
preparation
the
country
cocks
do
crow
the

do

like

doth
limp

tediously
away
the

their

them
unto

o
now
who
will
behold
the
royal
captain
of
this
ruind
band
walking
from

to

from
tent
to

let
him
cry
praise
and
glory
on
his

for
forth
he
goes
and
visits
all
his
host
bids
them
good
morrow
with
a
modest
smile
and
calls
them
brothers
friends
and
countrymen
upon
his
royal
face
there
is
no
note
how
dread
an
army
hath
enrounded
him
nor
doth
he
dedicate
one
jot
of
colour
unto
the
weary
and
allwatched
night
but
freshly
looks
and
overbears
attaint
with
cheerful
semblance
and
sweet
majesty
that
every
wretch
pining
and
pale
before
beholding
him
plucks
comfort
from
his
looks
a
largess
universal
like
the
sun
his
liberal
eye
doth
give
to
every

thawing
cold
fear
then

and
gentle
all

as
may
unworthiness
define
a
little

of
harry
in
the
night
and
so
our
scene
must
to
the
battle
fly
where
o
for
pity
we
shall
much
disgrace
with
four
or
five
most
vile
and
ragged

by
what

tis
true
that
we
are
in

therefore
should
our

besides
they
are

to
us
all
admonishing
that
we
should
dress
us
fairly
for

thus
may
we

captain
fluellen
sol
in
the
name
of
cheshu
christ
speak
lower
it
is
the
greatest
admiration
in
the
universal
world
when
the
true
and
auncient
prerogatifes
and
laws
of
the
wars
is
not
kept
if
you
would
take
the
pains
but
to
examine
the
wars
of
pompey
the
great
you
shall
find
i
warrant
you
that
there
is
no
tiddletaddle
nor
pibblepabble
in
pompeys
camp
i
warrant
you
you
shall
find
the
ceremonies
of
the
wars
and
the
cares
of
it
and
the
forms
of
it
and
the
sobriety
of
it
and
the
modesty
of
it
to
be
otherwise
why
the
enemy
is
loud
you
heard
him
all
night
if
the
enemy
is
an
ass
and
a
fool
and
a
prating
coxcomb
is
it
meet
think
you
that
we
should
also
look
you
be
an
ass
and
a
fool
and
a
prating
coxcomb
in
your
own
conscience
now
i
will
speak
lower
i
pray
you
and
peseech
you
that
you
will
though
it
appear
a
little
out
of
fashion
there
is
much
care
and
valour
in
this
welshman
brother
john
bates
is
not
that
the
morning
which
breaks
yonder
i
think
it
be
but
we
have
no
great
cause
to
desire
the
approach
of
day
we
see
yonder
the
beginning
of
the
day
but
i
think
we
shall
never
see
the
end
of
it
who
goes
there
a
friend
under
what
captain
serve
you
under
sir
thomas
erpingham
a
good
old
commander
and
a
most
kind
gentleman
i
pray
you
what
thinks
he
of
our
estate
even
as
men
wracked
upon
a
sand
that
look
to
be
washed
off
the
next
tide
he
hath
not
told
his
thought
to
the
king
no
nor
it
is
not
meet
he
should
for
though
i
speak
it
to
you
i
think
the
king
is
but
a
man
as
i
am
the
violet
smells
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
the
element
shows
to
him
as
it
doth
to
me
all
his
senses
have
but
human
conditions
his
ceremonies
laid
by
in
his
nakedness
he
appears
but
a
man
and
though
his
affections
are
higher
mounted
than
ours
yet
when
they
stoop
they
stoop
with
the
like
wing
therefore
when
he
sees
reason
of
fears
as
we
do
his
fears
out
of
doubt
be
of
the
same
relish
as
ours
are
yet
in
reason
no
man
should
possess
him
with
any
appearance
of
fear
lest
he
by
showing
it
should
dishearten
his
army
he
may
show
what
outward
courage
he
will
but
i
believe
as
cold
a
night
as
tis
he
could
wish
himself
in
thames
up
to
the
neck
and
so
i
would
he
were
and
i
by
him
at
all
adventures
so
we
were
quit
here
by
my
troth
i
will
speak
my
conscience
of
the
king
i
think
he
would
not
wish
himself
any
where
but
where
he
is
then
i
would
he
were
here
alone
so
should
he
be
sure
to
be
ransomed
and
a
many
poor
mens
lives
saved
i
dare
say
you
love
him
not
so
ill
to
wish
him
here
alone
howsoever
you
speak
this
to
feel
other
mens
minds
methinks
i
could
not
die
any
where
so
contented
as
in
the
kings
company
his
cause
being
just
and
his
quarrel
honourable
thats
more
than
we
know
ay
or
more
than
we
should
seek
after
for
we
know
enough
if
we
know
we
are
the
kings
subjects
if
his
cause
be
wrong
our
obedience
to
the
king
wipes
the
crime
of
it
out
of
us
but
if
the
cause
be
not
good
the
king
himself
hath
a
heavy
reckoning
to
make
when
all
those
legs
and
arms
and
heads
chopped
off
in
a
battle
shall
join
together
at
the
latter
day
and
cry
all
we
died
at
such
a
place
some
swearing
some
crying
for
a
surgeon
some
upon
their
wives
left
poor
behind
them
some
upon
the
debts
they
owe
some
upon
their
children
rawly
left
i
am
afeard
there
are
few
die
well
that
die
in
a
battle
for
how
can
they
charitably
dispose
of
any
thing
when
blood
is
their
argument
now
if
these
men
do
not
die
well
it
will
be
a
black
matter
for
the
king
that
led
them
to
it
whom
to
disobey
were
against
all
proportion
of
subjection
so
if
a
son
that
is
by
his
father
sent
about
merchandise
do
sinfully
miscarry
upon
the
sea
the
imputation
of
his
wickedness
by
your
rule
should
be
imposed
upon
his
father
that
sent
him
or
if
a
servant
under
his
masters
command
transporting
a
sum
of
money
be
assailed
by
robbers
and
die
in
many
irreconciled
iniquities
you
may
call
the
business
of
the
master
the
author
of
the
servants
damnation
but
this
is
not
so
the
king
is
not
bound
to
answer
the
particular
endings
of
his
soldiers
the
father
of
his
son
nor
the
master
of
his
servant
for
they
purpose
not
their
death
when
they
purpose
their
services
besides
there
is
no
king
be
his
cause
never
so
spotless
if
it
come
to
the
arbitrement
of
swords
can
try
it
out
with
all
unspotted
soldiers
some
peradventure
have
on
them
the
guilt
of
premeditated
and
contrived
murder
some
of
beguiling
virgins
with
the
broken
seals
of
perjury
some
making
the
wars
their
bulwark
that
have
before
gored
the
gentle
bosom
of
peace
with
pillage
and
robbery
now
if
these
men
have
defeated
the
law
and
outrun
native
punishment
though
they
can
outstrip
men
they
have
no
wings
to
fly
from
god
war
is
his
beadle
war
is
his
vengeance
so
that
here
men
are
punished
for
beforebreach
of
the
kings
laws
in
now
the
kings
quarrel
where
they
feared
the
death
they
have
borne
life
away
and
where
they
would
be
safe
they
perish
then
if
they
die
unprovided
no
more
is
the
king
guilty
of
their
damnation
than
he
was
before
guilty
of
those
impieties
for
the
which
they
are
now
visited
every
subjects
duty
is
the
kings
but
every
subjects
soul
is
his
own
therefore
should
every
soldier
in
the
wars
do
as
every
sick
man
in
his
bed
wash
every
mote
out
of
his
conscience
and
dying
so
death
is
to
him
advantage
or
not
dying
the
time
was
blessedly
lost
wherein
such
preparation
was
gained
and
in
him
that
escapes
it
were
not
sin
to
think
that
making
god
so
free
an
offer
he
let
him
outlive
that
day
to
see
his
greatness
and
to
teach
others
how
they
should
prepare
tis
certain
every
man
that
dies
ill
the
ill
upon
his
own
head
the
king
is
not
to
answer
it
i
do
not
desire
he
should
answer
for
me
and
yet
i
determine
to
fight
lustily
for
him
i
myself
heard
the
king
say
he
would
not
be
ransomed
ay
he
said
so
to
make
us
fight
cheerfully
but
when
our
throats
are
cut
he
may
be
ransomed
and
we
neer
the
wiser
if
i
live
to
see
it
i
will
never
trust
his
word
after
you
pay
him
then
thats
a
perilous
shot
out
of
an
eldergun
that
a
poor
and
a
private
displeasure
can
do
against
a
monarch
you
may
as
well
go
about
to
turn
the
sun
to
ice
with
fanning
in
his
face
with
a
peacocks
feather
youll
never
trust
his
word
after
come
tis
a
foolish
saying
your
reproof
is
something
too
round
i
should
be
angry
with
you
if
the
time
were
convenient
let
it
be
a
quarrel
between
us
if
you
live
i
embrace
it
how
shall
i
know
thee
again
give
me
any
gage
of
thine
and
i
will
wear
it
in
my
bonnet
then
if
ever
thou
darest
acknowledge
it
i
will
make
it
my
quarrel
heres
my
glove
give
me
another
of
thine
there
this
will
i
also
wear
in
my
cap
if
ever
thou
come
to
me
and
say
after
tomorrow
this
is
my
glove
by
this
hand
i
will
take
thee
a
box
on
the
ear
if
ever
i
live
to
see
it
i
will
challenge
it
thou
darest
as
well
be
hanged
well
i
will
do
it
though
i
take
thee
in
the
kings
company
keep
thy
word
fare
thee
well
be
friends
you
english
fools
be
friends
we
have
french
quarrels
enow
if
you
could
tell
how
to
reckon
indeed
the
french
may
lay
twenty
french
crowns
to
one
they
will
beat
us
for
they
bear
them
on
their
shoulders
but
it
is
no
english
treason
to
cut
french
crowns
and
tomorrow
the
king
himself
will
be
a
clipper
upon
the
king
let
us
our
lives
our
souls
our
debts
our
careful
wives
our
children
and
our
sins
lay
on
the
king
we
must
bear
all
o
hard
condition
twinborn
with
greatness
subject
to
the
breath
of
every
fool
whose
sense
no
more
can
feel
but
his
own
wringing
what
infinite
hearts
ease
must
kings
neglect
that
private
men
enjoy
and
what
have
kings
that
privates
have
not
too
save
ceremony
save
general
ceremony
and
what
art
thou
thou
idle
ceremony
what
kind
of

art
thou
that
sufferst
more
of
mortal
griefs
than
do
thy
worshippers
what
are
thy
rents
what
are
thy
comingsin
o

show
me
but
thy
worth
what
is
thy
soul
of
adoration
art
thou
aught
else
but
place
degree
and
form
creating
awe
and
fear
in
other

wherein
thou
art
less
happy

they
in

thou
oft
instead
of

thy

my

hark
how
our

for

service
neigh
mount
them
and
make
incision
in
their

that
their
hot

may
spin

them
with
superfluous
courage
ha
what
will
you
have

weep

how
shall
we
then
behold
their

the

are
embattaild
you
french
peers
to

you
gallant
princes
straight
to

do
but
behold
yon
poor
and
starved
band
and
your
fair

shall
suck
away

leaving
them

the

there
is
not
work
enough
for

scarce
blood
enough
in

their
sickly

to
give
each
naked
curtalaxe
a
stain
that
our
french
gallants
shall
today
draw
out
and
sheathe
for
lack
of
sport
let
us
but
blow
on
them
the
vapour
of
our
valour
will
oerturn
them
tis
positive
gainst
all
exceptions
lords
that
our
superfluous
lackeys
and
our
peasants
who
in
unnecessary
action
swarm
about
our
squares
of
battle
were
enow
to
purge
this
field
of
such
a
hilding
foe
though
we
upon
this
mountains
basis
by
took
stand
for
idle
speculation
but
that
our
honours
must
not
whats
to
say
a
very
little
little
let
us
do
and
all
is
done
then
let
the

sound
the
tucket
sonance
and
the
note
to
mount
for
our
approach
shall
so
much
dare
the
field
that
england
shall
couch
down
in

and

why
do
you
stay
so
long
my
lords
of

yon

carrions
desperate
of

illfavourdly
become
the

field
their
ragged
curtains
poorly
are
let
loose
and
our
air
shakes
them
passing
scornfully
big
mars
seems
bankrupt
in
their
beggard
host
and
faintly
through
a
rusty

peeps
the
horsemen
sit
like
fixed
candlesticks
with
torchstaves
in

and
their
poor
jades
lob
down
their
heads
dropping
the
hides
and
hips
the
gum
downroping
from
their
paledead
eyes
and
in
their
pale
dull
mouths
the
gimmal
bit
lies
foul
with
chewd
grass
still
and
motionless
and
their
executors
the
knavish

fly

impatient
for

cannot
suit
itself
in
words
to
demonstrate
the
life
of
such
a
battle
in
life
so
lifeless
as
it
shows
itself
they
have
said
their
prayers
and
they
stay
for
death
shall
we
go
send
them
dinners
and
fresh
suits
and
give
their
fasting
horses
provender
and
after
fight
with
them
i
stay
but
for
my
guard
on
to
the
field
i
will
the
banner
from
a
trumpet
take
and
use
it
for
my
haste
come
come
away
the
sun
is
high
and
we
outwear
the
day
where

the

yearns
me
not
if
men
my
garments
wear
such
outward
things
dwell
not
in
my
desires
but
if
it
be
a
sin
to
covet

no
stomach
to
this
fight
let
him
depart
his
passport
shall

his
purse
we

places
god

with
you
all
once
more
i
come
to
know
of
thee
king
harry

thy
ransom
thou
wilt
now
compound
before
thy
most
assured
overthrow
for
certainly
thou
art
so
near
the
gulf
thou
needs
must
be
englutted
besides
in
mercy
the
constable
desires
thee
thou
wilt
mind
thy
followers
of
repentance
that
their
souls
may
make
a
peaceful
and
a
sweet
retire
from
off
these
fields
where
wretches
their
poor
bodies
must
lie
and
fester
who
hath
sent
thee
now
the
constable
of
france
i
pray
thee
bear
my
former
answer
back
bid
them
achieve
me
and
then
sell
my
bones
good
god

should
they
mock
poor
fellows

the
man
that
once
did
sell
the
lions
skin
while
the
beast
livd
was
killd
with
hunting
him
a
many
of
our
bodies
shall
no
doubt
find
native
graves
upon
the
which
i
trust
shall
witness
live
in
brass
of
this
days
work
and
those
that
leave
their
valiant
bones
in
france
dying
like
men
though
buried
in
your
dunghills
they
shall
be
famd
for
there
the
sun
shall
greet
them
and
draw
their
honours
reeking
up
to
heaven
leaving
their
earthly
parts
to
choke
your
clime
the
smell
whereof
shall
breed
a
plague
in
france
mark
then
abounding
valour
in
our
english
that
being
dead
like
to
the

done
this
slaughter
besides
they
have
burned

that
the

look
you
is
both
alike
there
is
a

now
we
bear
the
king
toward
calais
grant
him
there
there
seen
heave
him
away
upon
your
winged
thoughts
athwart
the
sea
behold
the
english
beach
pales
in
the
flood
with
men
with
wives
and
boys
whose
shouts
and
claps
outvoice
the
deepmouthd
sea
which
like
a
mighty
whiffler
fore
the
king
seems
to
prepare
his
way
so
let
him
land
and
solemnly
see
him
set
on
to
london
so
swift
a
pace
hath
thought
that
even
now
you
may
imagine
him
upon
blackheath
where
that
his
lords
desire
him
to
have
borne
his
bruised
helmet
and
his
bended
sword
before
him
through
the
city
he
forbids
it
being
free
from
vainness
and
selfglorious
pride
giving
full
trophy
signal
and
ostent
quite
from
himself
to
god
but
now
behold
in
the
quick
forge
and
workinghouse
of
thought
how
london
doth
pour
out
her
citizens
the
mayor
and
all
his
brethren
in
best
sort
like
to
the
senators
of
the
antique
rome
with
the
plebeians
swarming
at
their
heels
go
forth
and
fetch
their
conquering
c
sar
in
as
by
a
lower
but
loving
likelihood
were
now
the
general
of
our
gracious
empress
as
in
good
time
he
may
from
ireland
coming
bringing
rebellion
broached
on
his
sword
how
many
would
the
peaceful
city
quit
to
welcome
him
much
more
and
much
more
cause
did
they
this
harry
now
in
london
place
him
as
yet
the
lamentation
of
the
french
invites
the
king
of
englands
stay
at
home
the
emperors
coming
in
behalf
of
france
to
order
peace
between
them

imperial
majesties
unto
this
bar
and
royal
interview
your
mightiness

both
parts
best

my
office

so
far
prevaild
that
face
to
face
and
royal
eye
to
eye
you
have
congreeted
let
it
not
disgrace
me
if
i
demand
before
this
royal
view
what
rub
or
what
impediment
there
is
why
that
the
naked
poor
and
mangled
peace
dear
nurse
of
arts
plenties
and
joyful
births
should
not
in
this
best
garden
of
the
world
our
fertile
france
put
up
her
lovely
visage
alas
she
hath
from
france
too
long
been
chasd
and
all
her
husbandry
doth
lie
on
heaps
corrupting
in
its
own
fertility
her
vine
the
merry
cheerer
of
the
heart
unpruned
dies
her
hedges
evenpleachd
like
prisoners
wildly
overgrown
with
hair
put
forth
disorderd
twigs
her
fallow
leas
the
darnel
hemlock
and
rank
fumitory
doth
root
upon
while
that
the
coulter
rusts
that
should
deracinate
such
savagery
the
even
mead
that
erst
brought
sweetly
forth
the
freckled
cowslip
burnet
and
green
clover
wanting
the
scythe
all
uncorrected
rank
conceives
by
idleness
and
nothing
teems
but
hateful
docks
rough
thistles
kecksies
burs
losing
both
beauty
and
utility
and
as
our
vineyards
fallows
meads
and
hedges
defective
in
their
natures
grow
to
wildness
even
so
our
houses
and
ourselves
and
children
have
lost
or
do
not
learn
for
want
of
time
the
sciences
that
should
become
our
country
but
grow
like
savages
as
soldiers
will
that
nothing
do
but
meditate
on
blood
to
swearing
and
stern
looks
diffusd
attire
and
every
thing
that
seems
unnatural
which
to
reduce
into
our
former
favour
you
are
assembled
and
my
speech
entreats
that
i
may
know
the
let
why
gentle
peace
should
not
expel
these
inconveniences
and
bless
us
with
her
former
qualities
if
duke
of
burgundy
you
would
the
peace
whose
want
gives
growth
to
the
imperfections
which

have
cited

peace

love
but
directly
to
say
i
love
you
then
if
you
urge
me
further
than
to
say
do
you
in
faith
i
wear
out
my
suit
give
me
your
answer
i
faith
do
and
so
clap
hands
and
a
bargain
how
say
you
lady
sauf
vostre
honneur
me
understand
vell
marry
if
you
would
put
me
to
verses
or
to
dance
for
your
sake
kate
why
you
undid
me
for
the
one
i
have
neither
words
nor
measure
and
for
the
other
i
have
no
strength
in
measure
yet
a
reasonable
measure
in
strength
if
i
could
win
a
lady
at
leapfrog
or
by
vaulting
into
my
saddle
with
my
armour
on
my
back
under
the
correction
of
bragging
be
it
spoken
i
should
quickly
leap
into
a
wife
or
if
i
might
buffet
for
my
love
or
bound
my
horse
for
her
favours
i
could
lay
on
like
a
butcher
and
sit
like
a
jackanapes
never
off
but
before
god
kate
i
cannot
look
greenly
nor
gasp
out
my
eloquence
nor
i
have
no
cunning
in
protestation
only
downright
oaths
which
i
never
use
till
urged
nor
never
break
for
urging
if
thou
caust
love
a
fellow
of
this
temper
kate
whose
face
is
not
worth
sunburning
that
never
looks
in
his
glass
for
love
of
anything
he
sees
there
let
thine
eye
be
thy
cook
i
speak
to
thee
plain
soldier
if
thou
canst
love
me
for
this
take
me
if
not
to
say
to
thee
that
i
shall
die
is
true
but
for
thy
love
by
the
lord
no
yet
i
love
thee
too
and
while
thou
livest
dear
kate
take
a
fellow
of
plain
and
uncoined
constancy
for
he
perforce
must
do
thee
right
because
he
hath
not
the
gift
to
woo
in
other
places
for
these
fellows
of
infinite
tongue
that
can
rime
themselves
into
ladies
favours
they
do
always
reason
themselves
out
again
what
a
speaker
is
but
a
prater
a
rime
is
but
a
ballad
a
good
leg
will
fall
a
straight
back
will
stoop
a
black
beard
will
turn
white
a
curled
pate
will
grow
bald
a
fair
face
will
wither
a
full
eye
will
wax
hollow
but
a
good
heart
kate
is
the
sun
and
the
moon
or
rather
the
sun
and
not
the
moon
for
it
shines
bright
and
never
changes
but
keeps
his
course
truly
if
thou
would
have
such
a
one
take
me
and
take
me
take
a
soldier
take
a
soldier
take
a
king
and
what
sayest
thou
then
to
my
love
speak
my
fair
and
fairly
i
pray
thee
is
it
possible
dat
i
sould
love
de
enemy
of
france
no
it
is
not
possible
you
should
love
the
enemy
of
france
kate
but
in
loving
me
you
should
love
the
friend
of
france
for
i
love
france
so
well
that
i
will
not
part
with
a
village
of
it
i
will
have
it
all
mine

kate

will
tell
thee
in
french
which
i

upon
my
tongue

hardly
to
be
shook

it

would

nice

curtsy
to

dear
kate
you
and
i
cannot
be
confined
within
the
weak
list
of
a
countrys
fashion
we
are
the
makers
of
manners
kate
and
the
liberty
that
follows
our
places
stops
the
mouths
of
all
findfaults
as
i
will
do
yours
for
upholding
the
nice
fashion
of
your
country
in
denying
me
a
kiss
therefore
patiently
and
yielding
you
have
witchcraft
in
your
lips
kate
there
is
more
eloquence
in
a
sugar
touch
of
them
than
in
the
tongues
of
the
french
council
and
they
should
sooner
persuade
harry
of
england
than
a
general
petition
of
monarchs
here
comes
your
father
god
save
your
majesty
my
royal
cousin
teach
you
our
princess
english
i
would
have
her
learn
my
fair
cousin
how
perfectly
i
love
her
and
that
is
good
english
is
she
not
apt
our
tongue
is
rough
coz
and
my
condition
is
not
smooth
so
that
having
neither
the
voice
nor
the
heart
of
flattery
about
me
i
cannot
so
conjure
up
the
spirit
of
love
in
her
that
he
will
appear
in
his
true
likeness
pardon
the
frankness
of
my
mirth
if
i
answer
you
for
that
if
you
would
conjure
in
her
you
must
make
a
circle
if
conjure
up
love
in
her
in
his
true
likeness
he
must
appear
naked
and
blind
can
you
blame
her
then
being
a
maid
yet
rosed
over
with
the
virgin
crimson
of
modesty
if
she
deny
the
appearance
of
a
naked
blind
boy
in
her
naked
seeing
self
it
were
my
lord
a
hard
condition
for
a
maid
to
consign
to
yet
they
do
wink
and
yield
as
love
is
blind
and
enforces
they
are
then
excused
my
lord
when
they
see
not
what
they
do
then
good
my
lord
teach
your
cousin
to
consent
winking
i
will
wink
on
her
to
consent
my
lord
if
you
will
teach
her
to
know
my
meaning
for
maids
well
summered
and
warm
kept
are
like
flies
at
bartholomewtide
blind
though
they
have
their
eyes
and
then
they
will
endure
handling
which
before
would
not
abide
looking
on
this
moral
ties
me
over
to
time
and
a
hot
summer
and
so
i
shall
catch
the
fly
your
cousin
in
the
latter
end
and
she
must
be
blind
too
as
love
is
my
lord
before
it
loves
it
is
so
and
you
may
some
of
you
thank
love
for
my
blindness
who
cannot
see
many
a
fair
french
city
for
one
fair
french
maid
that
stands
in
my
way
yes
my
lord
you
see
them
perspectively
the
cities
turned
into
a
maid
for
they
are
all
girdled
with
maiden
walls
that
war
hath
never
entered
shall
kate
be
my
wife
so
please
you
i
am
content
so
the
maiden
cities
you
talk
of
may
wait
on
her
so
the
maid
that
stood
in
the
way
for
my
wish
shall
show
me
the
way
to
my
will
we

consented
to
all
terms
of

granted

and

to
their
firm
proposed
natures

will
stop
the

the
which
in

hath
beaten
down
young
hotspur

his
troops
quenching
the
flame
of
bold
rebellion
even
with
the

blood
but
what
mean
i
to
speak
so
true
at
first
my
office
is
to
noise
abroad
that
harry
monmouth
fell
under
the
wrath
of

his

that
young
harry
percys
spur

cold
with
that
he
gave
his
able
horse

head
and
bending
forward
struck
his
armed
heels
against
the
panting
sides
of
his
poor
jade
up
to
the
rowelhead
and
starting
so
he
seemd
in

to
devour
the
way

the
day
upon
mine
honour
for
a
silken
point

give
my
barony

it
why
should
the
gentleman
that
rode
by
travers
give
then
such
instances
of
loss
who
he
he
was
some
hilding
fellow
that
had
stolen
the
horse
he
rode
on
and
upon
my
life
spoke
at
a
venture
look
here
comes
more
news
yea
this
mans
brow
like
to
a
titleleaf
foretells
the
nature
of
a
tragic
volume
so
looks
the
strond
whereon
the
imperious
flood
hath
left
a
witnessd
usurpation
say
morton
didst
thou
come
from
shrewsbury
i
ran
from
shrewsbury
my
noble
lord
where
hateful
death
put
on
his
ugliest
mask
to
fright
our
party
how
doth
my
son
and
brother
thou
tremblest
and
the
whiteness
in
thy
cheek
is
apter
than
thy
tongue
to
tell
thy
errand
even
such
a
man
so
faint
so
spiritless
so
dull
so
dead
in
look
so
woebegone
drew
priams
curtain
in
the
dead
of
night
and
would
have
told
him
half
his
troy
was
burnd
but
priam
found
the
fire
ere
he
his
tongue
and
i
my
percys
death
ere
thou
reportst
it
this
thou
wouldst
say
your
son
did
thus
and
thus
your
brother
thus
so
fought
the
noble
douglas
stopping
my
greedy
ear
with
their
bold
deeds
but
in
the
end
to
stop
mine
ear
indeed
thou
hast
a
sigh
to
blow
away
this
praise
ending
with
brother
son
and
all
are
dead
douglas
is
living
and
your
brother
yet
but
for
my
lord
your
son
why
he
is
dead
see
what
a
ready
tongue
suspicion
hath
he
that
but
fears
the
thing
he
would
not
know
hath
by
instinct
knowledge
from
others
eyes
that
what
he
feard
is
chanced
yet
speak
morton
tell
thou
thy
earl
his
divination
lies
and
i
will
take
it
as
a
sweet
disgrace
and
make
thee
rich
for
doing
me
such
wrong
you
are
too
great
to
be
by
me
gainsaid
your
spirit
is
too
true
your
fears
too
certain
yet
for
all
this
say
not
that
percys
dead
i
see
a
strange
confession
in
thine
eye
thou
shakst
thy
head
and
holdst
it
fear
or
sin
to
speak
a
truth
if
he
be
slain
say
so
the
tongue
offends
not
that
reports
his
death
and
he
doth
sin
that
doth
belie
the
dead
not
he
which
says
the
dead
is
not
alive
yet
the
first
bringer
of
unwelcome
news
hath
but
a
losing
office
and
his
tongue
sounds
ever
after
as
a
sullen
bell
rememberd
knolling
a
departing
friend
i
cannot
think
my
lord
your
son
is
dead
i
am
sorry
i
should
force
you
to
believe
that
which
i
would
to
god
i
had
not
seen
but
these
mine
eyes
saw
him
in
bloody
state
rendering
faint
quittance
wearied
and
outbreathd
to
harry
monmouth
whose
swift
wrath
beat
down
the
neverdaunted
percy
to
the
earth
from
whence
with
life
he
never
more
sprung
up
in
few
his
death
whose
spirit
lent
a
fire
even
to
the
dullest
peasant
in
his
camp
being
bruited
once
took
fire
and
heat
away
from
the
besttemperd
courage
in
his
troops
for
from
his
metal
was
his
party
steeld
which
once
in
him
abated
all
the
rest
turnd
on
themselves
like
dull
and
heavy
lead
and
as
the
thing
thats
heavy
in
itself
upon
enforcement
flies
with
greatest
speed
so
did
our
men
heavy
in
hotspurs
loss
lend
to
this
weight
such
lightness
with
their
fear
that
arrows
fled
not
swifter
toward
their
aim
than
did
our
soldiers
aiming
at
their
safety
fly
from
the
field
then
was
that
noble
worcester
too
soon
taen
prisoner
and
that
furious
scot
the
bloody
douglas
whose
welllabouring
sword
had
three
times
slain
the
appearance
of
the
king
gan
vail
his
stomach
and
did
grace
the
shame
of
those
that
turnd
their
backs
and
in
his
flight
stumbling
in
fear
was
took
the
sum
of
all
is
that
the
king
hath
won
and
hath
sent
out
a
speedy
power
to
encounter
you
my
lord
under
the
conduct
of
young
lancaster
and
westmoreland
this
is
the
news
at
full
for
this
i
shall
have
time
enough
to
mourn
in
poison
there
is
physic
and
these
news
having
been
well
that
would
have
made
me
sick
being
sick
have
in
some
measure
made
me
well
and
as
the
wretch
whose
feverweakend
joints
like
strengthless
hinges
buckle
under
life
impatient
of
his
fit
breaks
like
a
fire
out
of
his
keepers
arms
even
so
my
limbs
weakend
with
grief
being
now
enragd
with
grief
are
thrice
themselves
hence
therefore
thou
nice
crutch
a
scaly
gauntlet
now
with
joints
of
steel
must
glove
this
hand
and
hence
thou
sickly
quoif
thou
art
a
guard
too
wanton
for
the
head
which
princes
fleshd
with
conquest
aim
to
hit
now
bind
my
brows
with
iron
and
approach
the
raggedst
hour
that
time
and
spite
dare
bring
to
frown
upon
the
enragd
northumberland
let
heaven
kiss
earth
now
let
not
natures
hand
keep
the
wild
flood
confind
let
order
die
and
let
this
world
no
longer
be
a
stage
to
feed
contention
in
a
lingering
act
but
let
one
spirit
of
the
firstborn
cain
reign
in
all
bosoms
that
each
heart
being
set
on
bloody
courses
the
rude
scene
may
end
and
darkness
be
the
burier
of
the
dead
this
strained
passion
doth
you
wrong
my
lord
sweet
earl
divorce
not
wisdom
from
your
honour
the
lives
of
all
your
loving
complices
lean
on
your
health
the
which
if
you
give
oer
to
stormy
passion
must
perforce
decay
you
cast
the
event
of
war
my
noble
lord
and
summd
the
account
of
chance
before
you
said
let
us
make
head
it
was
your
presurmise
that
in
the
dole
of
blows
your
son
might
drop
you
knew
he
walkd
oer
perils
on
an
edge
more
likely
to
fall
in
than
to
get
oer
you
were
advisd
his
flesh
was
capable
of
wounds
and
scars
and
that
his
forward
spirit
would
lift
him
where
most
trade
of
danger
rangd
yet
did
you
say
go
forth
and
none
of
this
though
strongly
apprehended
could
restrain
the
stiffborne
action
what
hath
then
befallen
or
what
hath
this
bold
enterprise
brought
forth
more
than
that
being
which
was
like
to
be
we
all
that
are
engaged
to
this
loss
knew
that
we
venturd
on
such
dangerous
seas
that
if
we
wrought
out
life
twas
ten
to
one
and
yet
we
venturd
for
the
gain
proposd
chokd
the
respect
of
likely
peril
feard
and
since
we
are
oerset
venture
again
come
we
will
all
put
forth
body
and
goods
tis
more
than
time
and
my
most
noble
lord
i
hear
for
certain
and
do
speak
the
truth
the
gentle
archbishop
of
york
is
up
with
wellappointed
powers
he
is
a
man
who
with
a
double
surety
binds
his
followers
my
lord
your
son
had
only
but
the
corpse
but
shadows
and
the
shows
of
men
to
fight
for
that
same
word
rebellion
did
divide
the
action
of
their
bodies
from
their
souls
and
they
did
fight
with
queasiness
constraind
as
men
drink
potions
that
their
weapons
only
seemd
on
our
side
but
for
their
spirits
and
souls
this
word
rebellion
it
had
froze
them
up
as
fish
are
in
a
pond
but
now
the
bishop
turns
insurrection
to
religion
supposd
sincere
and
holy
in
his
thoughts
hes
followd
both
with
body
and
with
mind
and
doth
enlarge
his
rising
with
the
blood
of
fair
king
richard
scrapd
from
pomfret
stones
derives
from
heaven
his
quarrel
and
his
cause
tells
them
he
doth
bestride
a
bleeding
land
gasping
for
life
under
great
bolingbroke
and
more
and
less
do
flock
to
follow
him
i
knew
of
this
before
but
to
speak
truth
this
present
grief
had
wipd
it
from
my
mind
go
in
with
me
and
counsel
every
man
the
aptest
way
for
safety
and
revenge
get
posts
and
letters
and
make
friends
with
speed
never
so
few
and
never
yet
more
need
sirrah
you
giant
what
says
the
doctor
to
my
water
he
said
sir
the
water
itself
was
a
good
healthy
water
but
for
the
party
that
owed
it
he
might
have
more
diseases
than
he
knew
for
men
of
all
sorts
take
a
pride
to
gird
at
me
the
brain
of
this
foolishcompounded
clay
man
is
not
able
to
invent
anything
that
tends
to
laughter
more
than
i
invent
or
is
invented
on
me
i
am
not
only
witty
in
myself
but
the
cause
that
wit
is
in
other
men
i
do
here
walk
before
thee
like
a
sow
that
hath
overwhelmed
all
her
litter
but
one
if
the
prince
put
thee
into
my
service
for
any
other
reason
than
to
set
me
off
why
then
i
have
no
judgment
thou
whoreson
mandrake
thou
art
fitter
to
be
worn
in
my
cap
than
to
wait
at
my
heels
i
was
never
manned
with
an
agate
till
now
but
i
will
set
you
neither
in
gold
nor
silver
but
in
vile
apparel
and
send
you
back
again
to
your
master
for
a
jewel
the
juvenal
the
prince
your
master
whose
chin
is
not
yet
fledged
i
will
sooner
have
a
beard
grow
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
than
he
shall
get
one
on
his
cheek
and
yet
he
will
not
stick
to
say
his
face
is
a
faceroyal
god
may
finish
it
when
he
will
it
is
not
a
hair
amiss
yet
he
may
keep
it
still
as
a
faceroyal
for
a
barber
shall
never
earn
sixpence
out
of
it
and
yet
he
will
be
crowing
as
if
he
had
writ
man
ever
since
his
father
was
a
bachelor
he
may
keep
his
own
grace
but
he
is
almost
out
of
mine
i
can
assure
him
what
said
master
dombledon
about
the
satin
for
my
short
cloak
and
my
slops
he
said
sir
you
should
procure
him
better
assurance
than
bardolph
he
would
not
take
his
bond
and
yours
he
liked
not
the
security
let
him
be
damned
like
the
glutton
may
his
tongue
be
hotter
a
whoreson
achitophel
a
rascally
yeaforsooth
knave
to
bear
a
gentleman
in
hand
and
then
stand
upon
security
the
whoreson
smoothpates
do
now
wear
nothing
but
high
shoes
and
bunches
of
keys
at
their
girdles
and
if
a
man
is
thorough
with
them
in
honest
taking
up
then
they
must
stand
upon
security
i
had
as
lief
they
would
put
ratsbane
in
my
mouth
as
offer
to
stop
it
with
security
i
looked
a
should
have
sent
me
two
and
twenty
yards
of
satin
as
i
am
a
true
knight
and
he
sends
me
security
well
he
may
sleep
in
security
for
he
hath
the
horn
of
abundance
and
the
lightness
of
his
wife
shines
through
it
and
yet
cannot
he
see
though
he
have
his
own
lanthorn
to
light
him
wheres
bardolph
hes
gone
into
smithfield
to
buy
your
worship

horse

him
in
pauls

a
shame

whoreson
tingling

its
original
from

i
say
to
you
very
well
my
lord
very
well
rather
ant
please
you
it
is
the
disease
of
not
listening
the
malady
of
not
marking
that
i
am
troubled
withal
to
punish
you
by
the
heels
would
amend
the
attention
of
your
ears
and
i
care
not
if
i
do
become
your
physician
i
am
as
poor
as
job
my
lord
but
not
so
patient
your
lordship
may
minister
the
potion
of
imprisonment
to
me
in
respect
of
poverty
but
how
i
should
be
your
patient
to
follow
your
prescriptions
the
wise
may
make
some
dram
of
a
scruple
or
indeed
a
scruple
itself
i
sent
for
you
when
there
were
matters
against
you
for
your
life
to
come
speak
with
me
as
i
was
then
advised
by
my
learned
counsel
in
the
laws
of
this
landservice
i
did
not
come
well
the
truth
is
sir
john
you
live
in
great
infamy
he
that
buckles
him
in
my
belt
cannot
live
in
less
your
means
are
very
slender
and
your
waste
is
great
i
would
it
were
otherwise
i
would
my
means
were
greater
and
my
waist
slenderer
you
have
misled
the
youthful
prince
the
young
prince
hath
misled
me
i
am
the
fellow
with
the
great
belly
and
he
my
dog
well
i
am
loath
to
gall
a
newhealed
wound
your
days
service
at
shrewsbury
hath
a
little
gilded
over
your
nights
exploit
on
gadshill
you
may
thank
the
unquiet
time
for
your
quiet
oerposting
that
action
my
lord
but
since
all
is
well
keep
it
so
wake
not
a
sleeping
wolf
to
wake
a
wolf
is
as
bad
as
to
smell
a
fox
what
you
are
as
a
candle
the
better
part
burnt
out
a
wassail
candle
my
lord
all
tallow
if
i
did
say
of
wax
my
growth
would
approve
the
truth
there
is
not
a
white
hair
on
your
face
but
should
have
his
effect
of
gravity
his
effect
of
gravy
gravy
gravy
you
follow
the
young
prince
up
and
down
like
his
ill
angel
not
so
my
lord
your
ill
angel
is
light
but
i
hope
he
that
looks
upon
me
will
take
me
without
weighing
and
yet
in
some
respects
i
grant
i
cannot
go
i
cannot
tell
virtue
is
of
so
little
regard
in
these
costermonger
times
that
true
valour
is
turned
bearherd
pregnancy
is
made
a
tapster
and
hath
his
quick
wit
wasted
in
giving
reckonings
all
the
other
gifts
appertinent
to
man
as
the
malice
of
this
age
shapes
them
are
not
worth
a
gooseberry
you
that
are
old
consider
not
the
capacities
of
us
that
are
young
you
measure
the
heat
of
our
livers
with
the
bitterness
of
your
galls
and
we
that
are
in
the
vaward
of
our
youth
i
must
confess
are
wags
too
do
you
set
down
your
name
in
the
scroll
of
youth
that
are
written
down
old
with
all
the
characters
of
age
have
you
not
a
moist
eye
a
dry
hand
a
yellow
cheek
a
white
beard
a
decreasing
leg
an
increasing
belly
is
not
your
voice
broken
your
wind
short
your
chin
double
your
wit
single
and
every
part
about
you
blasted
with
antiquity
and
will
you
yet
call
yourself
young
fie
fie
fie
sir
john
my
lord
i
was
born
about
three
of
the
clock
in
the
afternoon
with
a
white
head
and
something
a
round
belly
for
my
voice
i
have
lost
it
with
hollaing
and
singing
of
anthems
to
approve
my
youth
further
i
will
not
the
truth
is
i
am
only
old
in
judgment
and
understanding
and
he
that
will
caper
with
me
for
a
thousand
marks
let
him
lend
me
the
money
and
have
at
him
for
the
box
o
the
ear
that
the
prince
gave
you
he
gave
it
like
a
rude
prince
and
you
took
it
like
a
sensible
lord
i
have
checked
him
for
it
and
the
young
lion
repents
marry
not
in
ashes
and
sackcloth
but
in
new
silk
and
old
sack
well
god
send
the
prince
a
better
companion
god
send
the
companion
a
better
prince
i
cannot
rid
my
hands
of
him
well
the
king
hath
severed
you
and
prince
harry
i
hear
you
are
going
with
lord
john
of
lancaster
against
the
archbishop
and
the
earl
of
northumberland
yea
i
thank
your
pretty
sweet
wit
for
it
but
look
you
pray
all
you
that
kiss
my
lady
peace
at
home
that
our
armies
join
not
in
a
hot
day
for
by
the
lord
i
take
but
two
shirts
out
with
me
and
i
mean
not
to
sweat
extraordinarily
if
it
be
a
hot
day
and
i
brandish
anything
but
my
bottle
i
would
i
might
never
spit
white
again
there
is
not
a
dangerous
action
can
peep
out
his
head
but
i
am
thrust
upon
it
well
i
cannot
last
ever
but
it
was
always
yet
the
trick
of
our
english
nation
if
they
have
a
good
thing
to
make
it
too
common
if
you
will
needs
say
i
am
an
old
man
you
should
give
me
rest
i
would
to
god
my
name
were
not
so
terrible
to
the
enemy
as
it
is
i
were
better
to
be
eaten
to
death
with
rust
than
to
be
scoured
to
nothing
with
perpetual
motion
well
be
honest
be
honest
and
god
bless
your
expedition
will
your
lordship
lend
me
a
thousand
pound
to
furnish
me
forth
not
a
penny
not
a
penny
you
are
too
impatient
to
bear
crosses
fare
you
well
commend
me
to
my
cousin
westmoreland
if
i
do
fillip
me
with
a
threeman
beetle
a
man
can
no
more
separate
age
and
covetousness
than
he
can
part
young
limbs
and
lechery
but
the
gout
galls
the
one
and
the
pox
pinches
the
other
and
so
both
the
degrees
prevent
my
curses
boy
sir
what
money
is
in
my
purse
seven
groats
and
twopence
i
can
get
no
remedy
against
this
consumption
of
the
purse
borrowing
only
lingers
and
lingers
it
out
but
the
disease
is
incurable
go
bear
this
letter
to
my
lord
of
lancaster
this
to
the
prince
this
to
the
earl
of
westmoreland
and
this
to
old
mistress
ursula
whom
i
have
weekly
sworn
to
marry
since
i
perceived
the
first
white
hair
on
my
chin
about
it
you
know
where
to
find
me
a
pox
of
this
gout
or
a
gout
of
this
pox
for
the
one
or
the
other
plays
the
rogue
with
my
great
toe
tis
no
matter
if
i
do
halt
i
have
the
wars
for
my
colour
and
my
pension
shall
seem
the
more
reasonable
a
good
wit
will
make
use
of
anything
i
will
turn
diseases
to
commodity
thus
have
you
heard
our
cause
and
known
our
means
and
my
most
noble
friends
i
pray
you
all
speak
plainly
your
opinions
of
our
hopes
and
first
lord
marshal
what
say
you
to
it
i
well
allow
the
occasion
of
our
arms
but
gladly
would
be
better
satisfied
how
in
our
means
we
should
advance
ourselves
to
look
with
forehead
bold
and
big
enough
upon
the
power
and
puissance
of
the
king
our
present
musters
grow
upon
the
file
to
fiveandtwenty
thousand
men
of
choice
and
our
supplies
live
largely
in
the
hope
of
great
northumberland
whose
bosom
burns
with
an
incensed
fire
of
injuries
the
question
then
lord
hastings
standeth
thus
whether
our
present
fiveandtwenty
thousand
may
hold
up
head
without
northumberland
with
him
we
may
ay
marry
theres
the
point
but
if
without
him
we
be
thought
too
feeble
my
judgment
is
we
should
not
step
too
far
till
we
had
his
assistance
by
the
hand
for
in
a
theme
so
bloodyfaod
as
this
conjecture
expectation
and
surmise
of
aids
incertain
should
not
be
admitted
tis
very
true
lord
bardolph
for
indeed
it
was
young
hotspurs
case
at
shrewsbury
it
was
my
lord
who
lind
himself
with
hope
eating
the
air
on
promise
of
supply
flattering
himself
with
project
of
a
power
much
smaller
than
the
smallest
of
his
thoughts
and
so
with
great
imagination
proper
to
madmen
led
his
powers
to
death
and
winking
leapd
into
destruction
but
by
your
leave
it
never
yet
did
hurt
to
lay
down
likelihoods
and
forms
of
hope
yes
if
this
present
quality
of
war
indeed
the
instant
action
a
cause
on
foot
lives
so
in
hope
as
in
an
early
spring
we
see
the
appearing
buds
which
to
prove
fruit
hope
gives
not
so
much
warrant
as
despair
that
frosts
will
bite
them
when
we
mean
to
build
we
first
survey
the
plot
then
draw
the
model
and
when
we
see
the
figure
of
the
house
then
must
we
rate
the
cost
of
the
erection
which
if
we
find
outweighs
ability
what
do
we
then
but
draw
anew
the
model
in
fewer
offices
or
at
last
desist
to
build
at
all
much
more
in
this
great
work
which
is
almost
to
pluck
a
kingdom
down
and
set
another
up
should
we
survey
the
plot
of
situation
and
the
model
consent
upon
a
sure
foundation
question
surveyors
know
our
own
estate
how
able
such
a
work
to
undergo
to
weigh
against
his
opposite
or
else
we
fortify
in
paper
and
in
figures
using
the
names
of
men
instead
of
men
like
one
that
draws
the
model
of
a
house
beyond
his
power
to
build
it
who
half
through
gives
oer
and
leaves
his
partcreated
cost
a
nakedsubject
to
the
weeping
clouds
and
waste
for
churlish
winters
tyranny
grant
that
our
hopes
yet
likely
of
fair
birth
should
be
stillborn
and
that
we
now
possessd
the
utmost
man
of
expectation
i
think
we
are
a
body
strong
enough
even
as
we
are
to
equal
with
the
king
what
is
the
king
but
fiveandtwenty
thousand
to
us
no
more
nay
not
so
much
lord
bardolph
for
his
divisions
as
the
times
do
brawl
are
in
three
heads
one
power
against
the
french
and
one
against
glendower
perforce
a
third
must
take
up
us
so
is
the
unfirm
king
in
three
divided
and
his
coffers
sound
with
hollow
poverty
and
emptiness
that
he
should
draw
his
several
strengths
together
and
come
against
us
in
full
puissance
need
not
be
dreaded
if
he
should
do
so
he
leaves
his
back
unarmd
the
french
and
welsh
baying
him
at
the
heels
never
fear
that
who
is
it
like
should
lead
his
forces
hither
the
duke
of
lancaster
and
westmoreland
against
the
welsh
himself
and
harry
monmouth
but
who
is
substituted
gainst
the
french
i
have
no
certain
notice
let
us
on
and
publish
the
occasion
of
our
arms
the
commonwealth
is
sick
of
their
own
choice
their
overgreedy
love
hath
surfeited
a
habitation
giddy
and
unsure
hath
he
that
buildeth
on
the
vulgar
heart
o
thou
fond
many
with
what
loud
applause
didst
thou
beat
heaven
with
blessing
bolingbroke
before
he
was
what
thou
wouldst
have
him
be
and
being
now
trimmd
in
thine
own
desires
thou
beastly
feeder
art
so
full
of
him
that
thou
provokst
thyself
to
cast
him
up
so
so
thou
common
dog
didst
thou
disgorge
thy
glutton
bosom
of
the
royal
richard
and
now
thou
wouldst
eat
thy
dead
vomit
up
and
howlst
to
find
it
what
trust
is
in
these
times
they
that
when
richard
livd
would
have
him
die
are
now
become
enamourd
on
his
grave
thou
that
threwst
dust
upon
his
goodly
head
when
through
proud
london
he
came
sighing
on
after
the
admired
heels
of
bolingbroke
cryst
now
o

yield
us
that
king

thee
thou

a
great
fool
before
god
i
am
exceeding
weary
is
it
come
to
that
i
had
thought
weariness
durst
not
have
attached
one
of
so
high
blood
faith
it
does
me
though
it
discolours
the
complexion
of
my
greatness
to
acknowledge
it
doth
it
not
show
vilely
in
me
to
desire
small
beer
why
a
prince
should
not
be
so
loosely
studied
as
to
remember
so
weak
a
composition
belike
then
my
appetite
was
not
princely
got
for
by
my
troth
i
do
now
remember
the
poor
creature
small
beer
but
indeed
these
humble
considerations
make
me
out
of
love
with
my
greatness
what
a
disgrace
is
it
to
me
to
remember
thy
name
or
to
know
thy
face
tomorrow
or
to
take
note
how
many
pair
of
silk
stockings
thou
hast
viz
these
and
those
that
were
thy
peachcoloured
ones
or
to
bear
the
inventory
of
thy
shirts
as
one
for
superfluity
and
one
other
for
use
but
that
the
tenniscourtkeeper
knows
better
than
i
for
it
is
a
low
ebb
of
linen
with
thee
when
thou
keepest
not
racket
there
as
thou
hast
not
done
a
great
while
because
the
rest
of
thy
lowcountries
have
made
a
shift
to
eat
up
thy
holland
and
god
knows
whether
those
that
bawl
out
the
ruins
of
thy
linen
shall
inherit
his
kingdom
but
the
midwives
say
the
children
are
not
in
the
fault
whereupon
the
world
increases
and
kindreds
are
mightily
strengthened
how
ill
it
follows
after
you
have
laboured
so
hard
you
should
talk
so
idly
tell
me
how
many
good
young
princes
would
do
so
their
fathers
being
so
sick
as
yours
at
this
time
is
shall
i
tell
thee
one
thing
poins
yes
faith
and
let
it
be
an
excellent
good
thing
it
shall
serve
among
wits
of
no
higher
breeding
than
thine
go
to
i
stand
the
push
of
your
one
thing
that
you
will
tell
marry
i
tell
thee
it
is
not
meet
that
i
should
be
sad
now
my
father
is
sick
albeit
i
could
tell
to
thee
as
to
one
it
pleases
me
for
fault
of
a
better
to
call
my
friend
i
could
be
sad
and
sad
indeed
too
very
hardly
upon
such
a
subject
by
this
hand
thou
thinkest
me
as
far
in
the
devils
book
as
thou
and
falstaff
for
obduracy
and
persistency
let
the
end
try
the
man
but
i
tell
thee
my
heart
bleeds
inwardly
that
my
father
is
so
sick
and
keeping
such
vile
company
as
thou
art
hath
in
reason
taken
from
me
all
ostentation
of
sorrow
the
reason
what
wouldst
thou
think
of
me
if
i
should
weep
i
would
think
thee
a
most
princely
hypocrite
it
would
be
every
mans
thought
and
thou
art
a
blessed
fellow
to
think
as
every
man
thinks
never
a
mans
thought
in
the
world
keeps
the
roadway
better
than
thine
every
man
would
think
me
a
hypocrite
indeed
and
what
accites
your
most
worshipful
thought
to
think
so
why
because
you
have
been
so
lewd
and
so
much
engraffed
to
falstaff
and
to
thee
by
this
light
i
am
well
spoke
on
i
can
hear
it
with
mine
own
ears
the
worst
that
they
can
say
of
me
is
that
i
am
a
second
brother
and
that
i
am
a
proper
fellow
of
my
hands
and
these
two
things
i
confess
i
cannot
help
by
the
mass
here
comes
bardolph
and
the
boy
that
i
gave
falstaff
a
had
him
from
me
christian
and
look
if
the
fat
villain
have
not
transformed
him
ape
god
save
your
grace
and
yours
most
noble
bardolph
come
you
virtuous
ass
you
bashful
fool
must
you
be
blushing
wherefore
blush
you
now
what
a
maidenly
manatarms
are
you
become
is
it
such
a
matter
to
get
a
pottlepots
maidenhead
a
calls
me
even
now
my
lord
through
a
red
lattice
and
i
could
discern
no
part
of
his
face
from
the
window
at
last
i
spied
his
eyes
and
methought
he
had
made
two
holes
in
the
alewifes
new
petticoat
and
peeped
through
hath
not
the
boy
profited
away
you
whoreson
upright
rabbit
away

you
rascally
altheas
dream
away
instruct
us
boy
what
dream
boy

my
lord
althea
dreamed
she
was
delivered
of
a
firebrand
and
therefore

call
him
her
dream
a
crowns
worth
of
good
interpretation
there
it
is
boy
o
that
this
good
blossom
could
be
kept
from
cankers

good
respect
and
how
doth
the
martlemas
your
master
in
bodily
health

marry
the
immortal
part

a
physician
but
that
moves
not
him
though

sick
it
dies
not
i
do
allow
this
wen
to
be
as
familiar
with
me
as
my
dog
and
he
holds
his
place
for
look
you
how
he
writes
john
falstaff
knight
every
man
must
know
that
as
oft
as
he
has
occasion
to
name
himself
even
like
those
that
are
akin
to
the
king
for
they
never
prick
their
finger
but
they
say
there
is
some
of
the
kings
blood
spilt
how
comes
that
says
he
that
takes
upon
him
not
to
conceive
the
answer
is
as
ready
as
a
borrowers
cap

low
transformation

the
times
and

percy
troublesome
i
have
given

i
will
speak
no
more
do
what
you
will
your
wisdom
be
your
guide
alas
sweet
wife
my
honour
is
at
pawn
and
but
my
going
nothing
can
redeem
it
o
yet
for
gods
sake
go
not
to
these
wars
the
time
was
father
that
you
broke
your
word
when
you
were
more
endeard
to
it
than
now
when
your
own
percy
when
my
hearts
dear
harry
threw
many
a
northward
look
to
see
his
father
bring
up
his
powers
but
he
did
long
in
vain
who
then
persuaded
you
to
stay
at
home
there
were
two
honours
lost
yours
and
your
sons
for
yours
the
god
of
heaven
brighten
it
for
his
it
stuck
upon
him
as
the
sun
in
the
grey
vault
of
heaven
and
by
his
light
did
all
the
chivalry
of
england
move
to
do
brave
acts
he
was
indeed
the
glass
wherein
the
noble
youth
did
dress
themselves
he
had
no
legs
that
practisd
not
his
gait
and
speaking
thick
which
nature
made
his
blemish
became
the
accents
of
the
valiant
for
those
that
could
speak
low
and
tardily
would
turn
their
own
perfection
to
abuse
to
seem
like
him
so
that
in
speech
in
gait
in
diet
in
affections
of
delight
in
military
rules
humours
of
blood
he
was
the
mark
and
glass
copy
and
book
that
fashiond
others
and
him
o
wondrous
him
o
miracle
of
men
him
did
you
leave
second
to
none
unseconded
by
you
to
look
upon
the
hideous
god
of
war
in
disadvantage
to
abide
a
field
where
nothing
but
the
sound
of
hotspurs
name
did
seem
defensible
so
you
left
him
never
o
never
do
his
ghost
the
wrong
to
hold
your
honour
more
precise
and
nice
with
others
than
with
him
let
them
alone
the
marshal
and
the
archbishop
are
strong
had
my
sweet
harry
had
but
half
their
numbers
today
might
i
hanging
on
hotspurs
neck
have
talkd
of
monmouths
grave
beshrew
your
heart
fair
daughter
you
do
draw
my
spirits
from
me
with
new
lamenting
ancient
oversights
but
i
must
go
and
meet
with
danger
there
or
it
will
seek
me
in
another
place
and
find
me
worse
provided
o
fly
to
scotland
till
that
the
nobles
and
the
armed
commons
have
of
their
puissance
made
a
little
taste
if
they
get
ground
and
vantage
of
the
king
then
join
you
with
them
like
a
rib
of
steel
to
make
strength
stronger
but
for
all
our
loves
first
let
them
try
themselves
so
did
your
son
he
was
so
sufferd
so
came
i
a
widow
and
never
shall
have
length
of
life
enough
to
rain
upon
remembrance
with
mine
eyes
that
it
may
grow
and
sprout
as
high
as
heaven
for
recordation
to
my
noble
husband
come
come
go
in
with
me
tis
with
my
mind
as
with
the
tide
swelld
up
unto
its
height
that
makes
a
stillstand
running
neither
way
fain
would
i
go
to
meet
the
archbishop
but
many
thousand
reasons
hold
me
back
i
will
resolve
for
scotland
there
am
i
till
time
and
vantage
crave
my
company
what
the
devil
hast
thou
brought

soft
nurse
how
have
i
frighted
thee
that
thou
no
more
wilt
weigh
my
eyelids
down
and
steep
my
senses
in
forgetfulness
why
rather
sleep
liest
thou
in
smoky
cribs
upon
uneasy
pallets
stretching
thee
and
hushd
with
buzzing
nightflies
to
thy
slumber
than
in
the
perfumd
chambers
of
the
great
under
the
canopies
of
costly
state
and
lulld
with
sound
of
sweetest
melody
o
thou
dull
god
why
liest
thou
with
the
vile
in
loathsome
beds
and
leavst
the
kingly
couch
a
watchcase
or
a
common
larum
bell
wilt
thou
upon
the
high
and
giddy
mast
seel
up
the
shipboys
eyes
and
rock
his
brains
in
cradle
of
the
rude
imperious
surge
and
in
the
visitation
of
the
winds
who
take
the
ruffian
billows
by
the
top
curling
their
monstrous
heads
and
hanging
them
with
deafning
clamour
in
the
slippery
clouds
that
with
the
hurly
death
itself
awakes
canst
thou
o
partial
sleep
give
thy
repose
to
the
wet
seaboy
in
an
hour
so
rude
and
in
the
calmest
and
most
stillest
night
with
all
appliances
and
means
to
boot
deny
it
to
a
king
then
happy
low
lie
down
uneasy
lies
the
head
that
wears
a
crown
many
good
morrows
to
your
majesty
is
it
good
morrow
lords
tis
one
oclock
and
past
why
then
good
morrow
to
you
all
my
lords
have
you
read
oer
the
letters
that
i
sent
you
we
have
my
liege
then
you
perceive
the
body
of
our
kingdom
how
foul
it
is
what
rank
diseases
grow
and
with
what
danger
near
the
heart
of
it
it
is
but
as
a
body
yet
distemperd
which
to
his
former
strength
may
be
restord
with
good
advice
and
little
medicine
my
lord
northumberland
will
soon
be
coold
o
god
that
one
might
read
the
book
of
fate
and
see
the
revolution
of
the
times
make
mountains
level
and
the
continent
weary
of
solid
firmness
melt
itself
into
the
sea
and
other
times
to
see
the
beachy
girdle
of
the
ocean
too
wide
for
neptunes
hips
how
chances
mock
and
changes
fill
the
cup
of
alteration
with
divers
liquors
o
if
this
were
seen
the
happiest
youth
viewing
his
progress
through
what
perils
past
what
crosses
to
ensue
would
shut
the
book
and
sit
him
down
and
die
tis
not
ten
years
gone
since
richard
and
northumberland
great
friends
did
feast
together
and
in
two
years
after
were
they
at
wars
it
is
but
eight
years
since
this
percy
was
the
man
nearest
my
soul
who
like
a
brother
toild
in
my
affairs
and
laid
his
love
and
life
under
my
foot
yea
for
my
sake
even
to
the
eyes
of
richard
gave
him
defiance
but
which
of
you
was
by
you
cousin
nevil
as
i
may
remember
when
richard
with
his
eye
brimful
of
tears
then
checkd
and
rated
by
northumberland
did
speak
these
words
now
provd
a
prophecy
northumberland
thou
ladder
by
the
which
my
cousin
bolingbroke
ascends
my
throne
though
then
god
knows
i
had
no
such
intent
but
that
necessity
so
bowd
the
state
that
i
and
greatness
were
compelled
to
kiss
the
time
shall
come
thus
did
he
follow
it
the
time
will
come
that
foul
sin
gathering
head
shall
break
into
corruption
so
went
on
foretelling
this
same
times
condition
and
the
division
of
our
amity
there
is
a
history
in
all
mens
lives
figuring
the
nature
of
the
times
deceasd
the
which
observd
a
man
may
prophesy
with
a
near
aim
of
the
main
chance
of
things
as
yet
not
come
to
life
which
in
their
seeds
and
weak
leginnings
lie
intreasured
such
things
become
the
hatch
and
brood
of
time
and
by
the
necessary
form
of
this
king
richard
might
create
a
perfect
guess
that
great
northumberland
then
false
to
him
would
of
that
seed
grow
to
a
greater
falseness
which
should
not
find
a
ground
to
root
upon
unless
on
you
are
these
things
then
necessities
then
let
us
meet
them
like
necessities
and
that
same
word
even
now
cries
out
on
us
they
say
the
bishop
and
northumberland
are
fifty
thousand
strong
it
cannot
be
my
lord
rumour
doth
double
like
the
voice
and
echo
the
numbers
of
the
feard
please
it
your
grace
to
go
to
bed
upon
my
soul
my
lord

powers
that
you
already
have
sent

do

the
bottom
of
justice
shallow
lord
lord
how
subject
we
old
men
are
to
this
vice
of
lying
this
same
starved
justice
hath
done
nothing
but
prate
to
me
of
the
wildness
of
his
youth
and
the
feats
he
hath
done
about
turnbull
street
and
every
third
word
a
lie
duer
paid
to
the
hearer
than
the
turks
tribute
i
do
remember
him
at
clements
inn
like
a
man
made
after
supper
of
a
cheeseparing
when
a
was
naked
he
was
for
all
the
world
like
a
forked
radish
with
a
head
fantastically
carved
upon
it
with
a
knife
a
was
so
forlorn
that
his
dimensions
to
any
thick
sight
were
invincible
a
was
the
very
genius
of
famine
yet
lecherous
as
a
monkey
and
the
whores
called
him
mandrake
a
came
ever
in
the
rearward
of
the
fashion
and
sung
those
tunes
to
the
overscutched
huswives
that
he
heard
the
carmen
whistle
and
sware
they
were
his
fancies
or
his
goodnights
and
now
is
this
vices
dagger
become
a
squire
and
talks
as
familiarly
of
john
a
gaunt
as
if
he
had
been
sworn
brother
to
him
and
ill
be
sworn
a
never
saw
him
but
once
in
the
tiltyard
and
then
he
burst
his
head
for
crowding
among
the
marshals
men
i
saw
it
and
told
john
a
gaunt
he
beat
his
own
name
for
you
might
have
thrust
him
and
all
his
apparel
into
an
eelskin
the
case
of
a
treble
hautboy
was
a
mansion
for
him
a
court
and
now
has
he
land
and
beefs
well
i
will
be
acquainted
with
him
if
i
return
and
it
shall
go
hard
but
i
will
make
him
a
philosophers
two
stones
to
me
if
the
young
dace
be
a
bait
for
the
old
pike
i
see
no
reason
in
the
law
of
nature
but
i
may
snap
at
him
let
time
shape
and
there
an
end
what
is
this
forest
calld
tis
gaultree
forest
ant
shall
please
your
grace
here
stand
my
lords
and
send
discovers
forth
to
know
the
numbers
of
our
enemies
we
have
sent
forth
already
tis
well
done
my
friends
and
brethren
in
these
great
affairs
i
must
acquaint
you
that
i
have
receivd
newdated
letters
from
northumberland
their
cold
intent
tenour
and
substance
thus
here
doth
he
wish
his
person
with
such
powers
as
might
hold
sortance
with
his
quality
the
which
he
could
not
levy
whereupon
he
is
retird
to
ripe
his
growing
fortunes
to
scotland
and
concludes
in
hearty
prayers
that
your
attempts
may
overlive
the
hazard
and
fearful
meeting
of
their
opposite
thus
do
the
hopes
we
have
in
him
touch
ground
and
dash
themselves
to
pieces
now
what
news
west
of
this
forest
scarcely
off
a
mile
in
goodly
form
comes
on
the
enemy
and
by
the
ground
they
hide
i
judge
their
number
upon
or
near
the
rate
of
thirty
thousand
the
just
proportion
that
we
gave
them
out
let
us
sway
on
and
face
them
in
the
field
what
wellappointed
leader
fronts
us
here
i
think
it
is
my
lord
of
westmoreland
health
and
fair
greeting
from
our
general
the
prince
lord
john
and
duke
of
lancaster
say
on
my
lord
of
westmoreland
in
peace
what
doth
concern
your
coming
then
my
lord
unto
your
grace
do
i
in
chief
address
the
substance
of
my
speech
if
that
rebellion
came
like
itself
in
base
and
abject
routs
led
on
by
bloody
youth
guarded
with
rags
and
countenancd
by
boys
and
beggary
i
say
if
damnd
commotion
so
appeard
in
his
true
native
and
most
proper
shape
you
reverend
father
and
these
noble
lords
had
not
been
here
to
dress
the
ugly
form
of
base
and
bloody
insurrection
with
your
fair
honours
you
lord
archbishop
whose
see
is
by
a
civil
peace
maintaind
whose
beard
the
silver
hand
of
peace
hath
touchd
whose
learning
and
good
letters
peace
hath
tutord
whose
white
investments
figure
innocence
the
dove
and
very
blessed
spirit
of
peace
wherefore
do
you
so
ill
translate
yourself
out
of
the
speech
of
peace
that
bears
such
grace
into
the
harsh
and
boisterous
tongue
of
war
turning
your
books
to
greaves
your
ink
to
blood
your
pens
to
lances
and
your
tongue
divine
to
a
loud
trumpet
and
a
point
of
war
wherefore
do
i
this
so
the
question
stands
briefly
to
this
end
we
are
all
diseasd
and
with
our
surfeiting
and
wanton
hours
have
brought
ourselves
into
a
burning
fever
and
we
must
bleed
for
it
of
which
disease
our
late
king
richard
being
infected
died
but
my
most
noble
lord
of
westmoreland
i
take
not
on
me
here
as
a
physician
nor
do
i
as
an
enemy
to
peace
troop
in
the
throngs
of
military
men
but
rather
show
a
while
like
fearful
war
to
diet
rank
minds
sick
of
happiness
and
purge
the
obstructions
which
begin
to
stop
our
very
veins
of
life
hear
me
more
plainly
i
have
in
equal
balance
justly
weighd
what
wrongs
our
arms
may
do
what
wrongs
we
suffer
and
find
our
griefs
heavier
than
our
offences
we
see
which
way
the
stream
of
time
doth
run
and
are
enforcd
from
our
most
quiet
sphere
by
the
rough
torrent
of
occasion
and
have
the
summary
of
all
our
griefs
when
time
shall
serve
to
show
in
articles
which
long
ere
this
we
offerd
to
the
king
and
might
by
no
suit
gain
our
audience
when
we
are
wrongd
and
would
unfold
our
griefs
we
are
denied
access
unto
his
person
even
by
those
men
that
most
have
done
us
wrong
the
dangers
of
the
days
but
newly
gone
whose
memory
is
written
on
the
earth
with
yet
appearing
blood
and
the
examples
of
every
minutes
instance
present
now
have
put
us
in
these
illbeseeming
arms
not
to
break
peace
or
any
branch
of
it
but
to
establish
here
a
peace
indeed
concurring
both
in
name
and
quality
when
ever
yet
was
your
appeal
denied
wherein
have
you
been
galled
by
the
king
what
peer
hath
been
subornd
to
grate
on
you
that
you
should
seal
this
lawless
bloody
book
of
forgd
rebellion
with
a
seal
divine
and
consecrate
commotions
bitter
edge
my
brother
general
the
commonwealth
to
brother
born
an
household
cruelty
i
make
my
quarrel
in
particular
there
is
no
need
of
any
such
redress
or
if
there
were
it
not
belongs
to
you
why
not
to
him
in
part
and
to
us
all
that
feel
the
bruises
of
the
days
before
and
suffer
the
condition
of
these
times
to
lay
a
heavy
and
unequal
hand
upon
our
honours
o
my
good
lord
mowbray
construe
the
times
to
their
necessities
and
you
shall
say
indeed
it
is
the
time
and
not
the
king
that
doth
you
injuries
yet
for
your
part
it
not
appears
to
me
either
from
the
king
or
in
the
present
time
that
you
should
have
an
inch
of
any
ground
to
build
a
grief
on
were
you
not
restord
to
all
the
duke
of
norfolks
signories
your
noble
and
right
wellrememberd
fathers
what
thing
in
honour
had
my
father
lost
that
need
to
be
revivd
and
breathd
in
me
the
king
that
lovd
him
as
the
state
stood
then
was
force
perforce
compelld
to
banish
him
and
then
that
harry
bolingbroke
and
he
being
mounted
and
both
roused
in
their
seats
their
neighing
coursers
daring
of
the
spur
their
armed
staves
in
charge
their
beavers
down
their
eyes
of
fire
sparkling
through
sights
of
steel
and
the
loud
trumpet
blowing
them
together
then
then
when
there
was
nothing
could
have
stayd
my
father
from
the
breast
of
bolingbroke
o
when
the
king
did
throw
his
warder
down
his
own
life
hung
upon
the
staff
he
threw
then
threw
he
down
himself
and
all
their
lives
that
by
indictment
and
by
dint
of
sword
have
since
miscarried
under
bolingbroke
you
speak
lord
mowbray
now
you
know
not
what
the
earl
of
hereford
was
reputed
then
in
england
the
most
valiant
gentleman
who
knows
on
whom
fortune
would
then
have
smild
but
if
your
father
had
been
victor
there
he
neer
had
borne
it
out
of
coventry
for
all
the
country
in
a
general
voice
cried
hate
upon
him
and
all
their
prayers
and
love
were
set
on
hereford
whom
they
doted
on
and
blessd
and
gracd
indeed
more
than
the
king
but
this
is
mere
digression
from
my
purpose
here
come
i
from
our
princely
general
to
know
your
griefs
to
tell
you
from
his
grace
that
he
will
give
you
audience
and
wherein
it
shall
appear
that
your
demands
are
just
you
shall
enjoy
them
every
thing
set
off
that
might
so
much
as
think
you
enemies
but
he
hath
forcd
us
to
compel
this
offer
and
it
proceeds
from
policy
not
love
mowbray
you
overween
to
take
it
so
this
offer
comes
from
mercy
not
from
fear
for
lo
within
a
ken
our
army
lies
upon
mine
honour
all
too
confident
to
give
admittance
to
a
thought
of
fear
our
battle
is
more
full
of
names
than
yours
our
men
more
perfect
in
the
use
of
arms
our
armour
all
as
strong
our
cause
the
best
then
reason
will
our
hearts
should
be
as
good
say
you
not
then
our
offer
is
compelld
well
by
my
will
we
shall
admit
no
parley
that
argues
but
the
shame
of
your
offence
a
rotten
case
abides
no
handling
hath
the
prince
john
a
full
commission
in
very
ample
virtue
of
his
father
to
hear
and
absolutely
to
determine
of
what
conditions
we
shall
stand
upon
that
is
intended
in
the
generals
name
i
muse
you
make
so
slight
a
question
then
take
my
lord
of
westmoreland
this
schedule
for
this
contains
our
general
grievances
each
several
article
herein
redressd
all
members
of
our
cause
both
here
and
hence
that
are
insinewd
to
this
action
acquitted
by
a
true
substantial
form
and
present
execution
of
our
wills
to
us
and
to
our
purposes
consignd
we
come
within
our
awful
banks
again
and
knit
our
powers
to
the
arm
of
peace
this
will
i
show
the
general
please
you
lords
in
sight
of
both
our
battles
we
may
meet
and
either
end
in
peace
which
god
so
frame
or
to
the
place
of
difference
call
the
swords
which
must
decide
it
my
lord
we
will
do
so
there
is
a
thing
within
my
bosom
tells
me
that
no
conditions
of
our
peace
can
stand
fear
you
not
that
if
we
can
make
our
peace
upon
such
large
terms
and
so
absolute
as
our
condition
shall
consist
upon
our
peace
shall
stand
as
firm
as
rocky
mountains
yea
but
our
valuation
shall
be
such
that
every
slight
and
falsederived
cause
yea
every
idle
nice
and
wanton
reason
shall
to
the
king
taste
of
this
action
that
were
our
royal
faiths
martyrs
in
love
we
shall
be
winnowd
with
so
rough
a
wind
that
even
our
corn
shall
seem
as
light
as
chaff
and
good
from
bad
find
no
partition
no
no
my
lord
note
this
the
king
is
weary
of
dainty
and
such
picking
grievances
for
he
hath
found
to
end
one
doubt
by
death
revives
two
greater
in
the
heirs
of
life
and
therefore
will
he
wipe
his
tables
clean
and
keep
no
telltale
to
his
memory
that
may
repeat
and
history
his
loss
to
new
remembrance
for
full
well
he
knows
he
cannot
so
precisely
weed
this
land
as
his
misdoubts
present
occasion
his
foes
are
so
enrooted
with
his
friends
that
plucking
to
unfix
an
enemy
he
doth
unfasten
so
and
shake
a
friend
so
that
this
land
like
an
offensive
wife
that
hath
enragd
him
on
to
offer
strokes
as
he
is
striking
holds
his
infant
up
and
hangs
resolvd
correction
in
the
arm
that
was
upreard
to
execution
besides
the
king
hath
wasted
all
his
rods
on
late
offenders
that
he
now
doth
lack
the
very
instruments
of
chastisement
so
that
his
power
like
to
a
fangless
lion
may
offer
but
not
hold
tis
very
true
and
therefore
be
assurd
my
good
lord
marshal
if
we
do
now
make
our

with

when

your
flock
assembled
by
the
bell
encircled
you
to
hear
with
reverence
your
exposition
on
the
holy
text
than
now
to
see
you
here
an
iron
man
cheering
a
rout
of
rebels
with
your
drum
turning
the
word
to
sword
and
life
to
death
that
man
that
sits
within
a
monarchs
heart
and
ripens
in
the
sunshine
of
his
favour
would
he
abuse
the
countenance
of
the
king
alack
what
mischief
might
he
set
abroach
in
shadow
of
such
greatness
with
you
lord
bishop
it
is
even
so
who
hath
not
heard
it
spoken
how
deep
you
were
within
the
books
of
god
to
us
the
speaker
in
his
parliament
to
us
the
imagind
voice
of
god
himself
the
very
opener
and
intelligencer
between
the
grace
the
sanctities
of
heaven
and
our
dull
workings
o
who
shall
believe
but
you
misuse
the
reverence
of
your
place
employ
the
countenance
and
grace
of
heaven
as
a
false
favourite
doth
his
princes
name
in
deeds
dishonourable
you
have
taken
up
under
the
counterfeited
zeal
of
god
the
subjects
of
his
substitute
my
father
and
both
against
the
peace
of
heaven
and
him
have
here
upswarmd
them
good
my
lord
of
lancaster
i
am
not
here
against
your
fathers
peace
but
as
i
told
my
lord
of
westmoreland
the
time
misorderd
doth
in
common
sense
crowd
us
and
crush
us
to
this
monstrous
form
to
hold
our
safety
up
i
sent
your
grace
the
parcels
and
particulars
of
our
grief
the
which
hath
been
with
scorn
shovd
from
the
court
whereon
this
hydra
son
of
war
is
born
whose
dangerous
eyes
may
well
be
charmd
asleep
with
grant
of
our
most
just
and
right
desires
and
true
obedience
of
this
madness
curd
stoop
tamely
to
the
foot
of
majesty
if
not
we
ready
are
to
try
our
fortunes
to
the
last
man
and
though
we
here
fall
down
we
have
supplies
to
second
our
attempt
if
they
miscarry
theirs
shall
second
them
and
so
success
of
mischief
shall
be
born
and
heir
from
heir
shall
hold
this
quarrel
up
whiles
england
shall
have
generation
you
are
too
shallow
hastings
much
too
shallow
to
sound
the
bottom
of
the
aftertimes
pleaseth
your
grace
to
answer
them
directly
how
far
forth
you
do
like
their
articles
i
like
them
all
and
do
allow
them
well
and
swear
here
by
the
honour
of
my
blood
my
fathers
purposes
have
been
mistook
and
some
about
him
have
too
lavishly
wrested
his
meaning
and
authority

lord
these
griefs
shall
be
with
speed
redressd
upon
my
soul

good
thing

word
of
peace
is
renderd
hark
how
they
shout
this
had
been
cheerful
after
victory

party
loser

tricks
of
yours

on

life
one
time
or
other
break
some
gallows
back
i
would
be
sorry
my
lord
but
it
should
be
thus
i
never
knew
yet
but
rebuke
and
check
was
the
reward
of
valour
do
you
think
me
a
swallow
an
arrow
or
a
bullet
have
i
in
my
poor
and
old
motion
the
expedition
of
thought
i
have
speeded
hither
with
the
very
extremest
inch
of
possibility
i
have
foundered
nine
score
and
odd
posts
and
here
traveltainted
as
i
am
have
in
my
pure
and
immaculate
valour
taken
sir
john
colevile
of
the
dale
a
most
furious
knight
and
valorous
enemy
but
what
of
that
he
saw
me
and
yielded
that
i
may
justly
say
with
the
hooknosed
fellow
of
rome
i
came
saw
and
overcame
it
was
more
of
his
courtesy
than
your
deserving
i
know
not
here
he
is
and
here
i
yield
him
and
i
beseech
your
grace
let
it
be
booked
with
the
rest
of
this
days
deeds
or
by
the
lord
i
will
have
it
in
a
particular
ballad

with
mine
own
picture
on
the
top
ont
colevile
kissing
my
foot
to
the
which
course

i
be
enforced

and
i
in
the
clear
sky
of

much
as

doth
the
cinders
of
the
element
which
show
like
pins
heads

the
word
of

noble
therefore
let
me
have
right
and
let
desert
mount
thines
too
heavy
to
mount
let
it
shine
then
thines
too
thick
to
shine
let

do
something
my
good
lord
that

good
and
call

what
you
will

thy
name

famous
rebel

thou
colevile
and
a
famous
true
subject
took

i
am
my
lord
but
as
my
betters
are
that
led
me
hither
had
they
been
ruld
by
me
you
should
have
won
them
dearer
than
you
have
i
know
not
how
they
sold
themselves
but
thou
like
a
kind
fellow
gavest
thyself
away
gratis
and
i
thank
thee
for
thee
have
you
left
pursuit
retreat
is
made
and
execution
stayd
send
colevile
with
his
confederates
to
york
to
present
execution
blunt
lead

hence
and
see

and
now
dispatch
we
toward
the
court
my
lords
i
hear
the
king
my
father
is
sore
sick
our
news
shall
go
before
us
to
his
majesty
which
cousin
you
shall
bear
to
comfort
him
and
we
with
sober
speed
will
follow
you
my
lord
i
beseech
you
give
me
leave
to
go
through
gloucestershire
and
when
you
come
to
court
stand
my
good
lord
pray
in
your
good
report
fare
you
well
falstaff
i
in
my
condition
shall
better
speak
of
you
than
you
deserve
i
would
you
had
but
the
wit
twere
better
than
your
dukedom
good
faith
this
same
young
soberblooded
boy
doth
not
love
me
nor
a
man
cannot
make
him
laugh
but
thats
no
marvel
he
drinks
no
wine
theres
never
none
of
these
demure
boys
come
to
any
proof
for
thin
drink
doth
so
overcool
their
blood
and
making
many
fishmeals
that
they
fall
into
a
kind
of
male
greensickness
and
then
when
they
marry
they
get
wenches
they
are
generally
fools
and
cowards
which
some
of
us
should
be
too
but
for
inflammation
a
good
sherrissack
hath
a
twofold
operation
in
it
it
ascends
me
into
the
brain
dries
me
there
all
the
foolish
and
dull
and
crudy
vapours
which
environ
it
makes
it
apprehensive
quick
forgetive
full
of
nimble
fiery
and
delectable
shapes
which
deliverd
oer
to
the
voice
the
tongue
which
is
the
birth
becomes
excellent
wit
the
second
property
of
your
excellent
sherris
is
the
warming
of
the
blood
which
before
cold
and
settled
left
the
liver
white
and
pale
which
is
the
badge
of
pusillanimity
and
cowardice
but
the
sherris
warms
it
and
makes
it
course
from
the
inwards
to
the
parts
extreme
it
illumineth
the
face
which
as
a
beacon
gives
warning
to
all
the
rest
of
this
little
kingdom
man
to
arm
and
then
the
vital
commoners
and
inland
petty
spirits
muster
me
all
to
their
captain
the
heart
who
great
and
puffed
up
with
this
retinue
doth
any
deed
of
courage
and
this
valour
comes
of
sherris
so
that
skill
in
the
weapon
is
nothing
without
sack
for
that
sets
it
awork
and
leaining
a
mere
hoard
of
gold
kept
by
a
devil
till
sack
commences
it
and
sets
it
in
act
and
use
hereof
comes
it
that
prince
harry
is
valiant
for
the
cold
blood
he
did
naturally
inherit
of
his
father
he
hath
like
lean
sterile
and
bare
land
manured
husbanded
and
tilled
with
excellent
endeavour
of
drinking
good
and
good
store
of
fertile
sherris
that
he
is
become
very
hot
and
valiant
if
i
had
a
thousand
sons
the
first
human
principle
i
would
teach
them
should
be
to
forswear
thin
potations
and
to
addict
themselves
to
sack
how
now
bardolph
the
army
is
discharged
all
and
gone
let
them
go
ill
through
gloucestershire
and
there
will
i
visit
master
robert
shallow
esquire
i
have
him
already
tempering
between
my
finger
and
my
thumb
and
shortly
will
i
seal
with
him
come
away
now
lords
if
god
doth
give
successful
end
to
this
debate
that
bleedeth
at
our
doors
we
will
our
youth
lead
on
to
higher
fields
and
draw
no
swords
but
what
are
sanctified
our
navy
is
addressd
our
power
collected
our
substitutes
in
absence
well
invested
and
everything
lies
level
to
our
wish
only
we
want
a
little
personal
strength
and
pause
us
till
these
rebels
now
afoot
come
underneath
the
yoke
of
government
both
which
we
doubt
not
but
your
majesty
shall
soon
enjoy
humphrey
my
son
of
gloucester
where
is
the
prince
your
brother
i
think
hes
gone
to
hunt
my
lord
at
windsor
and
how
accompanied
i
do
not
know
my
lord
is
not
his
brother
thomas
of
clarence
with
him
no
my
good
lord
he
is
in
presence
here
what
would
my
lord
and
father
nothing
but
well
to
thee
thomas
of
clarence
how
chance
thou
art
not
with
the
prince
thy
brother
he
loves
thee
and
thou
dost
neglect
him
thomas
thou
hast
a
better
place
in
his
affection
than
all
thy
brothers
cherish
it
my
boy
and
noble
offices
thou
mayst
effect
of
mediation
after
i
am
dead
between
his
greatness
and
thy
other
brethren
therefore
omit
him
not
blunt
not
his
love
nor
lose
the
good
advantage
of
his
grace
by
seeming
cold
or
careless
of
his
will
for
he
is
gracious
if
he
be
observd
he
hath
a
tear
for
pity
and
a
hand
open
as
day
for
melting
charity
yet
notwithstanding
being
incensd
hes
flint
as
humorous
as
winter
and
as
sudden
as
flaws
congealed
in
the
spring
of
day
his
temper
therefore
must
be
well
observd
chide
him
for
faults
and
do
it
reverently
when
you
perceive
his
blood
inclind
to
mirth
but
being
moody
give
him
line
and
scope
till
that
his
passions
like
a
whale
on
ground
confound
themselves
with
working
learn
this
thomas
and
thou
shalt
prove
a
shelter
to
thy
friends
a
hoop
of
gold
to
bind
thy
brothers
in
that
the
united
vessel
of
their
blood
mingled
with
venom
of
suggestion
as
force
perforce
the
age
will
pour
it
in
shall
never
leak
though
it
do
work
as
strong
as
aconitum
or
rash
gunpowder
i
shall
observe
him
with
all
care
and
love
why
art
thou
not
at
windsor
with
him
thomas
he
is
not
there
today
he
dines
in
london
and
how
accompanied
canst
thou
tell
that
with
poins
and
other
his
continual
followers
most
subject
is
the
fattest
soil
to
weeds
and
he
the
noble
image
of
my
youth
is
overspread
with
them
therefore
my
grief
stretches
itself
beyond
the
hour
of
death
the
blood
weeps
from
my
heart
when
i
do
shape
in
forms
imaginary
the
unguided
days
and
rotten
times
that
you
shall
look
upon
when
i
am
sleeping
with
my
ancestors
for
when
his
headstrong
riot
hath
no
curb
when
rage
and
hot
blood
are
his
counsellors
when
means
and
lavish
manners
meet
together
o
with
what
wings
shall
his
affections
fly
towards
fronting
peril
and
opposd
decay
my
gracious
lord
you
look
beyond
him
quite
the
prince
but
studies
his
companions
like
a
strange
tongue
wherein
to
gain
the
language
tis
needful
that
the
most
immodest
word
be
lookd
upon
and
learnd
which
once
attaind
your
highness
knows
comes
to
no
further
use
but
to
be
known
and
hated
so
like
gross
terms
the
prince
will
in
the
perfectness
of
time
cast
off
his
followers
and
their
memory
shall
as
a
pattern
or
a
measure
live
by
which
his
grace
must
mete
the
lives
of
others
turning
past
evils
to
advantages
tis
seldom
when
the
bee
doth
leave
her
comb
in
the
dead
carrion
whos
here
westmoreland
health
to
my
sovereign
and
new
happiness
added
to
that
that
i
am
to
deliver
prince
john
your
son
doth
kiss
your
graces
hand
mowbray
the
bishop
scroop
hastings
and
all
are
brought
to
the
correction
of
your
law
there
is
not
now
a
rebels
sword
unsheathd
but
peace
puts
forth
her
olive
everywhere
the
manner
how
this
action
hath
been
borne
here
at
more
leisure
may
your
highness
read
with
every
course
in
his
particular
o
westmoreland
thou
art
a
summer
bird
which
ever
in
the
haunch
of
winter
sings
the
lifting
up
of
day
look
heres
more
news
from
enemies
heaven
keep
your
majesty
and
when
they
stand
against
you
may
they
fall
as
those
that
i
am
come
to
tell
you
of
the
earl
northumberland
and
the
lord
bardolph
with
a
great
power
of
english
and
of
scots
are
by
the
sheriff
of
yorkshire
overthrown
the
manner
and
true
order
of
the
fight
this
packet
please
it
you
contains
at
large
and
wherefore
should
these
good
news
make
me
sick
will
fortune
never
come
with
both
hands
full
but
write
her
fair
words
still
in
foulest
letters
she
either
gives
a
stomach
and
no
food
such
are
the
poor
in
health
or
else
a
feast
and
takes
away
the
stomach
such
are
the
rich
that
have
abundance
and
enjoy
it
not
i
should
rejoice
now
at
this
happy
news
and
now
my
sight
fails
and
my
brain
is
giddy
o
me
come
near
me
now
i
am
much
ill
comfort
your
majesty
o
my
royal
father
my
sovereign
lord
cheer
up
yourself
look
up
be
patient
princes
you
do
know
these
fits
are
with
his
highness
very
ordinary
stand
from
him
give
him
air
hell
straight
be
well
no
no
he
cannot
long
hold
out
these
pangs
the
incessant
care
and
labour
of
his
mind
hath
wrought
the
mure
that
should
confine
it
in
so
thin
that
life
looks
through
and
will
break
out
the
people
fear
me
for
they
do
observe
unfatherd
heirs
and
loathly
births
of
nature
the
seasons
change
their
manners
as
the
year
had
found
some
months
asleep
and
leapd
them
over
the
river
hath
thrice
flowd
no
ebb
between
and
the
old
folk
times
doting
chronicles
say
it
did
so
a
little
time
before
that
our
greatgrandsire
edward
sickd
and
died
speak
lower
princes
for
the
king
recovers
this
apoplexy
will
certain
be
his
end
i
pray
you
take
me
up
and
bear
me
hence
into
some
other
chamber
softly
pray
let
there
be
no
noise
made
my
gentle
friends
unless
some
dull
and
favourable
hand
will
whisper
music
to
my
weary
spirit
call
for
the
music
in
the
other
room
set
me
the
crown
upon
my
pillow
here
his
eye
is
hollow
and
he
changes
much
less
noise
less
noise
who
saw
the
duke
of
clarence
i
am
here
brother
full
of
heaviness
how
now
rain
within
doors
and
none
abroad
how
doth
the
king
exceeding
ill
heard
he
the
good
news
yet
tell
it
him
he
alterd
much
upon
the
hearing
it
if
he
be
sick
with
joy
he
will
recover
without
physic
not
so
much
noise
my
lords
sweet
prince
speak
low
the
king
your
father
is
disposd
to
sleep
let
us
withdraw
into
the
other
room
willt
please
your
grace
to
go
along
with
us
no
i
will
sit
and
watch
here
by
the
king
why
doth
the
crown
lie
there
upon
his
pillow
being
so
troublesome
a
bedfellow
o
polishd
perturbation
golden
care
that
keepst
the
ports
of
slumber
open
wide
to
many
a
watchful
night
sleep
with
it
now
yet
not
so
sound
and
half
so
deeply
sweet
as
he
whose
brow
with
homely
biggin
bound
snores
out
the
watch
of
night
o
majesty
when
thou
dost
pinch
thy
bearer
thou
dost
sit
like
a
rich
armour
worn
in
heat
of
day
that
scalds
with
safety
by
his
gates
of
breath
there
lies
a
downy
feather
which
stirs
not
did
he
suspire
that
light
and
weightless
down
perforce
must
move
my
gracious
lord
my
father
this
sleep
is
sound
indeed
this
is
a
sleep
that
from
this
golden
rigol
hath
divorcd
so
many
english
kings
thy
due
from
me
is
tears
and
heavy
sorrows
of
the
blood
which
nature
love
and
filial
tenderness
shall
o
dear
father
pay
thee
plenteously
my
due
from
thee
is
this
imperial
crown
which
as
immediate
from
thy
place
and
blood
derives
itself
to
me
lo
here
it
sits
which
heaven
shall
guard
and
put
the
worlds
whole
strength
into
one
giant
arm
it
shall
not
force
this
lineal
honour
from
me
this
from
thee
will
i
to
mine
leave
as
tis
left
to
me
warwick
gloucester
clarence
doth
the
king
call
what
would
your
majesty
how
fares
your
grace
why
did
you
leave
me
here
alone
my
lords
we
left
the
prince
my
brother
here
my
liege
who
undertook
to
sit
and
watch
by
you
the
prince
of
wales
where
is
he
let
me
see
him
he
is
not
here
this
door
is
open
he
is
gone
this
way
he
came
not
through
the
chamber
where
we
stayd
where
is
the
crown
who
took
it
from
my
pillow
when
we
withdrew
my
liege
we
left
it
here
the
prince
hath
taen
it
hence
go
seek
him
out
is
he
so
hasty
that
he
doth
suppose
my
sleep
my
death
find
him
my
lord
of
warwick
chide
him
hither
this
part
of
his
conjoins
with
my
disease
and
helps
to
end
me
see
sons
what
things
you
are
how
quickly
nature
falls
into
revolt
when
gold
becomes
her
object
for
this
the
foolish
overcareful
fathers
have
broke
their
sleeps
with
thoughts
their
brains
with
care
their
bones
with
industry
for
this
they
have
engrossed
and
pild
up
the
cankerd
heaps
of
strangeachieved
gold
for
this
they
have
been
thoughtful
to
invest
their
sons
with
arts
and
martial
exercises
when
like
the
bee
culling
from
every
flower
the
virtuous
sweets
our
thighs
packed
with
wax
our
mouths
with
honey
we
bring
it
to
the
hive
and
like
the
bees
are
murderd
for
our
pains
this
bitter
taste
yield
his
engrossments
to
the
ending
father
now
where
is
he
that
will
not
stay
so
long
till
his
friend
sickness
hath
determind
me
my
lord
i
found
the
prince
in
the
next
room
washing
with
kindly
tears
his
gentle
cheeks
with
such
a
deep
demeanour
in
great
sorrow
that
tyranny
which
never
quaffd
but
blood
would
by
beholding
him
have
washd
his
knife
with
gentle
eyedrops
he
is
coming
hither
but
wherefore
did
he
take
away
the
crown
lo
where
he
comes
come
hither
to
me
harry
depart
the
chamber
leave
us
here
alone
i
never
thought
to
hear
you
speak
again
thy
wish
was
father
harry
to
that
thought
i
stay
too
long
by
thee
i
weary
thee
dost
thou
so
hunger
for
my
empty
chair
that
thou
wilt
needs
invest
thee
with
mine
honours
before
thy
hour
be
ripe
o
foolish
youth
thou
seekst
the
greatness
that
will
overwhelm
thee
stay
but
a
little
for
my
cloud
of
dignity
is
held
from
falling
with
so
weak
a
wind
that
it
will
quickly
drop
my
day
is
dim
thou
hast
stoln
that
which
after
some
few
hours
were
thine
without
offence
and
at
my
death
thou
hast
seald
up
my
expectation
thy
life
did
manifest
thou
lovdst
me
not
and
thou
wilt
have
me
die
assurd
of
it
thou
hidst
a
thousand
daggers
in
thy
thoughts
which
thou
hast
whetted
on
thy
stony
heart
to
stab
at
half
an
hour
of
my
life
what
canst
thou
not
forbear
me
half
an
hour
then
get
thee
gone
and
dig
my
grave
thyself
and
bid
the
merry
bells
ring
to
thine
ear
that
thou
art
crowned
not
that
i
am
dead
let
all
the
tears
that
should
bedew
my
hearse
be
drops
of
balm
to
sanctify
thy
head
only
compound
me
with
forgotten
dust
give
that
which
gave
thee
life
unto
the
worms

o

thy
care
o
thou
wilt
be
a
wilderness
again
peopled
with
wolves
thy
old
inhabitants
o
pardon
me
my
liege
but
for
my
tears
the
moist
impediments
unto
my
speech
i
had
forestalld
this
dear
and
deep
rebuke
ere
you
with
grief
had
spoke
and
i
had
heard
the
course
of
it
so
far
there
is
your
crown
and
he
that
wears
the
crown
immortally
long
guard
it
yours
if
i
affect
it
more
than
as
your
honour
and
as
your
renown
let
me
no
more
from
this
obedience
rise
which
my
most
true
and
inward
duteous
spirit
teacheth
this
prostrate
and
exterior
bending
god
witness
with
me
when
i
here
came
in
and
found
no
course
of
breath
within
your
majesty
how
cold
it
struck
my
heart
if
i
do
feign
o
let
me
in
my
present
wildness
die
and
never
live
to
show
the
incredulous
world
the
noble
change
that
i
have
purposed
coming
to
look
on
you
thinking
you
dead
and
dead
almost
my
liege
to
think
you
were
i
spake
unto
the
crown
as
having
sense
and
thus
upbraided
it
the
care
on
thee
depending
hath
fed
upon
the
body
of
my
father
therefore
thou
best
of
gold
art
worst
of
gold
other
less
fine
in
carat
is
more
precious
preserving
life
in
medicine
potable
but
thou
most
fine
most
honourd
most
renownd
hast
eat
thy
bearer
up
thus
my
most
royal
liege
accusing
it
i
put
it
on
my
head
to
try
with
it
as
with
an
enemy
that
had
before
my
face
murderd
my
father
the
quarrel
of
a
true
inheritor
but
if
it
did
infect
my
blood
with
joy
or
swell
my
thoughts
to
any
strain
of
pride
if
any
rebel
or
vain
spirit
of
mine
did
with
the
least
affection
of
a
welcome
give
entertainment
to
the
might
of
it
let
god
for
ever
keep
it
from
my
head
and
make
me
as
the
poorest
vassal
is
that
doth
with
awe
and
terror
kneel
to
it
o
my
son
god
put
it
in
thy
mind
to
take
it
hence
that
thou
mightst
win
the
more
thy
fathers
love
pleading
so
wisely
in
excuse
of
it
come
hither
harry
sit
thou
by
my
bed
and
hear
i
think
the
very
latest
counsel
that
ever
i
shall
breathe
god
knows
my
son
by
what
bypaths
and
indirect
crookd
ways
i
met
this
crown
and
i
myself
know
well
how
troublesome
it
sat
upon
my
head
to
thee
it
shall
descend
with
better
quiet
better
opinion
better
confirmation
for
all
the
soil
of
the
achievement
goes
with
me
into
the
earth
it
seemd
in
me
but
as
an
honour
snatchd
with
boisterous
hand
and
i
had
many
living
to
upbraid
my
gain
of
it
by
their
assistances
which
daily
grew
to
quarrel
and
to
bloodshed
wounding
supposed
peace
all
these
bold
fears
thou
seest
with
peril
i
have
answered
for
all
my
reign
hath
been
but
as
a
scene
acting
that
argument
and
now
my
death
changes
the
mode
for
what
in
me
was
purchasd
falls
upon
thee
in
a
more
fairer
sort
so
thou
the
garment
wearst
successively
yet
though
thou
standst
more
sure
than
i
could
do
thou
art
not
firm
enough
since
griefs
are
green
and
all
my
friends
which
thou
must
make
thy
friends
have
but
their
stings
and
teeth
newly
taen
out
by
whose
fell
working
i
was
first
advancd
and
by
whose
power
i
well
might
lodge
a
fear
to
be
again
displacd
which
to
avoid
i
cut
them
off
and
had
a
purpose
now
to
lead
out
many
to
the
holy
land
lest
rest
and
lying
still
might
make
them
look
too
near
unto
my
state
therefore
my
harry
be
it
thy
course
to
busy
giddy
minds
with
foreign
quarrels
that
action
hence
borne
out
may
waste
the
memory
of
the
former
days
more
would
i
but
my
lungs
are
wasted
so
that
strength
of
speech
is
utterly
denied
me
how
i
came
by
the
crown
o
god
forgive
and
grant
it
may
with
thee
in
true
peace
live
my
gracious
liege
you
won
it
wore
it
kept
it
gave
it
me
then
plain
and
right
must
my
possession
be
which
i
with
more
than
with
a
common
pain
gainst
all
the
world
will
rightfully
maintain
look
look

sir
for
they
have
marvellous
foul
linen
well
conceited
davy
about
thy
business
davy
i
beseech
you
sir
to
countenance
william
visor
of
wincot
against
clement
perkes
of
the
hill
there
are
many
complaints
davy
against
that
visor
that
visor
is
an
arrant
knave
on
my
knowledge
i
grant
your
worship
that
he
is
a
knave
sir
but
yet
god
forbid
sir
but
a
knave
should
have
some
countenance
at
his
friends
request
an
honest
man
sir
is
able
to
speak
for
himself
when
a
knave
is
not
i
have
served
your
worship
truly
sir
this
eight
years
and
if
i
cannot
once
or
twice
in
a
quarter
bear
out
a
knave
against
an
honest
man
i
have
but
a
very
little
credit
with
your
worship
the
knave
is
mine
honest
friend
sir
therefore
i
beseech
your
worship
let
him
be
countenanced
go
to
i
say
he
shall
have
no
wrong
look
about
davy
where
are
you
sir
john
come
come
come
off
with
your
boots
give
me
your
hand
master
bardolph
i
am
glad
to
see
your
worship
i
thank
thee
with
all
my
heart
kind
master
bardolph
and
welcome
my
tall
fellow
come
sir
john
ill
follow
you
good
master
robert
shallow
if
i
were
sawed
into
quantities
i
should
make
four
dozen
of
such
bearded
hermits
staves
as
master
shallow
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
see
the
semblable
coherence
of
his
mens
spirits
and
his
they
by
observing
him
do
bear
themselves
like
foolish
justices
he
by
conversing
with
them
is
turned
into
a
justicelike
servingman
their
spirits
are
so
married
in
conjunction
with
the
participation
of
society
that
they
flock
together
in
consent
like
so
many
wildgeese
if
i
had
a
suit
to
master
shallow
i
would
humour
his
men
with
the
imputation
of
being
near
their
master
if
to
his
men
i
would
curry
with
master
shallow
that
no
man
could
better
command
his
servants
it
is
certain
that
either
wise
bearing
or
ignorant
carriage
is
caught
as
men
take
diseases
one
of
another
therefore
let
men
take
heed
of
their
company
i
will
devise
matter
enough
out
of
this
shallow
to
keep
prince
harry
in
continual
laughter
the
wearing
out
of
six
fashions
which
is
four
terms
or
two
actions
and
a
shall
laugh
without
intervallums
o
it
is
much
that
a
lie
with
a
slight
oath
and
a
jest
with
a
sad
brow
will
do
with
a
fellow
that
never
had
the
ache
in
his
shoulders
o
you
shall
see
him
laugh
till
his
face
be
like
a
wet
cloak
ill
laid
up
sir
john
i
come
master
shallow
i
come
master
shallow
how
now
my
lord
chief
justice
whither
away
how
doth
the
king
exceeding
well
his
cares
are
now
all
ended
i
hope
not
dead
hes
walkd
the
way
of
nature
and
to
our
purposes
he
lives
no
more
i
would
his
majesty
had
calld
me
with
him
the
service
that
i
truly
did
his
life
hath
left
me
open
to
all
injuries
indeed
i
think
the
young
king
loves
you
not
i
know
he
doth
not
and
do
arm
myself
to
welcome
the
condition
of
the
time
which
cannot
look
more
hideously
upon
me
than
i
have
drawn
it
in
my
fantasy
here
come
the
heavy
issue
of
dead
harry
o
that
the
living
harry
had
the
temper
of
him
the
worst
of
these
three
gentlemen
how
many
nobles
then
should
hold
their
places
that
must
strike
sail
to
spirits
of
vile
sort
o
god
i
fear
all
will
be
overturnd
good
morrow
cousin
warwick
good
morrow
good
morrow
cousin
good
morrow
cousin
we
meet
like
men
that
had
forgot
to
speak
we
do
remember
but
our
argument
is
all
too
heavy
to
admit
much
talk
well
peace
be
with
him
that
hath
made
us
heavy
peace
be
with
us
lest
we
be
heavier
o
good
my
lord
you
have
lost
a
friend
indeed
and
i
dare
swear
you
borrow
not
that
face
of
seeming
sorrow
it
is
sure
your
own
though
no
man
be
assurd
what
grace
to
find
you
stand
in
coldest
expectation
i
am
the
sorrier
would
twere
otherwise
well
you
must
now
speak
sir
john
falstaff
fair
which
swims
against
your
stream
of
quality
sweet
princes
what
i
did
i
did
in
honour
led
by
the
impartial
conduct
of
my
soul
and
never
shall
you
see
that
i
will
beg
a
ragged
and
forestalld
remission
if
truth
and
upright
innocency
fail
me
ill
to
the
king
my
master
that
is
dead
and
tell
him
who
hath
sent
me
after
him
here
comes
the
prince
good
morrow
and
god
save
your
majesty
this
new
and
gorgeous
garment
majesty
sits
not
so
easy
on
me
as
you
think
brothers
you
mix
your
sadness
with
some
fear
this
is
the
english
not
the
turkish
court
not
amurath
an
amurath
succeeds
but
harry
harry
yet
be
sad
good
brothers
for
to
speak
truth
it
very
well
becomes
you
sorrow
so
royally
in
you
appears
that
i
will
deeply
put
the
fashion
on
and
wear
it
in
my
heart
why
then
be
sad
but
entertain
no
more
of
it
good
brothers
than
a
joint
burden
laid
upon
us
all
for
me
by
heaven
i
bid
you
be
assurd
ill
be
your
father
and
your
brother
too
let
me
but
bear
your
love
ill
bear
your
cares
yet
weep
that
harrys
dead
and
so
will
i
but
harry
lives
that
shall
convert
those
tears
by
number
into
hours
of
happiness
we
hope
no
other
from
your
majesty
you
all
look
strangely
on
me
and
you
most
you
are
i
think
assurd
i
love
you
not
i
am
assurd
if
i
be
measurd
rightly
your
majesty
hath
no
just
cause
to
hate
me
no
how
might
a
prince
of
my
great
hopes
forget
so
great
indignities
you
laid
upon
me
what
rate
rebuke
and
roughly
send
to
prison
the
immediate
heir
of
england
was
this
easy
may
this
be
washd
in
lethe
and
forgotten
i
then
did
use
the
person
of
your
father
the
image
of
his
power
lay
then
in
me
and
in
the
administration
of
his
law
whiles
i
was
busy
for
the
commonwealth
your
highness
pleased
to
forget
my
place
the
majesty
and
power
of
law
and
justice
the
image
of
the
king
whom
i
presented
and
struck
me
in
my
very
seat
of
judgment
whereon
as
an
offender
to
your
father
i
gave
bold
way
to
my
authority
and
did
commit
you
if
the
deed
were
ill
be
you
contented
wearing
now
the
garland
to
have
a
son
set
your
decrees
at
nought
to
pluck
down
justice
from
your
awful
bench
to
trip
the
course
of
law
and
blunt
the
sword
that
guards
the
peace
and
safety
of
your
person
nay
more
to
spurn
at
your
most
royal
image
and
mock
your
workings
in
a
second
body
question
your
royal
thoughts
make
the
case
yours
be
now
the
father
and
propose
a
son
hear
your
own
dignity
so
much
profand
see
your
most
dreadful
laws
so
loosely
slighted
behold
yourself
so
by
a
son
disdaind
and
then
imagine
me
taking
your
part
and
in
your
power
soft
silencing
your
son
after
this
cold
considerance
sentence
me
and
as
you
are
a
king
speak
in
your
state
what
i
have
done
that
misbecame
my
place
my
person
or
my
lieges
sovreignty
you
are
right
justice
and
you
weigh
this
well
therefore
still
bear
the
balance
and
the
sword
and
i
do
wish
your
honours
may
increase
till
you
do
live
to
see
a
son
of
mine
offend
you
and
obey
you
as
i
did
so
shall
i
live
to
speak
my
fathers
words
happy
am
i
that
have
a
man
so
bold
that
dares
do
justice
on
my
proper
son
and
not
less
happy
having
such
a
son
that
would
deliver
up
his
greatness
so
into
the
hands
of
justice
you
did
commit
me
for
which
i
do
commit
into
your
hand
the
unstained
sword
that
you
have
usd
to
bear
with
this
remembrance
that
you
use
the
same
with
the
like
bold
just
and
impartial
spirit
as
you
have
done
gainst
me
there
is
my
hand
you
shall
be
as
a
father
to
my
youth
my
voice
shall
sound
as
you
do
prompt
mine
ear
and
i
will
stoop
and
humble
my
intents
to
your
wellpractisd
wise
directions
and
princes
all
believe
me
i
beseech
you
my
father
is
gone
wild
into
his
grave
for
in
his
tomb
lie
my
affections
and
with
his
spirit
sadly
i
survive
to
mock
the
expectation
of
the
world
to
frustrate
prophecies
and
to
raze
out
rotten
opinion
who
hath
writ
me
down
after
my
seeming
the
tide
of
blood
in
me
hath
proudly
flowd
in
vanity
till
now
now
doth
it
turn
and
ebb
back
to
the
sea
where
it
shall
mingle
with
the
state
of
floods
and
flow
henceforth
in
formal
majesty
now
call

our
high
court
of
parliament

but
to
the
purpose
and

to
the
venture
be
it
known
to
you
as

very
well

was
lately
here

end
of

play

pray
your
patience
for
it
and
to
promise
you
a
better
i
did
mean
indeed
to
pay
you
with
this
which
if
like
an
ill
venture

come
unluckily
home
i
break
and
you
my
gentle
creditors
lose

would
be

here
i
commit
my
body
to
your
mercies

me
some
and
i
will
pay
you
some
and
as
most
debtors
do
promise
you
infinitely
if
my
tongue
cannot
entreat
you
to
acquit
me
will
you
command
me
to
use
my
legs
and
yet
that
were
but
light
payment
to
dance
out
of
your
debt
but
a
good
conscience
will
make
any
possible
satisfaction
and
so
will
i
all
the
gentlewomen
here
have
forgiven
me
if
the
gentlemen
will
not
then
the
gentlemen
do
not
agree
with
the
gentlewomen
which
was
never
seen
before
in
such
an
assembly
one
word
more
i
beseech
you
if
you
be
not
too
much
cloyed
with
fat
meat

humble
author

the
story
with
sir
john
in
it
and
make
you
merry
with
fair
katharine
of
france
where
for
anything
i
know
falstaff
shall
die
of
a
sweat
unless
already
a
be
killed
with
your
hard
opinions
for
oldcastle

a
martyr
and
this
is
not
the
man
my
tongue
is
weary
when
my
legs
are
too

your

grief
of
all
the

what
did
my

henry
spend
his
youth
his
valour
coin
and
people
in
the
wars
did
he
so
often
lodge
in
open
field
in
winters
cold
and
summers
parching
heat
to
conquer
france
his
true
inheritance
and
did
my
brother
bedford
toil
his
wits
to
keep
by
policy
what
henry
got
have
you
yourselves
somerset
buckingham
brave
york
salisbury
and
victorious
warwick
receivd
deep
scars
in

and
normandy
or
hath
mine
uncle
beaufort
and
myself
with
all
the
learned
council
of
the
realm
studied
so
long
sat
in
the
councilhouse
early
and
late
debating
to
and
fro
how
france
and
frenchmen
might
be
kept
in
awe
and
hath
his
highness
in
his
infancy
been
crownd
in
paris
in
despite
of
foes
and
shall
these
labours
and
these
honours
die
shall
henrys
conquest
bedfords
vigilance
your
deeds
of
war
and
all
our
counsel
die
o
peers
of

shameful
is
this
league
fatal
this
marriage
cancelling
your
fame
blotting
your
names
from
books
of
memory
razing
the
characters
of
your
renown
defacing
monuments
of
conquerd
france
undoing
all
as
all
had
never
been
nephew
what
means
this
passionate
discourse
this
peroration
with
such
circumstance
for
france
tis
ours
and
we
will
keep
it
still
ay
uncle
we
will
keep
it
if
we
can
but
now
it
is
impossible
we
should
suffolk
the
newmade
duke
that
rules
the
roast
hath
given
the
duchies
of
anjou
and
maine
unto
the
poor
king
reignier
whose
large
style
agrees
not
with
the
leanness
of
his
purse
now
by
the
death
of
him
who
died
for
all
these
counties
were
the
keys
of
normandy
but
wherefore
weeps
warwick
my
valiant
son
for
grief
that
they
are
past
recovery
for
were
there
hope
to
conquer
them
again
my
sword
should
shed
hot
blood
mine
eyes
no
tears
anjou
and
maine
myself
did
win
them
both
those
provinces
these
arms
of
mine
did
conquer
and
are
the
cities
that
i
got
with
wounds
deliverd
up
again
with
peaceful
words
mort
dieu
for
suffolks
duke
may
he
be
suffocate
that
dims
the
honour
of
this
warlike
isle
france
should
have
torn
and
rent
my
very
heart
before
i
would
have
yielded
to
this
league
i
never
read
but
englands
kings
have
had
large
sums
of
gold
and
dowries
with
their
wives
and
our
king
henry
gives
away
his
own
to
match
with
her
that
brings
no
vantages
a
proper
jest
and
never
heard
before
that
suffolk
should
demand
a
whole
fifteenth
for
costs
and
charges
in
transporting
her
she
should
have
stayd
in
france
and
starvd
in
france
before
my
lord
of
gloucester
now
you
grow
too
hot
it
was
the
pleasure
of
my
lord
the
king
my
lord
of
winchester
i
know
your
mind
tis
not
my
speeches
that
you
do
mislike
but
tis
my
presence
that
doth
trouble
ye
rancour
will
out
proud
prelate
in
thy
face
i
see
thy
fury
if
i
longer
stay
we
shall
begin
our
ancient
bickerings
lordings
farewell
and
say
when
i
am
gone
i
prophesied
france
will
be
lost
ere
long
so
there
goes
our
protector
in
a
rage
tis
known
to
you
he
is
mine
enemy
nay
more
an
enemy
unto
you
all
and
no
great
friend
i
fear
me
to
the
king
consider
lords
he
is
the
next
of
blood
and
heir
apparent
to
the
english
crown
had
henry
got
an
empire
by
his
marriage
and
all
the
wealthy
kingdoms
of
the
west
theres
reason
he
should
be
displeasd
at
it
look
to
it
lords
let
not
his
smoothing
words
bewitch
your
hearts
be
wise
and
circumspect
what
though
the
common
people
favour
him
calling
him
humphrey
the
good
duke
of
gloucester
clapping
their
hands
and
crying
with
loud
voice
jesu
maintain
your
royal
excellence
with
god
preserve
the
good
duke
humphrey
i
fear
me
lords
for
all
this
flattering
gloss
he
will
be
found
a
dangerous
protector
why
should
he
then
protect
our
sovereign
he
being
of
age
to
govern
of
himself
cousin
of
somerset
join
you
with
me
and
all
together
with
the
duke
of
suffolk
well
quickly
hoise
duke
humphrey
from
his
seat
this
weighty
business
will
not
brook
delay
ill
to
the
duke
of
suffolk
presently
cousin
of
buckingham
though
humphreys
pride
and
greatness
of
his
place
be
grief
to
us
yet
let
us
watch
the
haughty
cardinal
his
insolence
is
more
intolerable
than
all
the
princes
in
the
land
beside
if
gloucester
be
displacd
hell
be
protector
or
thou
or
i
somerset
will
be
protector
despite
duke
humphrey
or
the
cardinal
pride
went
before
ambition
follows
him
while
these
do
labour
for
their
own
preferment
behoves
it
us
to
labour
for
the
realm
i
never
saw
but
humphrey
duke
of
gloucester
did
bear
him
like
a
noble
gentleman
oft
have
i
seen
the
haughty
cardinal
more
like
a
soldier
than
a
man
o
the
church
as
stout
and
proud
as
he
were
lord
of
all
swear
like
a
ruffian
and
demean
himself
unlike
the
ruler
of
a
commonweal
warwick
my
son
the
comfort
of
my
age
thy
deeds
thy
plainness
and
thy
housekeeping
have
won
the
greatest
favour
of
the
commons
excepting
none
but
good
duke
humphrey
and
brother
york
thy
acts
in
ireland
in
bringing
them
to
civil
discipline
thy
late
exploits
done
in
the
heart
of
france
when
thou
wert
regent
for
our
sovereign
have
made
thee
feard
and
honourd
of
the
people
join
we
together
for
the
public
good
in
what
we
can
to
bridle
and
suppress
the
pride
of
suffolk
and
the
cardinal
with
somersets
and
buckinghams
ambition
and
as
we
may
cherish
duke
humphreys
deeds
while
they
do
tend
the
profit
of
the
land
so
god
help
warwick
as
he
loves
the
land
and
common
profit
of
his
country
and
so
says
york
for
he
hath
greatest
cause
then
lets
make
haste
away
and
look
unto
the
main
unto
the
main
o
father
maine
is
lost
that
maine
which
by
main
force
warwick
did
win
and
would
have
kept
so
long
as
breath
did
last
main
chance
father
you
meant
but
i
meant
maine
which
i
will
win
from
france
or
else
be
slain
anjou
and
maine
are
given
to
the
french
paris
is
lost
the
state
of
normandy
stands
on
a
tickle
point
now
they
are
gone
suffolk
concluded
on
the
articles
the
peers
agreed
and
henry
was
well
pleasd
to
change
two
dukedoms
for
a
dukes
fair
daughter
i
cannot
blame
them
all
what
ist
to
them
tis
thine
they
give
away
and
not
their
own
pirates
may
make
cheap
pennyworths
of
their
pillage
and
purchase
friends
and
give
to
courtezans
still
revelling
like
lords
till
all
be
gone
while
as
the
silly
owner
of
the
goods
weeps
over
them
and
wrings
his
hapless
hands
and
shakes
his
head
and
trembling
stands
aloof
while
all
is
shard
and
all
is
borne
away
ready
to
starve
and
dare
not
touch
his
own
so
york
must
sit
and
fret
and
bite
his
tongue
while
his
own
lands
are
bargaind
for
and
sold
methinks
the
realms
of
england
france
and
ireland
bear
that
proportion
to
my
flesh
and
blood
as
did
the
fatal
brand
alth
a
burnd
unto
the
princes
heart
of
calydon
anjou
and
maine
both
given
unto
the
french
cold
news
for
me
for
i
had
hope
of
france
even
as
i
have
of
fertile
englands
soil
a
day
will
come
when
york
shall
claim
his
own
and
therefore
i
will
take
the
nevils
parts
and
make
a
show
of
love
to
proud
duke
humphrey
and
when
i
spy
advantage
claim
the
crown
for
thats
the
golden
mark
i
seek
to
hit
nor
shall
proud
lancaster
usurp
my
right
nor
hold
the
sceptre
in
his
childish
fist
nor
wear
the
diadem
upon
his
head
whose
churchlike
humours
fit
not
for
a
crown
then
york
be
still
awhile
till
time
do
serve
watch
thou
and
wake
when
others
be
asleep
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
the
state
till
henry
surfeiting
in
joys
of
love
with
his
new
bride
and
englands
dearbought
queen
and
humphrey
with
the
peers
be
falln
at
jars
then
will
i
raise
aloft
the
milkwhite
rose
with
whose
sweet
smell
the
air
shall
be
perfumd
and
in
my
standard
bear
the
arms
of
york
to
grapple
with
the
house
of
lancaster
and
force
perforce
ill
make
him
yield
the
crown
whose
bookish
rule
hath
pulld
fair
england
down
why
droops
my
lord
like
overripend
corn
hanging
the
head
at
ceres
plenteous
load
why
doth
the
great
duke
humphrey
knit
his
brows
as
frowning
at
the
favours
of
the
world
why
are
thine
eyes
fixd
to
the
sullen
earth
gazing
on
that
which
seems
to
dim
thy
sight
what
seest
thou
there
king
henrys
diadem
enchasd
with
all
the
honours
of
the
world
if
so
gaze
on
and
grovel
on
thy
face
until
thy
head
be
circled
with
the
same
put
forth
thy
hand
reach
at
the
glorious
gold
what
ist
too
short
ill
lengthen
it
with
mine
and
having
both
together
heavd
it
up
well
both
together
lift
our
heads
to
heaven
and
never
more
abase
our
sight
so
low
as
to
vouchsafe
one
glance
unto
the
ground
o
nell
sweet
nell
if
thou
dost
love
thy
lord
banish
the
canker
of
ambitious
thoughts
and
may
that
thought
when
i
imagine
ill
against
my
king
and
nephew
virtuous
henry
be
my
last
breathing
in
this
mortal
world
my
troublous
dream
this
night
doth
make
me
sad
what
dreamd
my
lord
tell
me
and
ill
requite
it
with
sweet
rehearsal
of
my
mornings
dream
methought
this
staff
mine
officebadge
in
court
was
broke
in
twain
by
whom
i
have
forgot
but
as
i
think
it
was
by
the
cardinal
and
on
the
pieces
of
the
broken
wand
were
placd
the
heads
of
edmund
duke
of
somerset
and
william
de
la
pole
first
duke
of
suffolk
this
was
my
dream
what
it
doth
bode
god
knows
tut
this
was
nothing
but
an
argument
that
he
that
breaks
a
stick
of
gloucesters
grove
shall
lose
his
head
for
his
presumption
but
list
to
me
my
humphrey
my
sweet
duke
methought
i
sat
in
seat
of
majesty
in
the
cathedral
church
of
westminster
and
in
that
chair
where
kings
and
queens
are
crownd
where

away
base
cullions
suffolk
let
them
go
come
lets
be
gone
my
lord
of
suffolk
say
is
this
the
guise
is
this
the
fashion
of
the
court
of
england
is
this
the
government
of
britains
isle
and
this
the
royalty
of
albions
king
what
shall
king
henry
be
a
pupil
still
under
the
surly
gloucesters
governance
am
i
a
queen
in
title
and
in
style
and
must
be
made
a
subject
to
a
duke
i
tell
thee
pole
when
in
the
city
tours
thou
ranst
a
tilt
in
honour
of
my
love
and
stolst
away
the
ladies
hearts
of
france
i
thought
king
henry
had
resembled
thee
in
courage
courtship
and
proportion
but
all
his
mind
is
bent
to
holiness
to
number
avemaries
on
his
beads
his
champions
are
the
prophets
and
apostles
his
weapons
holy
saws
of
sacred
writ
his
study
is
his
tiltyard
and
his
loves
are
brazen
images
of
canonizd
saints
i
would
the
college
of
the
cardinals
would
choose
him
pope
and
carry
him
to
rome
and
set
the
triple
crown
upon
his
head
that
were
a
state
fit
for
his
holiness
madam
be
patient
as
i
was
cause
your
highness
came
to
england
so
will
i
in
england
work
your
graces
full
content
beside
the
haught
protector
have
we
beaufort
the
imperious
churchman
somerset
buckingham
and
grumbling
york
and
not
the
least
of
these
but
can
do
more
in
england
than
the
king
and
he
of
these
that
can
do
most
of
all
cannot
do
more
in
england
than
the
nevils
salisbury
and
warwick
are
no
simple
peers
not
all
these
lords
do
vex
me
half
so
much
as
that
proud
dame
the
lord
protectors
wife
she
sweeps
it
through
the
court
with
troops
of
ladies
more
like
an
empress
than
duke
humphreys
wife
strangers
in
court
do
take
her
for
the
queen
she
bears
a
dukes
revenues
on
her
back
and
in
her
heart
she
scorns
our
poverty
shall
i
not
live
to
be
avengd
on
her
contemptuous
baseborn
callot
as
she
is
she
vaunted
mongst
her
minions
tother
day
the
very
train
of
her
worst
wearing
gown
was
better
worth
than
all
my
fathers
lands
till
suffolk
gave
two
dukedoms
for
his
daughter
madam
myself
have
limd
a
bush
for
her
and
placd
a
quire
of
such
enticing
birds
that
she
will
light
to
listen
to
the
lays
and
never
mount
to
trouble
you
again
so
let
her
rest
and
madam
list
to
me
for
i
am
bold
to
counsel
you
in
this
although
we
fancy
not
the
cardinal
yet
must
we
join
with
him
and
with
the
lords
till
we
have
brought
duke
humphrey
in
disgrace
as
for
the
duke
of
york
this
late
complaint
will
make
but
little
for
his
benefit
so
one
by
one
well
weed
them
all
at
last
and
you
yourself
shall
steer
the
happy
helm
for
my
part
noble
lords
i
care
not
which
or
somerset
or
york
alls
one
to
me
if
york
have
ill
demeand
himself
in
france
then
let
him
be
denayd
the
regentship
if
somerset
be
unworthy
of
the
place
let
york
be
regent
i
will
yield
to
him
whether
your
grace
be
worthy
yea
or
no
dispute
not
that
york
is
the
worthier
ambitious
warwick
let
thy
betters
speak
the
cardinals
not
my
better
in
the
field
all
in
this
presence
are
thy
betters
warwick
warwick
may
live
to
be
the
best
of
all
peace
son
and
show
some
reason
buckingham
why
somerset
should
be
preferrd
in
this
because
the
king
forsooth
will
have
it
so
madam
the
king
is
old
enough
himself
to
give
his
censure
these
are
no
womens
matters
if
he
be
old
enough
what
needs
your
grace
to
be
protector
of
his
excellence
madam
i
am
protector
of
the
realm
and
at
his
pleasure
will
resign
my
place

it
then

insolence
since

been
as
bondmen
to
thy
sovereignty

commons
hast
thou
rackd
the
clergys
bags
are
lank
and
lean
with
thy
extortions
thy
sumptuous
buildings
and
thy
wifes
attire
have
cost
a
mass
of
public
treasury
thy
cruelty
in
execution
upon
offenders
hath
exceeded
law
and
left
thee
to
the
mercy
of
the
law
thy
sale
of
offices
and
towns
in
france
if
they
were
known
as
the
suspect
is
great

make
thee
quickly
hop

confederacy
of

the
protectors

the
ringleader
and
head
of
all
this
rout
have
practisd
dangerously
against
your
state
dealing
with
witches
and
with
conjurers
whom
we
have
apprehended
in
the
fact
raising
up
wicked
spirits
from
underground
demanding
of
king
henrys
life
and
death
and
other
of
your
highness
privy
council
as
more

to
thee

how
it
stands
sorry

forgot
honour
and
virtue
and
conversd
with
such
as
like
to
pitch
defile
nobility
i
banish
her
my
bed
and
company
and
give
her
as
a
prey
to
law
and
shame
that
hath
dishonourd
gloucesters
honest
name
well
for
this
night
we
will
repose
us
here
tomorrow
toward
london
back
again
to
look
into
this
business
thoroughly
and
call
these
foul
offenders
to
their
answers
and
poise
the
cause
in
justice
equal
scales
whose
beam
stands
sure
whose
rightful
cause
prevails

of
my
title
which
is
infallible
to
englands
crown
my
lord
i
long
to
hear
it
at
full
sweet
york
begin
and
if
thy
claim
be
good
the
nevils
are
thy
subjects
to
command
then
thus
edward
the
third
my
lords
had
seven
sons
the
first
edward
the
black
prince
prince
of
wales
the
second
william
of
hatfield
and
the
third
lionel
duke
of
clarence
next
to
whom
was
john
of
gaunt
the
duke
of
lancaster
the
fifth
was
edmund
langley
duke
of
york
the
sixth
was
thomas
of
woodstock
duke
of
gloucester
william
of
windsor
was
the
seventh
and
last
edward
the
black
prince
died
before
his
father
and
left
behind
him
richard
his
only
son
who
after
edward
the
thirds
death
reignd
as
king
till
henry
bolingbroke
duke
of
lancaster
the
eldest
son
and
heir
of
john
of
gaunt
crownd
by
the
name
of
henry
the
fourth
seizd
on
the
realm
deposd
the
rightful
king
sent
his
poor
queen
to
france
from
whence
she
came
and
him
to
pomfret
where
as
all
you
know
harmless
richard
was
murderd
traitorously
father
the
duke
hath
told
the
truth
thus
got
the
house
of
lancaster
the
crown
which
now
they
hold
by
force
and
not
by
right
for
richard
the
first
sons
heir
being
dead
the
issue
of
the
next
son
should
have
reignd
but
william
of
hatfield
died
without
an
heir
the
third
son
duke
of
clarence
from
whose
line
i
claim
the
crown
had
issue
philippe
a
daughter
who
married
edmund
mortimer
earl
of
march
edmund
had
issue
roger
earl
of
march
roger
had
issue
edmund
anne
and
eleanor
this
edmund
in
the
reign
of
bolingbroke
as
i
have
read
laid
claim
unto
the
crown
and
but
for
owen
glendower
had
been
king
who
kept
him
in
captivity
till
he
died
but
to
the
rest
his
eldest
sister
anne
my
mother
being
heir
unto
the
crown
married
richard
earl
of
cambridge
who
was
son
to
edmund
langley
edward
the
thirds
fifth
son
by
her
i
claim
the
kingdom
she
was
heir
to
roger
earl
of
march
who
was
the
son
of
edmund
mortimer
who
married
philippe
sole
daughter
unto
lionel
duke
of
clarence
so
if
the
issue
of
the
eldest
son
succeed
before
the
younger
i
am
king
what
plain
proceeding
is
more
plain
than
this
henry
doth
claim
the
crown
from
john
of
gaunt
the
fourth
son
york
claims
it
from
the
third
till
lionels
issue
fails
his
should
not
reign
it
fails
not
yet
but
flourishes
in
thee
and
in
thy
sons
fair
slips
of
such
a
stock
then
father
salisbury
kneel
we
together
and
in
this
private
plot
be
we
the
first
that
shall
salute

rightful
sovereign

how

i
long
to

my
prison
i
muse
my
lord
of
gloucester
is
not
come
tis
not
his
wont
to
be
the
hindmost
man
whateer
occasion
keeps
him
from
us
now
can
you
not
see
or
will
ye
not
observe
the
strangeness
of
his
alterd
countenance
with
what
a
majesty
he
bears
himself
how
insolent
of
late
he
is
become
how
proud
how
peremptory
and
unlike
himself
we
know
the
time
since
he
was
mild
and
affable
an
if
we
did
but
glance
a
faroff
look
immediately
he
was
upon
his
knee
that
all
the
court
admird
him
for
submission
but
meet
him
now
and
be
it
in
the
morn
when
everyone
will
give
the
time
of
day
he
knits
his
brow
and
shows
an
angry
eye
and
passeth
by
with
stiff
unbowed
knee
disdaining
duty
that
to
us
belongs
small
curs
are
not
regarded
when
they
grin
but
great
men
tremble
when
the
lion
roars
and
humphrey
is
no
little
man
in
england
first
note
that
he
is
near
you
in
descent
and
should
you
fall
he
is
the
next
will
mount
me
seemeth
then
it
is
no
policy
respecting
what
a
rancorous
mind
he
bears
and
his
advantage
following
your
decease
that
he
should
come
about
your
royal
person
or
be
admitted
to
your
highness
council
by
flattery
hath
he
won
the
commons
hearts
and
when
he
please
to
make
commotion
tis
to
be
feard
they
all
will
follow
him
now
tis
the
spring
and
weeds
are
shallowrooted
suffer
them
now
and
theyll
oergrow
the
garden
and
choke
the
herbs
for
want
of
husbandry
the
reverent
care
i
bear
unto
my
lord
made
me
collect
these
dangers
in
the
duke
if
it
be
fond
call
it
a
womans
fear
which
fear
if
better
reasons
can
supplant
i
will
subscribe
and
say
i
wrongd
the
duke
my
lord
of
suffolk
buckingham
and
york
reprove
my
allegation
if
you
can
or
else
conclude
my
words
effectual
well
hath
your
highness
seen
into
this
duke
and
had
i
first
been
put
to
speak
my
mind
i
think
i
should
have
told
your
graces
tale
the
duchess
by
his
subornation
upon
my
life
began
her
devilish
practices
or
if
he
were
not
privy
to
those
faults
yet
by
reputing
of
his
high
descent
as
next
the
king
he
was
successive
heir
and
such
high
vaunts
of
his
nobility
did
instigate
the
bedlam
brainsick
duchess
by
wicked
means
to
frame
our
sovereigns
fall
smooth
runs
the
water
where
the
brook
is
deep
and
in
his
simple
show
he
harbours
treason
the
fox
barks
not
when
he
would
steal
the
lamb
no
no
my
sovreign
gloucester
is
a
man
unsounded
yet
and
full
of
deep
deceit
did
he
not
contrary
to
form
of
law
devise
strange
deaths
for
small
offences
done
and
did
he
not
in
his
protectorship
levy
great
sums
of
money
through
the
realm
for
soldiers
pay
in
france
and
never
sent
it
by
means
whereof
the
towns
each
day
revolted
tut
these
are
petty
faults
to
faults
unknown
which
time
will
bring
to
light
in
smooth
duke
humphrey
my
lords
at
once
the
care
you
have
of
us
to
mow
down
thorns
that
would
annoy
our
foot
is
worthy
praise
but
shall
i
speak
my
conscience
our
kinsman
gloucester
is
as
innocent
from
meaning
treason
to
our
royal
person
as
is
the
sucking
lamb
or
harmless
dove
the
duke
is
virtuous
mild
and
too
well
given
to
dream
on
evil
or
to
work
my
downfall
ah
whats
more
dangerous
than
this
fond
affiance
seems
he
a
dove
his
feathers
are
but
borrowd
for
hes
disposed
as
the
hateful
raven
is
he
a
lamb
his
skin
is
surely
lent
him
for
hes
inclind
as
is
the
ravenous
wolf
who
cannot
steal
a
shape
that
means
deceit
take
heed
my
lord
the
welfare
of
us
all
hangs
on
the
cutting
short
that
fraudful
man
all
health
unto
my
gracious
sovereign
welcome
lord
somerset
what
news
from
france
that
all
your
interest
in
those
territories
is
utterly
bereft
you
all
is
lost
cold
news
lord
somerset
but
gods
will
be
done
cold
news
for
me
for
i
had
hope
of
france
as
firmly
as
i
hope
for
fertile
england
thus
are
my
blossoms
blasted
in
the
bud
and
caterpillars
eat
my
leaves
away
but
i
will
remedy
this
gear
ere
long
or
sell
my
title
for
a
glorious
grave
all
happiness
unto
my
lord
the
king
pardon
my
liege
that
i
have
stayd
so
long
nay
gloucester
know
that
thou
art
come
too
soon
unless
thou
wert
more
loyal
than
thou
art
i
do
arrest
thee
of
high
treason
here
well
suffolks
duke
thou
shalt
not
see
me
blush
nor
change
my
countenance
for
this
arrest
a
heart
unspotted
is
not
easily
daunted
the
purest
spring
is
not
so
free
from
mud
as
i
am
clear
from
treason
to
my
sovereign
who
can
accuse
me
wherein
am
i
guilty
tis
thought
my
lord
that
you
took
bribes
of
france
and
being
protector
stayd
the
soldiers
pay
by
means
whereof
his
highness
hath
lost
france
is
it
but
thought
so
what
are
they
that
think
it
i
never
robbd
the
soldiers
of
their
pay
nor
ever
had
one
penny
bribe
from
france
so
help
me
god
as
i
have
watchd
the
night
ay
night
by
night
in
studying
good
for
england
that
doit
that
eer
i
wrested
from
the
king
or
any
groat
i
hoarded
to
my
use
be
brought
against
me
at
my
trialday
no
many
a
pound
of
mine
own
proper
store
because
i
would
not
tax
the
needy
commons
have
i
disbursed
to
the
garrisons
and
never
askd
for
restitution
it
serves
you
well
my
lord
to
say
so
much
i
say
no
more
than
truth
so
help
me
god
in
your
protectorship
you
did
devise
strange
tortures
for
offenders
never
heard
of
that
england
was
defamd
by
tyranny
why
tis
well
known
that
whiles
i
was
protector
pity
was
all
the
fault
that
was
in
me
for
i
should
melt
at
an
offenders
tears
and
lowly
words
were
ransom
for
their
fault
unless
it
were
a
bloody
murderer
or
foul
felonious
thief
that
fleecd
poor
passengers
i
never
gave
them
condign
punishment
murder
indeed
that
bloody
sin
i
torturd
above
the
felon
or
what
trespass
else
my
lord
these
faults
are
easy
quickly
answerd
but
mightier
crimes
are
laid
unto
your
charge
whereof
you
cannot
easily
purge
yourself
i
do
arrest
you
in
his
highness
name
and
here
commit
you
to
my
lord
cardinal
to
keep
until
your
further
time
of
trial
my
lord
of
gloucester
tis
my
special
hope
that
you
will
clear
yourself
from
all
suspect
my
conscience
tells
me
you
are
innocent
ah
gracious
lord
these
days
are
dangerous
virtue
is
chokd
with
foul
ambition
and
charity
chasd
hence
by
rancours
hand
foul
subornation
is
predominant
and
equity
exild
your
highness
land
i
know
their
complot
is
to
have
my
life
and
if
my
death
might
make
this
island
happy
and
prove
the
period
of
their
tyranny
i
would
expend
it
with
all
willingness
but
mine
is
made
the
prologue
to
their
play
for
thousands
more
that
yet
suspect
no
peril
will
not
conclude
their
plotted
tragedy
beauforts
red
sparkling
eyes
blab
his
hearts
malice
and
suffolks
cloudy
brow
his
stormy
hate
sharp
buckingham
unburdens
with
his
tongue
the
envious
load
that
lies
upon
his
heart
and
dogged
york
that
reaches
at
the
moon
whose
overweening
arm
i
have
pluckd
back
by
false
accuse
doth
level
at
my
life
and
you
my
sovreign
lady
with
the
rest
causeless
have
laid
disgraces
on
my
head
and
with
your
best
endeavour
have
stirrd
up
my
liefest
liege
to
be
mine
enemy
ay
all
of
you
have
laid
your
heads
together
myself
had
notice
of
your
conventicles
and
all
to
make
away
my
guiltless
life
i
shall
not
want
false
witness
to
condemn
me
nor
store
of
treasons
to
augment
my
guilt
the
ancient
proverb
will
be
well
effected
a
staff
is
quickly
found
to
beat
a
dog
my
liege
his
railing
is
intolerable
if
those
that
care
to
keep
your
royal
person
from
treasons
secret
knife
and
traitors
rage
be
thus
upbraided
chid
and
rated
at
and
the
offender
granted
scope
of
speech
twill
make
them
cool
in
zeal
unto
your
grace
hath
he
not
twit
our
sovereign
lady
here
with
ignominious
words
though
clerkly
couchd
as
if
she
had
suborned
some
to
swear
false
allegations
to
oerthrow
his
state
but
i
can
give
the
loser
leave
to
chide
far
truer
spoke
than
meant
i
lose
indeed
beshrew
the
winners
for
they
playd
me
false
and
well
such
losers
may
have
leave
to
speak
hell
wrest
the
sense
and
hold
us
here
all
day
lord
cardinal
he
is
your
prisoner
sirs
take
away
the
duke
and
guard
him
sure
ah
thus
king
henry
throws
away
his
crutch
before
his
legs
be
firm
to
bear
his
body
thus
is
the
shepherd
beaten
from
thy
side
and
wolves
are
gnarling
who
shall
gnaw
thee
first
ah
that
my
fear
were
false
ah
that
it
were
for
good
king
henry
thy
decay
i
fear
my
lords
what
to
your
wisdoms
seemeth
best
do
or
undo
as
if
ourself
were
here
what
will
your
highness
leave
the
parliament
ay
margaret
my
heart
is
drownd
with
grief
whose
flood
begins
to
flow
within
mine
eyes
my
body
round
engirt
with
misery
for
whats
more
miserable
than
discontent
ah
uncle
humphrey
in
thy
face
i
see
the
map
of
honour
truth
and
loyalty
and
yet
good
humphrey
is
the
hour
to
come
that
eer
i
provd
thee
false
or
feard
thy
faith
what
lowring
star
now
envies
thy
estate
that
these
great
lords
and
margaret
our
queen
do
seek
subversion
of
thy
harmless
life
thou
never
didst
them
wrong
nor
no
man
wrong
and
as
the
butcher
takes
away
the
calf
and
binds
the
wretch
and
beats
it
when
it
strays
bearing
it
to
the
bloody
slaughterhouse
even
so
remorseless
have
they
borne
him
hence
and
as
the
dam
runs
lowing
up
and
down
looking
the
way
her
harmless
young
one
went
and
can
do
nought
but
wail
her
darlings
loss
even
so
myself
bewails
good
gloucesters
case
with
sad
unhelpful
tears
and
with
dimmd
eyes
look
after
him
and
cannot
do
him
good
so
mighty
are
his
vowed
enemies
his
fortunes
i
will
weep
and
twixt
each
groan
say
whos
a
traitor
gloucester
he
is
none
fair
lords
cold
snow
melts
with
the
suns
hot
beams
henry
my
lord
is
cold
in
great
affairs
too
full
of
foolish
pity
and
gloucesters
show
beguiles
him
as
the
mournful
crocodile
with
sorrow
snares
relenting
passengers
or
as
the
snake
rolld
in
a
flowring
bank
with
shining
checkerd
slough
doth
sting
a
child
that
for
the
beauty
thinks
it
excellent
believe
me
lords
were
none
more
wise
than
i
and
yet
herein
i
judge
mine
own
wit
good
this
gloucester
should
be
quickly
rid
the
world
to
rid
us
from
the
fear
we
have
of
him
that
he
should
die
is
worthy
policy
and
yet
we
want
a
colour
for
his
death
tis
meet
he
be
condemnd
by
course
of
law
but
in
my
mind
that
were
no
policy
the
king
will
labour
still
to
save
his
life
the
commons
haply
rise
to
save
his
life
and
yet
we
have
but
trivial
argument
more
than
mistrust
that
shows
him
worthy
death
so
that
by
this
you
would
not
have
him
die
ah
york
no
man
alive
so
fain
as
i
tis
york
that
hath
more
reason
for
his
death
but
my
lord
cardinal
and
you
my
lord
of
suffolk
say
as
you
think
and
speak
it
from
your
souls
weret
not
all
one
an
empty
eagle
were
set
to
guard
the
chicken
from
a
hungry
kite
as
place
duke
humphrey
for
the
kings
protector
so
the
poor
chicken
should
be
sure
of
death
madam
tis
true
and
weret
not
madness
then
to
make
the
fox
surveyor
of
the
fold
who
being
accusd
a
crafty
murderer
his
guilt
should
be
but
idly
posted
over
because
his
purpose
is
not
executed
no
let
him
die
in
that
he
is
a
fox
by
nature
provd
an
enemy
to
the
flock
before
his
chaps
be
staind
with
crimson
blood
as
humphrey
provd
by
reasons
to
my
liege
and
do
not
stand
on
quillets
how
to
slay
him
be
it
by
gins
by
snares
by
subtilty
sleeping
or
waking
tis
no
matter
how
so
he
be
dead
for
that
is
good
deceit
which
mates
him
first
that
first
intends
deceit
thrice
noble
suffolk
tis
resolutely
spoke
not
resolute
except
so
much
were
done
for
things
are
often
spoke
and
seldom
meant
but
that
my
heart
accordeth
with
my
tongue
seeing
the
deed
is
meritorious
and
to
preserve
my
sovereign
from
his
foe
say
but
the
word
and
i
will
be
his
priest
but
i
would
have
him
dead
my
lord
of
suffolk
ere
you
can
take
due
orders
for
a
priest
say
you
consent
and
censure
well
the
deed
and
ill
provide
his
executioner
i
tender
so
the
safety
of
my
liege
here
is
my
hand
the
deed
is
worthy
doing
and
so
say
i
and
i
and
now
we
three
have
spoke
it
it
skills
not
greatly
who
impugns
our
doom
great
lords
from
ireland
am
i
come
amain
to
signify
that
rebels
there
are
up
and
put
the
englishmen
unto
the
sword
send
succours
lords
and
stop
the
rage
betime
before
the
wound
do
grow
uncurable
for
being
green
there
is
great
hope
of
help
a
breach
that
craves
a
quick
expedient
stop
what
counsel
give
you
in
this
weighty
cause
that
somerset
be
sent
as
regent
thither
tis
meet
that
lucky
ruler
be
employd
witness
the
fortune
he
hath
had
in
france
if
york
with
all
his
farfet
policy
had
been
the
regent
there
instead
of
me
he
never
would
have
stayd
in
france
so
long
no
not
to
lose
it
all
as
thou
hast
done
i
rather
would
have
lost
my
life
betimes
than
bring
a
burden
of
dishonour
home
by
staying
there
so
long
till
all
were
lost
show
me
one
scar
characterd
on
thy
skin
mens
flesh
preservd
so
whole
do
seldom
win
nay
then
this
spark
will
prove
a
raging
fire
if
wind
and
fuel
be
brought
to
feed
it
with
no
more
good
york
sweet
somerset
be
still
thy
fortune
york
hadst
thou
been
regent
there
might
happily
have
provd
far
worse
than
his
what
worse
than
nought
nay
then
a
shame
take
all
and
in
the
number
thee
that
wishest
shame
my
lord
of
york
try
what
your
fortune
is
the
uncivil
kerns
of
ireland
are
in
arms
and
temper
clay
with
blood
of
englishmen
to
ireland
will
you
lead
a
band
of
men
collected
choicely
from
each
county
some
and
try
your
hap
against
the
irishmen
i
will
my
lord
so
please
his
majesty
why
our
authority
is
his
consent
and
what
we
do
establish
he
confirms
then
noble
york
take
thou
this
task
in
hand
i
am
content
provide
me
soldiers
lords
whiles
i
take
order
for
mine
own
affairs
a
charge
lord
york
that
i
will
see
performd
but
now
return
we
to
the
false
duke
humphrey
no
more
of
him
for
i
will
deal
with
him
that
henceforth
he
shall
trouble
us
no
more
and
so
break
off
the
day
is
almost
spent
lord
suffolk
you
and
i
must
talk
of
that
event
my
lord
of
suffolk
within
fourteen
days
at
bristol
i
expect
my
soldiers
for
there
ill
ship
them
all
for
ireland
ill
see
it
truly
done
my
lord
of
york
now
york
or
never
steel
thy
fearful
thoughts
and
change
misdoubt
to
resolution
be
that
thou
hopst
to
be
or
what
thou
art
resign
to
death
it
is
not
worth
the
enjoying
let
palefacd
fear
keep
with
the
meanborn
man
and
find
no
harbour
in
a
royal
heart
faster
than
springtime
showers
comes
thought
on
thought
and
not
a
thought
but
thinks
on
dignity
my
brain
more
busy
than
the
labouring
spider
weaves
tedious
snares
to
trap
mine
enemies
well
nobles
well
tis
politicly
done
to
send
me
packing
with
a
host
of
men
i
fear
me
you
but
warm
the
starved
snake
who
cherishd
in
your
breasts
will
sting
your
hearts
twas
men
i
lackd
and
you
will
give
them
me
i
take
it
kindly
yet
be
well
assurd
you
put
sharp
weapons
in
a
madmans
hands
whiles
i
in
ireland
nourish
a
mighty
band
i
will
stir
up
in
england
some
black
storm
shall
blow
ten
thousand
souls
to
heaven
or
hell
and
this
fell
tempest
shall
not
cease
to
rage
until
the
golden
circuit
on
my
head
like
to
the
glorious
suns
transparent
beams
do
calm
the
fury
of
this
madbred
flaw
and
for
a
minister
of
my
intent
i
have
seducd
a
headstrong
kentishman
john
cade
of
ashford
to
make
commotion
as
full
well
he
can
under
the
title
of
john
mortimer
in
ireland
have
i
seen
this
stubborn
cade
oppose
himself
against
a
troop
of
kerns
and
fought
so
long
till
that
his
thighs
with
darts
were
almost
like
a
sharpquilld
porpentine
and
in
the
end
being
rescud
i
have
seen
him
caper
upright
like
a
wild
morisco
shaking
the
bloody
darts
as
he
his
bells
full
often
like
a
shaghaird
crafty
kern
hath
he
conversed
with
the
enemy
and
undiscoverd
come
to
me
again
and
given
me
notice
of
their
villanies
this
devil
here
shall
be
my
substitute
for
that
john
mortimer
which
now
is
dead
in
face
in
gait
in
speech
he
doth
resemble
by
this
i
shall
perceive
the
commons
mind
how
they
affect
the
house
and

for
myself
foe

was
to

sighs
and
all
to

no
loathsome
leper
look
on
me
what
art
thou
like
the
adder
waxen
deaf
be
poisonous
too
and
kill
thy
forlorn
queen
is
all
thy
comfort
shut
in
gloucesters
tomb
why
then
dame
margaret
was
neer
thy
joy
erect
his
statua
and
worship
it
and
make
my
image
but
an
alehouse
sign
was
i
for
this
nigh
wrackd
upon
the
sea
and
twice
by
awkward
wind
from
englands
bank
drove
back
again
unto
my
native
clime
what
boded
this
but
well
forewarning
wind
did
seem
to
say
seek
not
a
scorpions
nest
nor
set
no
footing
on
this
unkind
shore
what
did
i
then
but
cursd
the
gentle
gusts
and
he
that
loosd
them
forth
their
brazen
caves
and
bid
them
blow
towards
englands
blessed
shore
or
turn
our
stern
upon
a
dreadful
rock
yet
olus
would
not
be
a
murderer
but
left
that
hateful
office
unto
thee
the
pretty
vaulting
sea
refusd
to
drown
me
knowing
that
thou
wouldst
have
me
drownd
on
shore
with
tears
as
salt
as
sea
through
thy
unkindness
the
splitting
rocks
cowerd
in
the
sinking
sands
and
would
not
dash
me
with
their
ragged
sides
because
thy
flinty
heart
more
hard
than
they
might
in
thy
palace
perish
margaret
as
far
as
i
could
ken
thy
chalky
cliffs
when
from
thy
shore
the
tempest
beat
us
back
i
stood
upon
the
hatches
in
the
storm
and
when
the
dusky
sky
began
to
rob
my
earnestgaping
sight
of
thy
lands
view
i
took
a
costly
jewel
from
my
neck
a
heart
it
was
bound
in
with
diamonds
and
threw
it
towards
thy
land
the
sea
receivd
it
and
so
i
wishd
thy
body
might
my
heart
and
even
with
this
i
lost
fair
englands
view
and
bid
mine
eyes
be
packing
with
my
heart
and
calld
them
blind
and
dusky
spectacles
for
losing
ken
of
albions
wished
coast
how
often
have
i
tempted
suffolks
tongue
the
agent
of
thy
foul
inconstancy
to
sit
and
witch
me
as
ascanius
did
when
he
to
madding
dido
would
unfold
his
fathers
acts
commencd
in
burning
troy
am
i
not
witchd
like
her
or
thou
not
false
like
him
ay
me
i
can
no
more
die
margaret
for
henry
weeps
that
thou
dost
live
so
long
it
is
reported
mighty
sovereign
that
good
duke
humphrey
traitrously
is
murderd
by
suffolk
and
the
cardinal
beauforts
means
the
commons
like
an
angry
hive
of
bees
that
want
their
leader
scatter
up
and
down
and
care
not
who
they
sting
in
his
revenge
myself
have
calmd
their
spleenful
mutiny
until
they
hear
the
order
of
his
death
that
he
is
dead
good
warwick
tis
too
true
but
how
he
died
god
knows
not
henry
enter
his
chamber
view
his
breathless
corpse
and
comment
then
upon
his
sudden
death
that
shall
i
do
my
liege
stay
salisbury
with
the
rude
multitude
till
i
return
o
thou
that
judgest
all
things
stay
my
thoughts
my
thoughts
that
labour
to
persuade
my
soul
some
violent
hands
were
laid
on
humphreys
life
if
my
suspect
be
false
forgive
me
god
for
judgment
only
doth
belong
to
thee
fain
would
i
go
to
chafe
his
paly
lips
with
twenty
thousand
kisses
and
to
drain
upon
his
face
an
ocean
of
salt
tears
to
tell
my
love
unto
his
deaf
dumb
trunk
and
with
my
fingers
feel
his
hand
unfeeling
but
all
in
vain
are
these
mean
obsequies
and
to
survey
his
dead
and
earthly
image
what
were
it
but
to
make
my
sorrow
greater
come
hither
gracious
sovereign
view
this
body
that
is
to
see
how
deep
my
grave
is
made
for
with
his
soul
fled
all
my
worldly
solace
for
seeing
him
i
see
my
life
in
death
as
surely
as
my
soul
intends
to
live
with
that
dread
king
that
took
our
state
upon
him
to
free
us
from
his
fathers
wrathful
curse
i
do
believe
that
violent
hands
were
laid
upon
the
life
of
this
thricefamed
duke
a
dreadful
oath
sworn
with
a
solemn
tongue
what
instance
gives
lord
warwick
for
his
vow
see
how
the
blood
is
settled
in
his
face
oft
have
i
seen
a
timelyparted
ghost
of
ashy
semblance
meagre
pale
and
bloodless
being
all
descended
to
the
labouring
heart
who
in
the
conflict
that
it
holds
with
death
attracts
the
same
for
aidance
gainst
the
enemy
which
with
the
heart
there
cools
and
neer
returneth
to
blush
and
beautify
the
cheek
again
but
see
his
face
is
black
and
full
of
blood
his
eyeballs
further
out
than
when
he
livd
staring
full
ghastly
like
a
strangled
man
his
hair
upreard
his
nostrils
stretchd
with
struggling
his
hands
abroad
displayd
as
one
that
graspd
and
tuggd
for
life
and
was
by
strength
subdud
look
on
the
sheets
his
hair
you
see
is
sticking
his
wellproportiond
beard
made
rough
and
rugged
like
to
the
summers
corn
by
tempest
lodgd
it
cannot
be
but
he
was
murderd
here
the
least
of
all
these
signs
were
probable
why
warwick
who
should
do
the
duke
to
death
myself
and
beaufort
had
him
in
protection
and
we
i
hope
sir
are
no
murderers
but
both
of
you
were
vowd
duke
humphreys
foes
and
you
forsooth
had
the
good
duke
to
keep
tis
like
you
would
not
feast
him
like
a
friend
and
tis
well
seen
he
found
an
enemy
then
you
belike
suspect
these
noblemen
as
guilty
of
duke
humphreys
timeless
death
who
finds
the
heifer
dead
and
bleeding
fresh
and
sees
fast
by
a
butcher
with
an
axe
but
will
suspect
twas
he
that
made
the
slaughter
who
finds
the
partridge
in
the
puttocks
nest
but
may
imagine
how
the
bird
was
dead
although
the
kite
soar
with
unbloodied
beak
even
so
suspicious
is
this
tragedy
are
you
the
butcher
suffolk
wheres
your
knife
is
beaufort
termd
a
kite
where
are
his
talons
i
wear
no
knife
to
slaughter
sleeping
men
but
heres
a
vengeful
sword
rusted
with
ease
that
shall
be
scoured
in
his
rancorous
heart
that
slanders
me
with
murders
crimson
badge
say
if
thou
darst
proud
lord
of
warwickshire
that
i
am
faulty
in
duke
humphreys
death
what
dares
not
warwick
if
false
suffolk
dare
him
he
dares
not
calm
his
contumelious
spirit
nor
cease
to
be
an
arrogant
controller
though
suffolk
dare
him
twenty
thousand
times
madam
be
still
with
reverence
may
i
say
for
every
word
you
speak
in
his
behalf
is
slander
to
your
royal
dignity
bluntwitted
lord
ignoble
in
demeanour
if
ever
lady
wrongd
her
lord
so
much
thy
mother
took
into
her
blameful
bed
some
stern
untutord
churl
and
noble
stock
was
graft
with
crabtree
slip
whose
fruit
thou
art
and
never
of
the
nevils
noble
race
but
that
the
guilt
of
murder
bucklers
thee
and
i
should
rob
the
deathsman
of
his
fee
quitting
thee
thereby
of
ten
thousand
shames
and
that
my
sovreigns
presence
makes
me
mild
i
would
false
murdrous
coward
on
thy
knee
make
thee
beg
pardon
for
thy
passed
speech
and
say
it
was
thy
mother
that
thou
meantst
that
thou
thyself
wast
born
in
bastardy
and
after
all
this
fearful
homage
done
give
thee
thy
hire
and
send
thy
soul
to
hell
pernicious
bloodsucker
of
sleeping
men
thou
shalt
be
waking
while
i
shed
thy
blood
if
from
this
presence
thou
darst
go
with
me
away
even
now
or
i
will
drag
thee
hence
unworthy
though
thou
art
ill
cope
with
thee
and
do
some
service
to
duke
humphreys
ghost
what
stronger
breastplate
than
a
heart
untainted
thrice
is
he
armd
that
hath
his
quarrel
just
and
he
but
naked
though
lockd
up
in
steel
whose
conscience
with
injustice
is
corrupted
what
noise
is
this
why
how
now
lords
your
wrathful
weapons
drawn
here
in
our
presence
dare
you
be
so
bold
why
what
tumultuous
clamour
have
we
here
the
traitorous
warwick
with
the
men
of
bury
set
all
upon
me
mighty
sovereign
sirs
stand
apart
the
king
shall
know
your
mind
dread
lord
the
commons
send
you
word
by
me
unless
false
suffolk
straight
be
done
to
death
or
banished
fair
englands
territories
they
will
by
violence
tear
him
from
your
palace
and
torture
him
with
grievous
lingering
death
they
say
by
him
the
good
duke
humphrey
died
they
say
in
him
they
fear
your
highness
death
and
mere
instinct
of
love
and
loyalty
free
from
a
stubborn
opposite
intent
as
being
thought
to
contradict
your
liking
makes
them
thus
forward
in
his
banishment
they
say
in
care
of
your
most
royal
person
that
if
your
highness
should
intend
to
sleep
and
charge
that
no
man
should
disturb
your
rest
in
pain
of
your
dislike
or
pain
of
death
yet
notwithstanding
such
a
strait
edict
were
there
a
serpent
seen
with
forked
tongue
that
slily
glided
towards
your
majesty
it
were
but
necessary
you
were
wakd
lest
being
sufferd
in
that
harmful
slumber
the
mortal
worm
might
make
the
sleep
eternal
and
therefore
do
they
cry
though
you
forbid
that
they
will
guard
you
wher
you
will
or
no
from
such
fell
serpents
as
false
suffolk
is
with
whose
envenomed
and
fatal
sting
your
loving
uncle
twenty
times
his
worth
they
say
is
shamefully
bereft
of
life
an
answer
from
the
king
my
lord
of
salisbury
tis
like
the
commons
rude
unpolishd
hinds
could
send
such
message
to
their
sovereign
but
you
my
lord
were
glad
to
be
employd
to
show
how
quaint
an
orator
you
are
but
all
the
honour
salisbury
hath
won
is
that
he
was
the
lord
ambassador
sent
from
a
sort
of
tinkers
to
the
king
an
answer
from
the
king
or
we
will
all
break
in
go
salisbury
and
tell
them
all
from
me
i
thank
them
for
their
tender
loving
care
and
had
i
not
been
cited
so
by
them
yet
did
i
purpose
as
they
do
entreat
for
sure
my
thoughts
do
hourly
prophesy
mischance
unto
my
state
by
suffolks
means
and
therefore
by
his
majesty
i
swear
whose
far
unworthy
deputy
i
am
he
shall
not
breathe
infection
in
this
air
but
three
days
longer
on
the
pain
of
death
o
henry
let
me
plead
for
gentle
suffolk
ungentle
queen
to
call
him
gentle
suffolk
no
more
i
say
if
thou
dost
plead
for
him
thou
wilt
but
add
increase
unto
my
wrath
had
i
but
said
i
would
have
kept
my
word
but
when
i
swear
it
is
irrevocable
if
after
three
days
space
thou
here
best
found
on
any
ground
that
i
am
ruler
of
the
world
shall
not
be
ransom
for
thy
life
come
warwick
come
good
warwick
go
with
me
i
have
great
matters
to
impart
to
thee
mischance
and
sorrow
go
along
with
you
hearts
discontent
and
sour
affliction
be
playfellows
to
keep
you
company
theres
two
of
you
the
devil
make
a
third
and
threefold
vengeance
tend
upon
your
steps
cease
gentle
queen
these
execrations
and
let
thy
suffolk
take
his
heavy
leave
fie
coward
woman
and
softhearted
wretch
hast
thou
not
spirit
to
curse
thine
enemy
a
plague
upon
them
wherefore
should
i
curse
them
would
curses
kill
as
doth
the
mandrakes
groan
i
would
invent
as
bittersearching
terms
as
curst
as
harsh
and
horrible
to
hear
deliverd
strongly
through
my
fixed
teeth
with
full
as
many
signs
of
deadly
hate
as
leanfacd
envy
in
her
loathsome
cave
my
tongue
should
stumble
in
mine
earnest
words
mine
eyes
should
sparkle
like
the
beaten
flint
my
hair
be
fixd
on
end
as
one
distract
ay
every
joint
should
seem
to
curse
and
ban
and
even
now
my
burdend
heart
would
break
should
i
not
curse
them
poison
be
their
drink
gall
worse
than
gall
the
daintiest
that
they
taste
their
sweetest
shade
a
grove
of
cypress
trees
their
chiefest
prospect
murdering
basilisks
their
softest
touch
as
smart
as
lizards
stings
their
music
frightful
as
the
serpents
hiss
and
boding
screechowls
make
the
concert
full
all
the
foul
terrors

you
bid
me
leave

by
the
ground
that
i

could
i
curse
away
a
winters
night
though
standing
naked
on
a
mountain
top
where
biting
cold
would
never
let
grass
grow
and
think
it
but
a
minute
spent
in
sport
o
let
me
entreat
thee
cease
give
me
thy
hand
that
i
may
dew
it
with
my
mournful
tears
nor
let
the
rain
of
heaven
wet
this
place
to
wash
away
my
woeful
monuments
o
could
this
kiss
be
printed
in
thy
hand
that
thou
mightst
think
upon
these
by
the
seal
through
whom
a
thousand
sighs
are
breathd
for
thee
so
get
thee
gone

standing
by

one
that
surfeits
thinking
on
a
want

repeal
thee

the

by
a
beggarwoman
stoln
away
and
ignorant
of
his
birth
and

a
bricklayer
when
he
came
to
age
his
son
am
i
deny
it
if
you

nay
tis
too
true
therefore
he
shall
be
king
sir
he
made
a
chimney
in
my
fathers
house
and
the
bricks
are
alive
at
this
day
to
testify
it

it
not

you
credit
this
base
drudges

we
therefore

i
invented
it
myself
go

in
whose
time

went
to
spancounter
for
french
crowns
i
am
content
he
shall
reign
but
ill
be
protector
over
him
and
furthermore
well
have
the
lord
says
head
for
selling
the
dukedom
of
maine
and
good
reason
for
thereby
is
england
mained
and
fain
to
go
with
a
staff
but
that
my
puissance
holds
it
up
fellow
kings
i
tell
you
that
that
lord
say
hath
gelded
the
commonwealth
and
made
it
a
eunuch
and
more
than
that
he
can
speak
french
and
therefore
he
is
a
traitor
o
gross
and
miserable
ignorance
nay
answer
if
you
can
the
frenchmen
are
our
enemies
go
to

he
that
speaks

the
tongue
of

with
the
army
of
the
king
herald
away

battle
ends
may
even
in
their
wives
and
childrens
sight
be
hangd
up
for
example
at
their
doors

clouted
shoon
for
they
are
thrifty
honest
men
and
such
as

but
that
they
dare
not
take
our
parts
they

on
revenge
and
cease
to
weep
but
who

cease
to
weep
and

a
grammarschool

no
other
books
but
the
score

caused

contrary
to
the

his
crown
and
dignity
thou
hast
built
a
papermill

will
be
proved
to
thy
face
that
thou
hast
men
about
thee

usually
talk
of

such
abominable
words

no
christian
car
can
endure
to
hear
thou
hast
appointed
justices
of
peace
to
call
poor
men
before
them
about
matters
they
were
not
able
to

thou
hast
put
them
in
prison
and
because
they
could
not
read
thou
hast
hanged
them
when
indeed
only
for
that
cause
they
have
been
most
worthy
to
live
thou
dost
ride
on
a
footcloth
dost
thou
not
what
of
that
marry
thou
oughtest
not
to
let
thy

in
proud
array
and
still
proclaimeth
as
he
comes
along
his
arms
are
only
to
remove
from

the
duke
of
somerset
whom
he
terms
a
traitor
thus
stands
my
state
twixt
cade
and
york
distressd
like
to
a
ship
that
having
scapd
a
tempest
is
straight
way
calmd
and

whats
the
reason
of
these
arms

lord
ill
yield
myself
to
prison
willingly
or
unto
death
to
do
my
country
good
in
any
case
be
not
too
rough
in
terms
for
he
is
fierce
and
cannot
brook
hard
language
i
will
my
lord
and
doubt
not
so
to
deal
as
all
things
shall
redound
unto
your
good
come
wife
lets
in
and
learn
to
govern
better
for
yet
may
england
curse
my
wretched
reign
fie
on
ambition
fie
on
myself
that
have
a
sword
and
yet
am
ready
to
famish
these
five
days
have
i
hid
me
in
these
woods
and
durst
not
peep
out
for
all
the
country
is
laid
for
me
but
now
i
am
so
hungry
that
if
i
might
have
a
lease
of
my
life
for
a
thousand
years
i
could
stay
no
longer
wherefore
on
a
brick
wall
have
i
climbed
into
this
garden
to
see
if
i
can
eat
grass
or
pick
a
sallet
another
while
which
is
not
amiss
to
cool
a
mans
stomach
this
hot
weather
and
i
think
this
word
sallet
was
born
to
do
me
good
for
many
a
time
but
for
a
sallet
my
brainpan
had
been
cleft
with
a
brown
bill
and
many
a
time
when
i
have
been
dry
and
bravely
marching
it
hath
served
me
instead
of
a
quartpot
to
drink
in
and
now
the
word
sallet
must
serve
me
to
feed
on
lord
who
would
live
turmoiled
in
the
court
and
may
enjoy
such
quiet
walks
as
these
this
small
inheritance
my
father
left
me
contenteth
me
and
worth
a
monarchy
i
seek
not
to
wax
great
by
others
waning
or
gather
wealth
i
care
not
with
what
envy
sufficeth
that
i
have
maintains
my
state
and
sends
the
poor
well
pleased
from
my
gate
heres
the
lord
of
the
soil
come
to
seize
me
for
a
stray
for
entering
his
feesimple
without
leave
ah
villain
thou
wilt
betray
me
and
get
a
thousand
crowns
of
the
king
by
carrying
my
head
to
him
but
ill
make
thee
eat
iron
like
an
ostrich
and
swallow
my
sword
like
a
great
pin
ere
thou
and
i
part
why
rude
companion
whatsoeer
thou
be
i
know
thee
not
why
then
should
i
betray
thee
ist
not
enough
to
break
into
my
garden
and
like
a
thief
to
come
to
rob
my
grounds
climbing
my
walls
in
spite
of
me
the
owner
but
thou
wilt
brave
me
with
these
saucy
terms
brave
thee
ay
by
the
best
blood
that
ever
was
broached
and
beard
thee
too

on
me
well

no
meat

five
days

five
men

may
never
eat
grass
more
nay
it
shall
neer

thy

diggd
already
in

earth
as
for
more
words
whose

by
my
valour
the
most
complete
champion
that
ever
i
heard

if
thou
turn

edge
or

burlyboned
clown

lost
and
ill
defy
them
all
wither

and
be
henceforth
a
buryingplace
to
all

hallow
thee
for
this
thy
deed
and
hang
thee
oer
my
tomb
when
i
am
dead

this
blood
be
wiped
from
thy
point
but
thou
shalt
wear
it

ungracious
head
which
i
will
bear
in
triumph
to
the
king

here
buckingham
to
disturb

i
must
dissemble

if
thou
meanest
well
i
greet
thee
well
humphrey
of
buckingham
i
accept
thy
greeting
art
thou
a
messenger
or
come
of
pleasure
a
messenger
from
henry
our
dread
hege
to
know
the
reason
of
these
arms
in
peace
or
why
thou
being
a
subject
as
i
am
against
thy
oath
and
true
allegiance
sworn
shouldst
raise
so
great
a
power
without
his
leave
or
dare
to
bring
thy
force
so
near
the
court
scarce
can
i
speak
my
choler
is
so
great
o
i
could
hew
up
rocks
and
fight
with
flint
i
am
so
angry
at
these
abject
terms
and
now
like
ajax
telamonius
on
sheep
or
oxen
could
i
spend
my
fury
i
am
far
better
born
than
is
the
king
more
like
a
king
more
kingly
in
my
thoughts
but
i
must
make
fair
weather
yet
awhile
till
henry
be
more
weak
and
i
more
strong
buckingham
i
prithee
pardon
me
that
i
have
given
no
answer
all
this
while
my
mind
was
troubled
with
deep
melancholy
the
cause
why
i
have
brought
this
army
hither
is
to
remove
proud
somerset
from
the
king
seditious
to
his
grace
and
to
the
state
that
is
too
much
presumption
on
thy
part
but
if
thy
arms
be
to
no
other
end
the
king
hath
yielded
unto
thy
demand
the
duke
of
somerset
is
in
the
tower
upon
thine
honour

what
wilt
thou
on
thy
deathbed
play
the
ruffian
and
seek
for
sorrow
with
thy
spectacles
o
where
is
faith
o
where
is
loyalty
if
it
be
banishd
from
the
frosty
head
where
shall
it
find
a
harbour
in

earth
wilt
thou
go
dig
a
grave
to
find
out
war
and
shame
thine
honourable
age
with

why
art
thou
old

in

bend
thy

to
me
that
bows
unto
the
grave
with

age
my

this
most
renowned
duke

conscience
do
repute
his
grace
the
rightful
heir
to
englands
royal
seat
hast
thou
not
sworn
allegiance
unto
me
i
have
canst
thou
dispense
with
heaven
for
such
an
oath
it
is
great
sin
to
swear
unto
a
sin
but
greater
sin
to
keep
a
sinful
oath
who
can
be
bound
by
any
solemn
vow
to
do
a
murderous
deed
to
rob
a
man
to
force
a
spotless
virgins
chastity
to
reave
the
orphan
of
his
patrimony
to
wring
the
widow
from
her
customd
right
and
have
no
other
reason
for
this
wrong
but
that
he
was
bound
by
a
solemn
oath
a
subtle
traitor
needs
no
sophister
call
buckingham
and
bid
him
arm
himself
call
buckingham
and
all
the
friends
thou
hast
i
am
resolvd
for
death
or
dignity
the
first
i
warrant
thee
if
dreams
prove
true
you
were
best
to
go
to
bed
and
dream
again
to
keep
thee
from
the
tempest
of
the
field
i
am
resolvd
to
bear
a
greater
storm
than
any
thou
canst
conjure
up
today
and
that
ill
write
upon
thy
burgonet
might
i
but
know
thee
by
thy
household
badge
now
by
my
fathers
badge

the
rampant
bear
chaind
to
the
ragged

this
day
ill
wear
aloft
my
burgonet
as
on
a
mountaintop
the
cedar
shows
that
keeps
his
leaves
in
spite
of
any
storm
even
to
affright
thee
with
the
view
thereof
and
from
thy
burgonet
ill
rend
thy
bear
and
tread
it
underfoot
with
all
contempt
despite
the
bearward
that
protects
the

and
so
to

to
quell
the

thee
from

now
when

clifford
i
say
come
forth
and
fight
with
me
proud
northern
lord
clifford
of
cumberland
warwick
is
hoarse
with
calling
thee
to
arms
how
now
my
noble
lord
what
all

the
deadlyhanded
clifford
slew
my
steed
but
match
to

i
have
encounterd
him
and
made
a
prey
for
carrion
kites
and
crows
even
of

crown
thou
fightst
as

today
it
grieves
my
soul
to
leave

unassaild
what
seest
thou
in

york
why
dost
thou
pause
with
thy
brave
bearing
should
i
be
in
love
but
that
thou
art
so
fast
mine
enemy
nor
should
thy
prowess
want
praise
and
esteem
but
that
tis
shown
ignobly
and
in
treason
so
let
it
help
me
now
against
thy
sword
as
i
in
justice
and
true
right
express
it
my
soul
and
body
on
the
action

a
dreadful
lay

disorder
wounds
where

whom
angry
heavens
do
make
their
minister
throw
in
the
frozen
bosoms
of
our
part
hot
coals
of
vengeance
let
no
soldier
fly
he
that
is
truly
dedicate
to
war
hath
no
selflove
nor
he
that
loves
himself
hath
not
essentially
but
by
circumstance
the
name
of
valour
o
let
the
vile
world
end
and
the
premised
flames
of
the
last
day
knit
heaven
and

together
now
let
the
general

blow
his
blast
particularities

to
cease
wast
thou
ordaind
dear

to
lose
thy
youth
in
peace
and
to
achieve
the
silver
livery
of
advised
age
and
in
thy

and
thy
chairdays
thus
to
die
in
ruffian
battle
even
at
this

my
heart
is
turnd
to
stone
and
while

it
shall

and
beauty
that
the
tyrant
oft
reclaims

to
my
flaming
wrath
be

henceforth
i
will
not
have

into

what
we
can
which

no
more
but
fly

we
shall
to
london
get
where
you
are
lovd

this
breach
now
in

be
stoppd
but
that

mischief
set
i
would
speak
blasphemy
ere

my
lord
away
of
salisbury
who
can
report
of
him
that
winter
lion
who
in

of
time
and
like
a
gallant
in
the
brow
of

still
where

in
a
homely
house

away
we
may
not
linger
thus
poor
queen
how
love
to
me
and
to
her
son
hath
made
her
break
out
into
terms
of
rage
revengd
may
she
be
on
that
hateful
duke
whose
haughty
spirit
winged
with
desire
will
cost
my
crown
and
like
an
empty
eagle
tire
on
the
flesh
of
me
and
of
my
son
the
loss
of
those
three
lords
torments
my
heart
ill
write
unto
them
and
entreat
them
fair
come
cousin
you
shall
be
the
messenger
and
i
i
hope
shall
reconcile
them
all
brother
though
i
be
youngest
give
me
leave
no
i
can
better
play
the
orator
but
i
have
reasons
strong
and
forcible
why
how
now
sons
and
brother
at
a
strife
what
is
your
quarrel
how
began
it
first
no
quarrel
but
a
slight
contention
about
what
about
that
which
concerns
your
grace
and
us
the
crown
of
england
father
which
is
yours
mine
boy
not
till
king
henry
be
dead
your
right
depends
not
on
his
life
or
death
now
you
are
heir
therefore
enjoy
it
now
by
giving
the
house
of
lancaster
leave
to
breathe
it
will
outrun
you
father
in
the
end
i
took
an
oath
that
he
should
quietly
reign
but
for
a
kingdom
any
oath
may
be
broken
i
would
break
a
thousand
oaths
to
reign
one
year
no
god
forbid
your
grace
should
be
forsworn
i
shall
be
if
i
claim
by
open
war
ill
prove
the
contrary
if
youll
hear
me
speak
thou
canst
not
son
it
is
impossible
an
oath
is
of
no
moment
being
not
took
before
a
true
and
lawful
magistrate
that
hath
authority
over
him
that
swears
henry
had
none
but
did
usurp
the
place
then
seeing
twas
he
that
made
you
to
depose
your
oath
my
lord
is
vain
and
frivolous
therefore
to
arms
and
father
do
but
think
how
sweet
a
thing
it
is
to
wear
a
crown
within
whose
circuit
is
elysium
and
all
that
poets
feign
of
bliss
and
joy
why
do
we
linger
thus
i
cannot
rest
until
the
white
rose
that
i
wear
be
dyd
even
in
the
lukewarm
blood
of
henrys
heart
richard
enough
i
will
be
king
or
die
brother
thou
shalt
to
london
presently
and
whet
on
warwick
to
this
enterprise
thou
richard
shalt
unto
the
duke
of
norfolk
and
tell
him
privily
of
our
intent
you
edward
shall
unto
my
lord
cobham
with
whom
the
kentishmen
will
willingly
rise
in
them
i
trust
for
they
are
soldiers
witty
courteous
liberal
full
of
spirit
while
you
are
thus
employd
what
resteth
more
but
that
i
seek
occasion
how
to
rise
and
yet
the
king
not
privy
to
my
drift
nor
any
of
the
house
of
lancaster
but
stay
what
news
why
comst
thou
in
such
post
the
queen
with
all
the
northern
earls
and
lords
intend
here
to
besiege
you
in
your
castle
she
is
hard
by
with
twenty
thousand
men
and
therefore
fortify
your
hold
my
lord

with
my
sword
what
thinkst
thou
that
we
fear
them
edward
and
richard
you
shall
stay
with
me

brother
montague
shall
post
to
london
let
noble
warwick
cobham
and
the
rest
whom
we
have
left
protectors
of
the
king
with
powerful
policy
strengthen
themselves
and
trust
not
simple
henry
nor
his
oaths
brother
i
go
ill
win
them

it
not
and
thus
most
humbly
i
do
take
my
leave

and
sir
hugh

are
come
to
sandal
in
a
happy
hour

not
need
well
meet
her
in
the
field

for
a
need

our
men
in

forth
and
bid

great
i
doubt
not
uncle
of
our
victory
many
a
battle
have
i
won
in
france
when
as
the
enemy
hath
been
ten
to

thy
life
as
for
the
brat
of
this
accursed

die
and
i
my
lord
will
bear
him

he
dead
already
or
is
it
fear
that
makes
him
close
his
eyes
ill
open
them
so
looks
the
pentup
lion
oer
the
wretch
that
trembles
under
his
devouring
paws
and
so
he
walks
insulting
oer
his
prey
and
so
he
comes
to
rend
his
limbs
asunder
ah
gentle
clifford
kill
me
with
thy
sword
and
not
with
such
a
cruel
threatening
look

me
live
in
vain

speakst
poor
boy
my
fathers
blood
hath
stoppd
the
passage
where
thy
words

enter
then
let
my
fathers
blood
open
it
again
he
is
a
man
and
clifford
cope
with
him
had
i
thy
brethren
here
their
lives
and
thine
were
not
revenge
sufficient
for
me
no
if
i
diggd
up
thy
forefathers
graves
and
hung
their
rotten
coffins
up
in
chains
it
could
not
slake
mine
ire
nor
ease
my
heart
the
sight
of
any
of
the
house
of
york
is
as
a
fury
to
torment
my
soul
and
till
i
root
out
their
accursed
line
and
leave
not
one
alive
i
live
in
hell
therefore
o
let
me
pray
before
i
take
my
death
to
thee
i
pray
sweet
clifford
pity
me
such
pity
as
my
rapiers
point
affords
i
never
did
thee
harm
why
wilt
thou
slay
me
thy
father
hath
but
twas
ere
i
was
born
thou
hast
one
son
for
his
sake
pity
me
lest
in
revenge
thereof
sith
god
is
just
he
be
as
miserably
slain
as
i
ah
let
me
live
in
prison
all
my
days
and
when
i
give
occasion
of
offence
then
let
me
die
for
now

edward
to

with
purple
falchion
painted
to

richard
cried

and
cried
a
crown
or

an
earthly
sepulchre

but
out
alas

scorning
whateer
you

afflict
me
with
why
come
you
not
what
multitudes
and
fear
so
cowards
fight
when
they
can
fly
no

so
doves
do
peck
the
falcons
piercing
talons
so
desperate
thieves
all
hopeless
of
their
lives
breathe
out
invectives
gainst
the
officers
o
clifford
but
bethink
thee
once
again
and
in
thy
thought
oerrun
my
former
time
and
if
thou
canst
for
blushing
view
this
face
and
bite
thy
tongue
that
slanders
him
with
cowardice
whose
frown
hath
made
thee
faint
and
fly
ere
this
i
will
not
bandy
with
thee
word
for

but
buckle
with
thee
blows
twice
two
for
one
hold
valiant
clifford
for
a
thousand
causes
i
would
prolong
awhile
the
traitors
life
wrath
makes
him
deaf
speak
thou
northumberland
hold
clifford
do
not
honour
him
so
much
to
prick
thy
finger
though
to
wound
his
heart
what
valour
were
it
when
a
cur
doth
grin
for
one
to
thrust
his
hand
between
his
teeth
when
he
might
spurn
him
with
his
foot
away
it
is
wars
prize
to
take
all
vantages
and
ten
to

is
no
impeach
of
valour
ay
ay
so
strives
the
woodcock
with
the
gin
so
doth
the
cony
struggle
in
the
net
so
triumph
thieves
upon
their
conquerd
booty
so
true
men
yield
with
robbers
so
oermatched
what
would
your
grace
have
done
unto
him
now
brave
warriors
clifford
and
northumberland
come
make
him
stand
upon
this
molehill
here
that
raught
at
mountains
with
outstretched
arms

parted
but
the
shadow
with
his
hand
what
was
it
you
that
would
be
englands
king
wast
you
that
revelld
in
our
parliament
and
made
a
preachment
of
your
high
descent
where
are
your
mess
of
sons
to
back
you
now
the
wanton
edward
and
the
lusty
george
and
wheres
that
valiant
crookback
prodigy
dicky
your
boy
that
with
his
grumbling
voice
was
wont
to
cheer
his
dad
in
mutinies
or
with
the
rest
where
is
your
darling
rutland
look
york
i
staind
this
napkin
with
the
blood
that
valiant
clifford
with
his
rapiers
point
made
issue
from
the
bosom
of
the
boy
and
if
thine
eyes
can
water
for
his
death
i
give
thee
this
to
dry
thy
cheeks
withal
alas
poor
york
but
that
i
hate
thee
deadly
i
should
lament
thy
miserable
state
i
prithee
grieve
to
make
me
merry
york
what
hath
thy
fiery
heart
so
parchd
thine
entrails
that
not
a
tear
can
fall
for
rutlands
death
why
art
thou
patient
man
thou
shouldst
be
mad
and
i
to
make
thee
mad
do
mock
thee
thus
stamp
rave
and
fret
that
i
may
sing
and
dance
thou
wouldst
be
feed
i
see
to
make
me
sport
york
cannot
speak
unless
he
wear
a
crown
a
crown
for
york
and
lords
bow
low
to
him
hold
you
his
hands
whilst
i
do
set
it
on
ay
marry
sir
now
looks
he
like
a
king
ay
this
is
he
that
took
king
henrys
chair
and
this
is
he
was
his
adopted
heir
but
how
is
it
that
great
plantagenet
is
crownd
so
soon
and
broke
his
solemn
oath
as
i
bethink
me
you
should
not
be
king
till
our
king
henry
had
shook
hands
with
death
and
will
you
pale
your
head
in
henrys
glory
and
rob
his
temples
of
the
diadem
now
in
his
life
against
your
holy
oath
o
tis
a
fault
tootoo
unpardonable
off
with
the
crown
and
with
the
crown
his
head
and
whilst
we
breathe
take
time
to
do
him
dead
that
is
my
office
for
my
fathers
sake
nay
stay
lets
hear
the
orisons
he
makes
shewolf
of
france
but
worse
than
wolves
of
france
whose
tongue
more
poisons
than
the
adders
tooth
how
illbeseeming
is
it
in
thy
sex
to
triumph
like
an
amazonian
trull
upon
their
woes
whom
fortune
captivates
but
that
thy
face
is
visorlike
unchanging
made
impudent
with
use
of
evil
deeds
i
would
assay
proud
queen
to
make
thee
blush
to
tell
thee
whence
thou
camst
of
whom
derivd
were
shame
enough
to
shame
thee
wert
thou
not
shameless
thy
father
bears
the
type
of
king
of
naples
of
both
the
sicils
and
jerusalem
yet
not
so
wealthy
as
an
english
yeoman
hath
that
poor
monarch
taught
thee
to
insult
it
needs
not
nor
it
boots
thee
not
proud
queen
unless
the
adage
must
be
verified
that
beggars
mounted
run
their
horse
to
death
tis
beauty
that
doth
oft
make
women
proud
but
god
he
knows
thy
share
thereof
is
small
tis
virtue
that
doth
make
them
most
admird
the
contrary
doth
make
thee
wonderd
at
tis
government
that
makes
them
seem
divine
the
want
thereof
makes
thee
abominable
thou
art
as
opposite
to
every
good
as
the
antipodes
are
unto
us
or
as
the
south
to
the
septentrion
o
tigers
heart
wrappd
in
a
womans
hide
how
couldst
thou
drain
the
lifeblood
of
the
child
to
bid
the
father
wipe
his
eyes
withal
and
yet
be
seen
to
bear
a
womans
face
women
are
soft
mild
pitiful
and
flexible
thou
stern
obdurate
flinty
rough
remorseless
biddst
thou
me
rage
why
now
thou
hast
thy
wish
wouldst
have
me
weep
why
now
thou
hast
thy
will
for
raging
wind
blows
up
incessant
showers
and
when
the
rage
allays
the
rain
begins
these
tears
are
my
sweet
rutlands
obsequies
and
every
drop
cries
vengeance
for
his
death
gainst
thee
fell
clifford
and
thee
false
frenchwoman
beshrew
me
but
his
passion
moves
me
so
that
hardly
can
i
check
my
eyes
from
tears
that
face
of
his
the
hungry
cannibals
would
not
have
touchd
would
not
have
staind
with
blood
but
you
are
more
inhuman
more
inexorable
o
ten
times
more
than
tigers
of
hyrcania
see
ruthless
queen
a
hapless
fathers
tears
this
cloth
thou
dippdst
in
blood
of
my
sweet
boy
and
i
with
tears
do
wash
the
blood
away
keep
thou
the
napkin
and
go
boast
of
this
and
if
thou
tellst
the
heavy
story
right
upon
my
soul
the
hearers
will
shed
tears
yea
even
my
foes
will
shed
fastfalling
tears
and
say
alas
it
was
a
piteous
deed
there
take
the
crown
and
with
the
crown
my
curse
and
in
thy
need
such
comfort
come
to
thee
as
now
i
reap
at
thy
too
cruel
hand
hardhearted
clifford
take
me
from
the
world
my
soul
to
heaven
my
blood
upon
your
heads
had
he
been
slaughterman
to
all
my
kin
i
should
not
for
my
life
but
weep
with
him
to
see
how
inly
sorrow
gripes
his
soul
what
weepingripe
my
lord
northumberland
think
but
upon
the
wrong
he
did
us
all
and
that
will
quickly
dry
thy
melting
tears
heres
for
my
oath
heres
for
my
fathers
death
and
heres
to
right
our
gentlehearted
king
open
thy
gate
of
mercy
gracious
god
my
soul
flies
through
these
wounds
to
seek
out
thee
off
with
his
head
and
set
it
on
york
gates
so
york
may
overlook
the
town
of
york
i
wonder
how
our
princely
father
scapd
or
whether
he
be
scapd
away
or
no
from
cliffords
and
northumberlands
pursuit
had
he
been
taen
we
should
have
heard
the
news
had
he
been
slain
we
should
have
heard
the
news
or
had
he
scapd
methinks
we
should
have
heard
the
happy
tidings
of
his
good
escape
how
fares
my
brother
why
is
he
so
sad
i
cannot
joy
until
i
be
resolvd
where
our
right
valiant
father
is
become
i
saw
him
in
the
battle
range
about
and
watchd
him
how
he
singled
clifford
forth
methought
he
bore
him
in
the
thickest
troop
as
doth
a
lion
in
a
herd
of
neat
or
as
a
bear
encompassd
round
with
dogs
who
having
pinchd
a
few
and
made
them
cry
the
rest
stand
all
aloof
and
bark
at
him
so
fard
our
father
with
his
enemies
so
fled
his
enemies
my
warlike
father
methinks
tis
prize
enough
to
be
his
son
see
how
the
morning
opes
her
golden
gates
and
takes
her
farewell
of
the
glorious
sun
how
well
resembles
it
the
prime
of
youth
trimmd
like
a
younker
prancing
to
his
love
dazzle
mine
eyes
or
do
i
see
three
suns
three
glorious
suns
each
one
a
perfect
sun
not
separated
with
the
racking
clouds
but
severd
in
a
pale
clearshining
sky
see
see
they
join
embrace
and
seem
to
kiss
as
if
they
vowd
some
league
inviolable
now
are
they
but
one
lamp
one
light
one
sun
in
this
the
heaven
figures
some
event
tis
wondrous
strange
the
like
yet
never
heard
of
i
think
it
cites
us
brother
to
the
field
that
we
the
sons
of
brave
plantagenet
each
one
already
blazing
by
our
meeds
should
notwithstanding
join
our
lights
together
and
overshine
the
earth
as
this
the
world
whateer
it
bodes
henceforward
will
i
bear
upon
my
target
three
fairshining
suns
nay
bear
three
daughters
by
your
leave
i
speak
it
you
love
the
breeder
better
than
the
male
but
what
art
thou
whose
heavy
looks
foretell
some
dreadful
story
hanging
on
thy
tongue
ah
one
that
was
a
woeful
lookeron
when
as
the
noble
duke
of
york
was
slain
your
princely
father
and
my
loving
lord
o
speak
no
more
for
i
have
heard
too
much
say
how
he
died
for
i
will
hear
it
all
environed
he
was
with
many
foes
and
stood
against
them
as
the
hope
of
troy
against
the
greeks
that
would
have
enterd
troy
but
hercules
himself
must
yield
to
odds
and
many
strokes
though
with
a
little
axe
hew
down
and
fell
the
hardesttimberd
oak
by
many
hands
your
father
was
subdud
but
only
slaughterd
by
the
ireful
arm
of
unrelenting
clifford
and
the
queen
who
crownd
the
gracious
duke
in
high
despite
laughd
in
his
face
and
when
with
grief
he
wept
the
ruthless
queen
gave
him
to
dry
his
cheeks
a
napkin
steeped
in
the
harmless
blood
of
sweet
young
rutland
by
rough
clifford
slain
and
after
many
scorns
many
foul
taunts
they
took
his
head
and
on
the
gates
of
york
they
set
the
same
and
there
it
doth
remain
the
saddest
spectacle
that
eer
i
viewd
sweet
duke
of
york
our
prop
to
lean
upon
now
thou
art
gone
we
have
no
staff
no
stay
o
clifford
boistrous
clifford
thou
hast
slain
the
flower
of
europe
for
his
chivalry
and
treacherously
hast
thou
vanquishd
him
for
hand
to
hand
he
would
have
vanquishd
thee
now
my
souls
palace
is
become
a
prison
ah
would
she
break
from
hence
that
this
my
body
might
in
the
ground
be
closed
up
in
rest
for
never
henceforth
shall
i
joy
again
never
o
never
shall
i
see
more
joy
i
cannot
weep
for
all
my
bodys
moisture
scarce
serves
to
quench
my
furnaceburning
heart
nor
can
my
tongue
unload
my
hearts
great
burden
for
selfsame
wind
that
i
should
speak
withal
is
kindling
coals
that
fire
all
my
breast
and
burn
me
up
with
flames
that
tears
would
quench
to
weep
is
to
make
less
the
depth
of
grief
tears
then
for
babes
blows
and
revenge
for
me
richard
i
bear
thy
name
ill
venge
thy
death
or
die
renowned
by
attempting
it
his
name
that
valiant
duke
hath
left
with
thee
his
dukedom
and
his

how
now
fair
lords
what
fare
what
news
abroad
great
lord
of
warwick
if
we
should
recount
our
baleful
news
and
at
each
words
delivrance
stab
poniards
in
our
flesh
till
all
were
told
the
words
would
add
more
anguish
than
the
wounds
o
valiant
lord
the
duke
of
york
is
slain
o
warwick
warwick
that
plantagenet
which
held
thee
dearly
as
his
souls
redemption
is
by
the
stern
lord
clifford
done
to
death
ten
days
ago
i
drownd
these
news
in
tears
and
now
to
add
more
measure
to
your
woes
i
come
to
tell
you
things
sith
then
befallen
after
the
bloody
fray
at
wakefield
fought
where
your
brave
father
breathd
his
latest
gasp
tidings
as
swiftly
as
the
posts
could
run
were
brought
me
of
your
loss
and
his
depart
i
then
in
london
keeper
of
the
king
musterd
my
soldiers
gatherd
flocks
of
friends
and
very
well
appointed
as
i
thought
marchd
towards
saint
albans
to
intercept
the
queen
bearing
the
king
in
my
behalf
along
for
by
my
scouts
i
was
advertised
that
she
was
coming
with
a
full
intent
to
dash
our
late
decree
in
parliament
touching
king
henrys
oath
and
your
succession
short
tale
to
make
we
at
saint
albans
met
our
battles
joind
and
both
sides
fiercely
fought
but
whether
twas
the
coldness
of
the
king
who
lookd
full
gently
on
his
warlike
queen
that
robbd
my
soldiers
of
their
heated
spleen
or
whether
twas
report
of
her
success
or
more
than
common
fear
of
cliffords
rigour
who
thunders
to
his
captives
blood
and
death
i
cannot
judge
but
to
conclude
with
truth
their
weapons
like
to
lightning
came
and
went
our
soldiers
like
the
nightowls
lazy
flight
or
like
a
lazy
thresher
with
a
flail
fell
gently
down
as
if
they
struck
their
friends
i
cheerd
them
up
with
justice
of
our
cause
with
promise
of
high
pay
and
great
rewards
but
all
in
vain
they
had
no
heart
to
fight
and
we
in
them
no
hope
to
win
the
day
so
that
we
fled
the
king
unto
the
queen
lord
george
your
brother
norfolk
and
myself
in
haste
posthaste
are
come
to
join
with
you
for
in
the
marches
here
we
heard
you
were
making
another
head
to
fight
again
where
is
the
duke
of
norfolk
gentle
warwick
and
when
came
george
from
burgundy
to
england
some
six
miles
off

duke

with
the
soldiers
and
for
your
brother

was
lately

from
your
kind

aid
of
soldiers

this
needful
war

odds

when
valiant
warwick

i
heard
his
praises
in
pursuit
but
neer
till
now

scandal

hear
for
thou
shalt
know
this
strong
right
hand
of
mine
can
pluck
the
diadem
from
faint
henrys
head
and
wring
the
awful
sceptre
from
his
fist

away
our
coats
of
steel
and
wrap
our
bodies
in
black
mourning
gowns
numbring
our
avemaries
with
our
beads
or
shall
we
on
the
helmets
of
our
foes
tell
our
devotion
with
revengeful
arms
if
for
the
last
say
ay
and
to

lords
why
therefore

the
proud
insulting
queen
with
clifford
and
the
haught
northumberland
and
of
their
feather

more
proud
birds
have
wrought
the
easymelting
king
like
wax
he
swore
consent
to
your
succession
his
oath
enrolled
in
the
parliament
and
now
to
london
all
the
crew
are
gone
to
frustrate
both
his
oath
and
what
beside
may
make
against
the
house
of
lancaster
their
power
i
think
is
thirty
thousand
strong
now
if
the
help
of
norfolk
and
myself
with
all
the
friends
that
thou
brave
earl
of
march
amongst
the
loving
welshmen
canst
procure
will
but
amount
to
five
and
twenty
thousand
why
via
to
london
will
we
march
amain
and
once
again
bestride

for
well
i
wot
thou
hast
thy
mothers
tongue
but
thou
art
neither
like

but
like
a
foul
misshapen
stigmatic
markd
by
the
destinies
to
be
avoided
as
venom
toads
or
lizards
dreadful
stings
iron
of
naples
hid
with

bears
the

of
a
king
as

be
calld
the
sea
shamst
thou
not
knowing
whence
thou
art
extraught
to
let
thy
tongue
detect
thy
baseborn
heart
a
wisp
of
straw
were
worth
a
thousand
crowns
to
make
this
shameless
callet
know
herself
helen
of
greece
was
fairer
far
than
thou
although
thy
husband
may
be
menelaus
and
neer
was
agamemnons
brother
wrongd
by
that
false
woman
as
this
king
by
thee
his
father
revelld
in
the
heart
of
france
and
tamd
the
king
and
made
the
dauphin
stoop
and
had
he
matchd
according
to
his
state
he
might
have
kept
that
glory
to
this
day
but
when
he
took
a
beggar
to
his
bed
and
gracd
thy
poor
sire
with
his
bridal
day
even
then
that
sunshine
brewd
a
shower
for
him
that
washd
his
fathers
fortunes
forth
of
france
and
heapd
sedition
on
his
crown
at
home
for
what
hath
broachd
this
tumult
but
thy
pride
hadst
thou
been
meek
our
title
still
had
slept
and
we
in
pity
of
the
gentle
king
had
slippd
our
claim
until
another
age
but
when
we
saw
our
sunshine
made
thy
spring
and
that
thy
summer
bred
us
no
increase
we
set
the
axe
to
thy
usurping
root
and
though
the
edge
hath
something
hit
ourselves
yet
know
thou
since
we
have
begun
to
strike
well
never
leave
till
we
have
hewn
thee
down
or
bathd
thy
growing
with
our
heated
bloods
and
in
this
resolution
i
defy
thee
not
willing
any
longer
conference
since
thou
denyst
the
gentle
king
to
speak
sound
trumpets
let
our
bloody
colours
wave
and
either
victory
or
else
a
grave
stay
edward
no
wrangling
woman
well
no
longer
stay
these
words
will
cost
ten
thousand
lives
this
day
forspent
with
toil
as
runners
with
a
race
i
lay
me
down
a
little
while
to
breathe
for
strokes
receivd
and
many
blows
repaid
have
robbd
my
strongknit
sinews
of
their
strength
and
spite
of
spite
needs
must
i
rest
a
while
smile
gentle
heaven
or
strike
ungentle
death
for
this
world
frowns
and
edwards
sun
is
clouded
how
now
my
lord
what
hap
what
hope
of
good
our
hap
is
loss
our
hope
but
sad
despair
our
ranks
are
broke
and
ruin
follows
us
what
counsel
give
you
whither
shall
we
fly
bootless
is
flight
they
follow
us
with
wings
and
weak
we
are
and
cannot
shun
pursuit
ah
warwick
why
hast
thou
withdrawn
thyself
thy
brothers
blood
the
thirsty
earth
hath
drunk
broachd
with
the
steely
point
of
cliffords
lance
and
in
the
very
pangs
of
death
he
cried
like
to
a
dismal
clangor
heard
from
far
warwick
revenge
brother
revenge
my
death
so
underneath
the
belly
of
their
steeds
that
staind
their
fetlocks
in
his
smoking
blood
the
noble
gentleman
gave
up
the
ghost
then
let
the
earth
be
drunken
with
our
blood
ill
kill
my
horse
because
i
will
not
fly
why
stand
we
like
softhearted
women
here
wailing
our
losses
whiles
the
foe
doth
rage
and
look
upon
as
if
the
tragedy
were
playd
in
jest
by
counterfeiting
actors
here
on
my
knee
i
vow
to
god
above
ill
never
pause
again
never
stand
still
till
either
death
hath
closd
these
eyes
of
mine
of
fortune
given
me
measure
of
revenge
o
warwick
i
do
bend
my
knee
with
thine
and
in
this
vow
do
chain
my
soul
to
thine
and
ere
my
knee
rise
from
the
earths
cold
face
i
throw
my
hands
mine
eyes
my
heart
to
thee
thou
setter
up
and
plucker
down
of
kings
beseeching
thee
if
with
thy
will
it
stands
that
to
my
foes
this
body
must
be
prey
yet
that
thy
brazen
gates
of
heaven
may
ope
and
give
sweet
passage
to
my
sinful
soul
now
lords
take
leave
until
we
meet
again
whereer
it
be
in
heaven
or
in
earth
brother
give
me
thy
hand
and
gentle
warwick
let
me
embrace
thee
in
my
weary
arms
i
that
did
never
weep
now
melt
with
woe
that
winter
should
cut
off
our
springtime
so
away
away
once
more
sweet
lords
farewell
yet
let
us
all
together
to
our
troops
and
give
them
leave
to
fly
that
will
not
stay
and
call
them
pillars
that
will
stand
to
us
and
if
we
thrive
promise
them
such
rewards
as
victors
wear
at
the
olympian
games
this
may
plant
courage
in
their
quailing
breasts
for
yet
is
hope
of
life
and
victory
forslow
no
longer
make
we
hence
amain
now
clifford
i
have
singled
thee
alone
suppose
this
arm
is
for
the
duke
of
york
and
this
for
rutland
both
bound
to
revenge
wert
thou
environd
with
a
brazen
wall
now
richard
i
am
with
thee
here
alone
this
is
the
hand
that
stabbd
thy
father
york
and
this
the
hand
that
slew
thy
brother
rutland
and
heres
the
heart
that
triumphs
in
their
death
and
cheers
these
hands
that
slew
thy
sire
and
brother
to
execute
the
like
upon
thyself
and
so
have
at
thee
nay
warwick
single
out
some
other
chase
for
i
myself
will
hunt
this
wolf
to
death
this
battle
fares
like
to
the
mornings
war
when
dying
clouds
contend
with
growing
light
what
time
the
shepherd
blowing
of
his
nails
can
neither
call
it
perfect
day
nor
night
now
sways
it
this
way
like
a
mighty
sea
forcd
by
the
tide
to
combat
with
the
wind
now
sways
it
that
way
like
the
selfsame
sea
forcd
to
retire
by
fury
of
the
wind
sometime
the
flood
prevails
and
then
the
wind
now
one
the
better
then
another
best
both
tugging
to
be
victors
breast
to
breast
yet
neither
conqueror
nor
conquered
so
is
the
equal
poise
of
this
fell
war
here
on
this
molehill
will
i
sit
me
down
to
whom
god
will
there
be
the
victory
for
margaret
my
queen
and
clifford
too
have
chid
me
from
the
battle
swearing
both
they
prosper
best
of
all
when
i
am
thence
would
i
were
dead
if
gods
good
will
were
so
for
what
is
in
this
world
but
grief
and
woe
o
god
methinks
it
were
a
happy
life
to
be
no
better
than
a
homely
swain
to
sit
upon
a
hill
as
i
do
now
to
carve
out
dials
quaintly
point
by
point
thereby
to
see
the
minutes
how
they
run
how
many
make
the
hour
full
complete
how
many
hours
bring
about
the
day
how
many
days
will
finish
up
the
year
how
many
years
a
mortal
man
may
live
when
this
is
known
then
to
divide
the
times
so
many
hours
must
i
tend
my
flock
so
many
hours
must
i
take
my
rest
so
many
hours
must
i
contemplate
so
many
hours
must
i
sport
myself
so
many
days
my
ewes
have
been
with
young
so
many
weeks
ere
the
poor
fools
will
ean
so
many
years
ere
i
shall
shear
the
fleece
so
minutes
hours
days
months
and
years
passd
over
to
the
end
they
were
created
would
bring
white
hairs
unto
a
quiet
grave
ah
what
a
life
were
this
how
sweet
how
lovely
gives
not
the
hawthorn
bush
a
sweeter
shade
to
shepherds
looking
on
their
silly
sheep
than
doth
a
rich
embroiderd
canopy
to
kings
that
fear
their
subjects
treachery
o
yes
it
doth
a
thousandfold
it
doth
and
to
conclude
the
shepherds
homely
curds
his
cold
thin
drink
out
of
his
leather
bottle
his
wonted
sleep
under
a
fresh
trees
shade
all
which
secure
and
sweetly
he
enjoys
is
far
beyond
a
princes
delicates
his
viands
sparkling
in
a
golden
cup
his
body
couched
in
a
curious
bed
when
care
mistrust
and
treason
wait
on
him
ill
blows
the
wind
that
profits
nobody
this
man
whom
hand
to
hand
i
slew
in
fight
may
be
possessed
with
some
store
of
crowns
and
i
that
haply
take
them
from
him
now
may
yet
ere
night
yield
both
my
life
and
them
to
some
man
else
as
this
dead
man

poor
harmless

wretched

with
grief

that
so
stoutly

thy
gold
if
thou
hast
any
gold
for

too
soon
and
hath
bereft
thee
of
thy
life
too
late
woe
above

grief
more
than

grief
o
that
my

stay
these
ruthful
deeds
o

rose
and
the

the
fatal
colours
of
our
striving

blood
right
well
resembles
the
other

pale
cheeks
methinks
presenteth
wither
one
rose
and
let
the
other
flourish
if
you
contend
a
thousand
lives
must
wither
how
will
my
mother
for
a
fathers
death
take
on
with
me
and
neer
be
satisfied
how
will
my
wife
for
slaughter
of
my
son
shed
seas
of
tears
and

i
have

no

the

we
lords
good
fortune
bids
us
pause
and
smooth
the
frowns
of
war
with
peaceful
looks
some
troops
pursue
the
bloodyminded
queen
that
led
calm
henry
though
he
were
a
king
as
doth
a
sail
filld
with
a
fretting
gust
command
an
argosy
to
stern
the
waves
but
think
you
lords
that
clifford
fled
with
them
no
tis
impossible
he
should
escape
for
though
before
his
face
i
speak
the
words
your
brother
richard
markd
him
for
the
grave
and
wheresoeer
he
is
hes
surely
dead
whose
soul
is
that
which
takes
her
heavy
leave
a
deadly
groan
like
life
and
deaths
departing
see
who
it
is
and
now
the
battles
ended
if
friend
or
foe
let
him
be
gently
usd
revoke
that
doom
of
mercy
for
tis
clifford
who
not
contented
that
he
loppd
the
branch
in
hewing
rutland
when
his
leaves
put
forth
but
set
his
murdring
knife
unto
the
root
from
whence
that
tender
spray
did
sweetly
spring
i
mean
our
princely
father
duke
of
york
from
off
the
gates
of
york
fetch
down
the
head
your
fathers
head
which
clifford
placed
there
instead
whereof
let
this
supply
the
room
measure
for
measure
must
be
answered
bring
forth
that
fatal
screechowl
to
our
house
that
nothing
sung
but
death
to
us
and
ours
now
death
shall
stop
his
dismal
threatening
sound
and
his
illboding
tongue
no
more
shall
speak
i
think
his
understanding
is
bereft
speak
clifford
dost
thou
know
who
speaks
to
thee
dark
cloudy
death
oershades
his
beams
of
life
and
he
nor
sees
nor
hears
us
what
we
say
o
would
he
did
and
so
perhaps
he
doth
tis
but
his
policy
to
counterfeit
because
he
would
avoid
such
bitter
taunts
which
in
the
time
of
death
he
gave
our
father
if
so
thou
thinkst
vex
him
with
eager
words
clifford
ask
mercy
and
obtain
no
grace
clifford
repent
in
bootless
penitence
clifford
devise
excuses
for
thy
faults
while
we
devise
fell
tortures
for
thy
faults
thou
didst
love
york
and
i
am
son
to
york
thou
pitiedst
rutland
i
will
pity
thee
wheres
captain
margaret
to
fence
you
now
they
mock
thee
clifford
swear
as
thou
wast
wont
what
not
an
oath
nay
then
the
world
goes
hard
when
clifford
cannot
spare
his
friends
an
oath
i
know
by
that
hes
dead
and
by
my
soul
if
this
right
hand
would
buy
two
hours
life
that
i
in
all
despite
might
rail
at
him
this
hand
should
chop
it
off
and
with
the
issuing
blood
stifle
the
villain
whose
unstaunched
thirst
york
and
young
rutland
could
not
satisfy
ay
but
hes
dead
off
with
the
traitors
head
and
rear
it
in
the
place

fathers
stands

shalt
not
dread
the
scatterd
foe
that

for
edward
if
this
news
be
true
poor
queen
and
son
your
labour
is
but
lost
for
warwick
is
a
subtle
orator
and
lewis
a
prince
soon
won
with
moving
words
by
this
account
then
margaret
may
win
him
for
shes
a
woman
to
be
pitied
much
her
sighs
will
make
a
battery
in
his
breast
her
tears
will
pierce
into
a
marble
heart
the
tiger
will
be
mild
whiles
she
doth
mourn
and
nero
will
be
tainted
with
remorse
to
hear
and
see
her
plaints
her
brinish
tears
ay
but
shes
come
to
beg
warwick
to
give
she
on
his
left
side
craving
aid
for
henry
he
on
his
right
asking
a
wife
for
edward
she
weeps
and
says
her
henry
is
deposd
he
smiles
and
says
his
edward
is
installd
that
she
poor
wretch
for
grief
can
speak
no
more
whiles
warwick
tells
his
title
smooths
the
wrong
inferreth
arguments
of
mighty
strength
and
in
conclusion
wins
the
king
from
her
with
promise
of
his
sister
and
what
else
to
strengthen
and
support
king
edwards
place
o
margaret
thus
twill
be
and
thou
poor
soul
art
then
forsaken
as
thou
wentst
forlorn
say
what
art
thou
that
talkst
of
kings
and
queens
more
than
i
seem
and
less
than
i
was
born
to
a
man
at
least
for
less
i
should
not
be
and
men
may
talk
of
kings
and
why
not
i
ay
but
thou
talkst
as
if
thou
wert
a
king
why
so
i
am
in
mind
and
thats
enough
but
if
thou
be
a
king
where
is
thy
crown
my
crown
is
in
my
heart
not
on
my
head
not
deckd
with
diamonds
and
indian
stones
nor
to
be
seen
my
crown
is
calld
content
a
crown
it
is
that
seldom
kings
enjoy
well
if
you
be
a
king
crownd
with
content
your
crown
content
and
you
must
be
contented
to
go
along
with
us
for
as
we
think
you
are
the
king
king
edward
hath
deposd
and
we
his
subjects
sworn
in
all
allegiance
will
apprehend
you
as
his
enemy
but
did
you
never
swear
and
break
an
oath
no
never
such
an
oath
nor
will
not
now
where
did
you
dwell
when
i
was
king
of
england
here
in
this
country
where
we
now
remain
i
was
anointed
king
at
nine
months
old
my
father
and
my
grandfather
were
kings
and
you
were
sworn
true
subjects
unto
me
and
tell
me
then
have
you
not
broke
your
oaths
no
for
we
were
subjects
but
while
you
were
king
why
am
i
dead
do
i
not
breathe
a
man
ah
simple
men
you
know
not
what
you
swear
look
as
i
blow
this
feather
from
my
face
and
as
the
air
blows
it
to
me
again
obeying
with
my
wind
when
i
do
blow
and
yielding
to
another
when
it
blows
commanded
always
by
the
greater
gust
such
is
the
lightness
of
you
common
men
but
do
not
break
your
oaths
for
of
that
sin
my
mild
entreaty
shall
not
make
you
guilty
go
where
you
will
the
king
shall
be
commanded
and
be
you
kings

and
ill
obey
we
are
true

as
dearly
as

love
myself
and
would
you
not
do
much
to
do
them
good
to
do
them
good
i
would
sustain
some
harm
then
get
your
husbands
lands
to
do
them
good
therefore
i
came
unto
your
majesty
ill
tell
you
how
these
lands
are
to
be
got
so
shall
you
bind
me
to
your
highness
service
what
service
wilt
thou
do
me
if
i
give
them
what
you
command
that
rests
in
me
to
do
but
you
will
take
exceptions
to
my
boon
no
gracious
lord
except
i
cannot
do
it
ay
but
thou
canst
do
what
i
mean
to
ask
why
then
i
will
do
what
your
grace
commands
he
plies
her
hard
and
much
rain
wears
the
marble
as
red
as
fire
nay
then
her
wax
must
melt
why
stops
my
lord
shall
i
not
hear
my
task
an
easy
task
tis
but
to
love
a
king
thats
soon
performd
because
i
am
a
subject
why
then
thy
husbands
lands
i
freely
give
thee
i
take
my
leave
with
many
thousand
thanks
the
match
is
made
she
seals
it
with
a
curtsy
but
stay
thee
tis
the
fruits
of
love
i
mean
the
fruits
of
love
i
mean
my
loving
liege
ay
but
i
fear
me
in
another
sense
what
love
thinkst
thou
i
sue
so
much
to
get
my
love
till
death
my
humble
thanks
my
prayers
that
love
which
virtue
begs
and
virtue
grants
no
by
my
troth
i
did
not
mean
such
love
why
then
you
mean
not
as
i
thought
you
did
but
now
you
partly
may
perceive
my
mind
my
mind
will
never
grant
what
i
perceive
your
highness
aims
at
if
i
aim
aright
to
tell
thee
plain
i
aim
to
lie
with
thee
to
tell
you
plain
i
had
rather
lie
in
prison
why
then
thou
shalt
not
have
thy
husbands
lands
why
then
mine
honesty
shall
be
my
dower
for
by
that
loss
i
will
not
purchase
them
therein
thou
wrongst
thy
children
mightily
herein
your
highness
wrongs
both
them
and
me
but
mighty
lord
this
merry
inclination
accords
not
with
the
sadness
of
my
suit
please
you
dismiss
me
either
with
ay
or
no
ay
if
thou
wilt
say
ay
to
my
request
no
if
thou
dost
say
no
to
my
demand
then
no
my
lord
my
suit
is
at
an
end
the
widow
likes
him
not
she
knits
her
brows
he
is
the
bluntest
wooer
in
christendom
her
looks
do
argue
her
replete
with
modesty
her
words
do
show
her
wit
incomparable
all
her
perfections
challenge
sovereignty
one
way
or
other
she
is
for
a
king
and
she
shall
be
my
love
or
else
my
queen
say
that
king
edward
take
thee
for
his
queen
tis
better
said
than
done
my
gracious
lord
i
am
a
subject
fit
to
jest
withal
but
far
unfit
to
be
a
sovereign
sweet
widow
by
my
state
i
swear
to
thee
i
speak
no
more
than
what
my
soul
intends
and
that
is
to
enjoy
thee
for
my
love
and
that
is
more
than
i
will
yield
unto
i
know
i
am
too
mean
to
be
your
queen
and
yet
too
good
to
be
your
concubine
you
cavil
widow
i
did
mean
my
queen
twill
grieve
your
grace
my
sons
should
call
you
father
no
more
than
when
my
daughters
call
thee
mother
thou
art
a
widow
and
thou
hast
some
children
and
by
gods
mother
i
being
but
a
bachelor
have
other
some
why
tis
a
happy
thing
to
be
the
father
unto
many
sons
answer
no
more
for
thou
shalt
be
my
queen
the
ghostly
father
now
hath
done
his
shrift
when
he
was
made
a
shriver
twas
for
shift
brothers
you
muse
what
chat
we
two
have
had
the
widow
likes
it
not
for
she
looks
very
sad
youd
think
it
strange
if
i
should
marry
her
to
whom
my
lord
why
clarence
to
myself
that
would
be
ten
days
wonder
at
the
least
thats
a
day
longer
than
a
wonder
lasts
by
so
much
is
the
wonder
in
extremes
well
jest
on
brothers
i
can
tell
you
both
her
suit
is
granted
for
her
husbands
lands
my
gracious
lord
henry
your
foe
is
taken
and
brought
as
prisoner
to
your
palace
gate
see
that
he
be
conveyd
unto
the
tower
and
go
we
brothers
to
the
man
that
took
him
to
question
of
his
apprehension
widow
go
you
along
lords
use
her
honourably
ay
edward
will
use
women
honourably
would
he
were
wasted
marrow
bones
and
all
that
from
his
loins
no
hopeful
branch
may
spring
to
cross
me
from
the
golden
time
i
look
for
and
yet
between
my
souls
desire
and
me
the
lustful
edwards
title
buried
is
clarence
henry
and
his
son
young
edward
and
all
the
unlookd
for
issue
of
their
bodies
to
take
their
rooms
ere
i
can
place
myself
a
cold
premeditation
for
my
purpose
why
then
i
do
but
dream
on
sovereignty
like
one
that
stands
upon
a
promontory
and
spies
a
faroff
shore
where
he
would
tread
wishing
his
foot
were
equal
with
his
eye
and
chides
the
sea
that
sunders
him
from
thence
saying
hell
lade
it
dry
to
have
his
way
so
do
i
wish
the
crown
being
so
far
off
and
so
i
chide
the
means
that
keep
me
from
it
and
so
i
say
ill
cut
the
causes
off
flattering
me
with
impossibilities
my
eyes
too
quick
my
heart
oerweens
too
much
unless
my
hand
and
strength
could
equal
them
well
say
there
is
no
kingdom
then
for
richard
what
other
pleasure
can
the
world
afford
ill
make
my
heaven
in
a
ladys
lap
and
deck
my
body
in
gay
ornaments
and
witch
sweet
ladies
with
my
words
and
looks
o
miserable
thought
and
more
unlikely
than
to
accomplish
twenty
golden
crowns
why
love
forswore
me
in
my
mothers
womb
and
for
i
should
not
deal
in
her
soft
laws
she
did
corrupt
frail
nature
with
some
bribe
to
shrink
mine
arm
up
like
a
witherd
shrub
to
make
an
envious
mountain
on
my
back
where
sits
deformity
to
mock
my
body
to
shape
my
legs
of
an
unequal
size
to
disproportion
me
in
every
part
like
to
a
chaos
or
an
unlickd
bearwhelp
that
carries
no
impression
like
the
dam
and
am
i
then
a
man
to
be
belovd
o
monstrous
fault
to
harbour
such
a
thought
then
since
this
earth
affords
no
joy
to
me
but
to
command
to
check
to
oerbear
such
as
are
of
better
person
than
myself
ill
make
my
heaven
to
dream
upon
the
crown
and
whiles
i
live
to
account
this
world
but
hell
until
my
misshapd
trunk
that
bears
this
head
be
round
impaled
with
a
glorious
crown
and
yet
i
know
not
how
to
get
the
crown
for
many
lives
stand
between
me
and
home
and
i
like
one
lost
in
a
thorny
wood
that
rents
the
thorns
and
is
rent
with
the
thorns
seeking
a
way
and
straying
from
the
way
not
knowing
how
to
find
the
open
air
but
toiling
desperately
to
find
it
out
torment
myself
to
catch
the
english
crown
and
from
that
torment
i
will
free
myself
or
hew
my
way
out
with
a
bloody
axe
why
i
can
smile
and
murder
while
i
smile
and
cry
content
to
that
which
grieves
my
heart
and
wet
my
cheeks
with
artificial
tears
and
frame
my
face
to
all
occasions
ill
drown
more
sailors
than
the
mermaid
shall
ill
slay
more
gazers
than
the
basilisk
ill
play
the
orator
as
well
as
nestor
deceive
more
slily
than
ulysses
could
and
like
a
sinon
take
another
troy
i
can
add
colours
to
the
chameleon
change
shapes
with
proteus
for
advantages
and
set
the
murdrous
machiavel
to
school
can
i
do
this
and
cannot
get
a
crown
tut
were
it
further
off
ill
pluck
it
down
fair
queen
of
england
worthy
margaret
sit
down
with
us
it
ill
befits
thy
state
and
birth
that
thou
shouldst
stand
while
lewis
doth
sit
no
mighty
king
of
france
now
margaret
must
strike
her
sail
and
learn
a
while
to
serve
where
kings
command
i
was
i
must
confess
great
albions
queen
in
former
golden
days
but
now
mischance
hath
trod
my
title
down
and
with
dishonour
laid
me
on
the
ground
where
i
must
take
like
seat
unto
my
fortune
and
to
my
humble
seat
conform
myself
why
say
fair
queen
whence
springs
this
deep
despair
from
such
a
cause
as
fills
mine
eyes
with
tears
and
stops
my
tongue
while
heart
is
drownd
in
cares
whateer
it
be
be
thou
still
like
thyself
and
sit
thee
by
our
side
yield
not
thy
neck
to
fortunes
yoke
but
let
thy
dauntless
mind
still
ride
in
triumph
over
all
mischance
be
plain
queen
margaret
and
tell
thy
grief
it
shall
be
easd
if
france
can
yield
relief
those
gracious
words
revive
my
drooping
thoughts
and
give
my
tonguetied
sorrows
leave
to
speak
now
therefore
be
it
known
to
noble
lewis
that
henry
sole
possessor
of
my
love
is
of
a
king
become
a
banishd
man
and
forcd
to
live
in
scotland
a
forlorn
while
proud
ambitious
edward
duke
of
york
usurps
the
regal
title
and
the
seat
of
englands
trueanointed
lawful
king
this
is
the
cause
that
i
poor
margaret
with
this
my
son
prince
edward
henrys
heir
am
come
to
crave
thy
just
and
lawful
aid
and
if
thou
fail
us
all
our
hope
is
done
scotland
hath
will
to
help
but
cannot
help
our
people
and
our
peers
are
both
misled
our
treasure
seizd
our
soldiers
put
to
flight
and
as
thou
seest
ourselves
in
heavy
plight
renowned
queen
with
patience
calm
the
storm
while
we
bethink
a
means
to
break
it
off
the
more
we
stay
the
stronger
grows
our
foe
the
more
i
stay
the
more
ill
succour
thee
o
but
impatience
waiteth
on
true
sorrow
and
see
where
comes
the
breeder
of
my
sorrow
whats
he
approacheth
boldly
to
our
presence
our
earl
of
warwick
edwards
greatest
friend
welcome
brave
warwick
what
brings
thee
to
france
ay
now
begins
a
second
storm
to
rise
for
this
is
he
that
moves
both
wind
and
tide
from
worthy
edward
king
of
albion
my
lord
and
sovereign
and
thy
vowed
friend
i
come
in
kindness
and
unfeigned
love
first
to
do
greetings
to
thy
royal
person
and
then
to
crave
a
league
of
amity
and
lastly
to
confirm
that
amity
with
nuptial
knot
if
thou
vouchsafe
to
grant
that
virtuous
lady
bona
thy
fair
sister
to
englands
king
in
lawful
marriage
if
that
go
forward
henrys
hope
is
done
and
gracious
madam
in
our
kings
behalf
i
am
commanded
with
your
leave
and
favour
humbly
to
kiss
your
hand
and
with
my
tongue
to
tell
the
passion
of
my
sovreigns
heart
where
fame
late
entering
at
his
heedful
ears
hath
placd
thy
beautys
image
and
thy
virtue
king
lewis
and
lady
bona
hear
me
speak
before
you
answer
warwick
his
demand
springs
not
from
edwards
wellmeant
honest
love
but
from
deceit
bred
by
necessity
for
how
can
tyrants
safely
govern
home
unless
abroad
they
purchase
great
alliance
to
prove
him
tyrant
this
reason
may
suffice
that
henry
liveth
still
but
were
he
dead
yet
here
prince
edward
stands
king
henrys
son
look
therefore
lewis
that
by
this
league
and
marriage
thou
draw
not
on
thy
danger
and
dishonour
for
though
usurpers
sway
the
rule
awhile
yet
heavens
are
just
and
time
suppresseth
wrongs
injurious
margaret
and
why
not
queen
because
thy
father
henry
did
usurp
and
thou
no
more
art
prince
than
she
is
queen
then
warwick
disannuls
great
john
of
gaunt
which
did
subdue
the
greatest
part
of
spain
and
after
john
of
gaunt
henry
the
fourth
whose
wisdom
was
a
mirror
to
the
wisest
and
after
that
wise
prince
henry
the
fifth
who
by
his
prowess
conquered
all
france
from
these
our
henry
lineally
descends
oxford
how
haps
it
in
this
smooth
discourse
you
told
not
how
henry
the
sixth
hath
lost
all
that
which
henry
the
fifth
had
gotten
methinks
these
peers
of
france
should
smile
at
that
but
for
the
rest
you
tell
a
pedigree
of
threescore
and
two
years
a
silly
time
to
make
prescription
for
a
kingdoms
worth
why
warwick
canst
thou
speak
against
thy
liege
whom
thou
obeyedst
thirty
and
six
years
and
not
bewray
thy
treason
with
a
blush
can
oxford
that
did
ever
fence
the
right
now
buckler
falsehood
with
a
pedigree
for
shame
leave
henry
and
call
edward
king
call
him
my
king
by
whose
injurious
doom
my
elder
brother
the
lord
aubrey
vere
was
done
to
death
and
more
than
so
my
father
even
in
the
downfall
of
his
mellowd
years
when
nature
brought
him
to
the
door
of
death
no
warwick
no
while
life
upholds
this
arm
this
arm
upholds
the
house
of
lancaster
and
i
the
house
of
york
queen
margaret
prince
edward
and
oxford
vouchsafe
at
our
request
to
stand
aside
while
i
use
further
conference
with
warwick
heaven
grant
that
warwicks
words
bewitch
him
not
now
warwick
tell
me
even
upon
thy
conscience
is
edward
your
true
king
for
i
were
loath
to
link
with
him
that
were
not
lawful
chosen
thereon
i
pawn
my
credit
and
mine
honour
but
is
he
gracious
in
the
peoples
eye
the
more
that
henry
was
unfortunate
then
further
all
dissembling
set
aside
tell
me
for
truth
the
measure
of
his
love
unto
our
sister
bona
such
it
seems
as
may
beseem
a
monarch
like
himself
myself
have
often
heard
him
say
and
swear
that
this
his
love
was
an
eternal
plant
whereof
the
root
was
fixd
in
virtues
ground
the
leaves
and
fruit
maintaind
with
beautys
sun
exempt
from
envy
but
not
from
disdain
unless
the
lady
bona
quit
his
pain
now
sister
let
us
hear
your
firm
resolve
your
grant
or
your
denial
shall
be
mine
yet
i
confess
that
often
ere
this
day
when
i
have
heard
your
kings
desert
recounted
mine
ear
hath
tempted
judgment
to
desire
then
warwick
thus
our
sister
shall
be
edwards
and
now
forthwith
shall
articles
be
drawn
touching
the
jointure
that
your
king
must
make
which
with
her
dowry
shall
be
counterpoisd
draw
near
queen
margaret
and
be
a
witness
that
bona
shall
be
wife
to
the
english
king
to
edward
but
not
to
the
english
king
deceitful
warwick
it
was
thy
device
by
this
alliance
to
make
void
my
suit
before
thy
coming
lewis
was
henrys
friend
and
still
is
friend
to
him
and
margaret
but
if
your
title
to
the
crown
be
weak
as
may
appear
by
edwards
good
success
then
tis
but
reason
that
i
be
releasd
from
giving
aid
which
late
i
promised
yet
shall
you
have
all
kindness
at
my
hand
that
your
estate
requires
and
mine
can
yield
henry
now
lives
in
scotland
at
his
ease
where
having
nothing
nothing
can
he
lose
and
as
for
you
yourself
our
quondam
queen
you
have
a
father
able
to
maintain
you
and
better
twere
you
troubled
him
than
france
peace
impudent
and
shameless
warwick
peace
proud
setter
up
and
puller
down
of
kings
i
will
not
hence
till
with
my
talk
and
tears
both
full
of
truth
i
make
king
lewis
behold
thy
sly
conveyance
and
thy
lords
false
love
for
both
of
you
are
birds
of
selfsame
feather

is
some
post
to
us
or
thee

lord

for
you

well
that

are
thy

him
and
as
for
clarence
as
my
letters
tell

hes
very
likely

to
fall

than
for
strength
and
safety
of
our

and
here
to
pledge
my
vow
i
give
my
hand
why

these
soldiers
shall
be
levied
and
thou
lord
bourbon
our
high
admiral
shall
waft
them
over
with
our
royal
fleet
i
long
till
edward
fall
by
wars
mischance
for
mocking
marriage
with
a
dame
of
france
i
came
from
edward
as
ambassador
but
i
return
his
sworn
and
mortal
foe
matter
of
marriage
was
the
charge
he
gave
me
but
dreadful
war
shall
answer
his
demand
had
he
none
else
to
make
a
stale
but
me
then
none
but
i
shall
turn
his
jest
to
sorrow
i
was
the
chief
that
raisd
him
to
the
crown
and
ill
be
chief
to
bring
him
down
again
not
that
i
pity
henrys
misery
but
seek
revenge
on
edwards
mockery
now
tell
me
brother
clarence
what
think
you
of
this
new
marriage
with
the
lady
grey
hath
not
our
brother
made
a
worthy
choice
alas
you
know
tis
far
from
hence
to
france
how
could
he
stay
till
warwick
made
return
my
lords
forbear
this
talk
here
comes
the
king
and
his
wellchosen
bride
i
mind
to
tell
him
plainly
what
i
think
now
brother
clarence
how
like
you
our
choice
that
you
stand
pensive
as
half
malcontent
as
well
as
lewis
of
france
or
the
earl
of
warwick
which
are
so
weak
of
courage
and
in
judgment
that
theyll
take
no
offence
at
our
abuse
suppose
they
take
offence
without
a
cause
they
are
but
lewis
and
warwick
i
am
edward
your
king
and
warwicks
and
must
have
my
will
and
you
shall
have
your
will
because
our
king
yet
hasty
marriage
seldom
proveth
well
yea
brother
richard
are
you
offended
too
not
i
no
god
forbid
that
i
should
wish
them
severd
whom
god
hath
joind
together
ay
and
twere
pity
to
sunder
them
that
yoke
so
well
together
setting
your
scorns
and
your
mislike
aside
tell
me
some
reason
why
the
lady
grey
should
not
become
my
wife
and
englands
queen
and
you
too
somerset
and
montague
speak
freely
what
you
think
then
this
is
mine
opinion
that
king
lewis
becomes
your
enemy
for
mocking
him
about
the
marriage
of
the
lady
bona
and
warwick
doing
what
you
gave
in
charge
is
now
dishonoured
by
this
new
marriage
what
if
both
lewis
and
warwick
be
appeasd
by
such
invention
as
i
can
devise
yet
to
have
joind
with
france
in
such
alliance
would
more
have
strengthend
this
our
commonwealth
gainst
foreign
storms
than
any
homebred
marriage
why
knows
not
montague
that
of
itself
england
is
safe
if
true
within
itself
yes
but
the
safer
when
tis
backd
with
france
tis
better
using
france
than
trusting
france
let
us
be
backd
with
god
and
with
the
seas
which
he
hath
given
for
fence
impregnable
and
with
their
helps
only
defend
ourselves
in
them
and
in
ourselves
our
safety
lies
for
this
one
speech
lord
hastings
well
deserves
to
have
the
heir
of
the
lord
hungerford
ay
what
of
that
it
was
my
will
and
grant
and
for
this
once
my
will
shall
stand
for
law
and
yet
methinks
your
grace
hath
not
done
well
to
give
the
heir
and
daughter
of
lord
scales
unto
the
brother
of
your
loving
bride
she
better
would
have
fitted
me
or
clarence
but
in
your
bride
you
bury
brotherhood
or
else
you
would
not
have
bestowd
the
heir
of
the
lord
bonville
on
your
new
wifes
son
and
leave
your
brothers
to
go
speed
elsewhere
alas
poor
clarence
is
it
for
a
wife
that
thou
art
malcontent
i
will
provide
thee
in
choosing
for
yourself
you
showd
your
judgment
which
being
shallow
you
shall
give
me
leave
to
play
the
broker
on
mine
own
behalf
and
to
that
end
i
shortly
mind
to
leave
you
leave
me
or
tarry
edward
will
be
king
and
not
be
tied
unto
his
brothers
will
my
lords
before
it
pleasd
his
majesty
to
raise
my
state
to
title
of
a
queen
do
me
but
right
and
you
must
allconfess
that
i
was
not
ignoble
of
descent
and
meaner
than
myself
have
had
like
fortune
but
as
this
title
honours
me
and
mine
so
your
dislikes
to
whom
i
would
be
pleasing
do
cloud
my
joys
with
danger
and
with
sorrow
my
love
forbear
to
fawn
upon
their
frowns
what
danger
or
what
sorrow
can
befall
thee
so
long
as
edward
is
thy
constant
friend
and
their
true
sovereign
whom
they
must
obey
nay
whom
they
shall
obey
and
love
thee
too
unless
they
seek
for
hatred
at
my
hands
which
if
they
do
yet
will
i
keep
thee
safe
and
they
shall
feel
the
vengeance
of
my
wrath
i
hear
yet
say
not
much
but
think
the
more
now
messenger
what
letters
or
what
news
from
france
my
sovereign
liege
no
letters
and
few
words
but
such
as
i
without
your
special
pardon
dare
not
relate
go
to
we
pardon
thee
therefore
in
brief
tell
me
their
words
as
near
as
thou
canst
guess
them
what
answer
makes
king
lewis
unto
our
letters
at
my
depart
these
were
his
very
words
go
tell
false
edward
thy
supposed
king
that
lewis
of
france
is
sending
over
masquers
to
revel
it
with
him
and
his
new
bride
is
lewis
so
brave
belike
he
thinks
me
henry
but
what
said
lady
bona
to
my
marriage
these
were
her
words
utterd
with
mild
disdain
tell
him
in
hope
hell
prove
a
widower
shortly
ill
wear
the
willow
garland
for
his
sake
i
blame
not
her
she
could
say
little
less
she
had
the
wrong
but
what
said
henrys
queen
for
i
have
heard
that
she
was
there
in
place
tell
him
quoth
she
my
mourning
weeds
are
done
and
i
am
ready
to
put
armour
on
belike
she
minds
to
play
the
amazon
but
what
said
warwick
to
these
injuries
he
more
incensd
against
your
majesty
than
all
the
rest
dischargd
me
with
these
words
tell
him
from
me
that
he
hath
done
me
wrong
and
therefore
ill
uncrown
him
eret
be
long
ha
durst
the
traitor
breathe
out
so
proud
words
well
i
will
arm
me
being
thus
forewarnd
they
shall
have
wars
and
pay
for
their
presumption
but
say
is
warwick
friends
with
margaret
ay
gracious
sovereign
they
are
so
linkd
in
friendship
that
young
prince
edward
marries
warwicks
daughter
belike
the
elder
clarence
will
have
the
younger
now
brother
king
farewell
and
sit
you
fast
for
i
will
hence
to
warwicks
other
daughter
that
though
i
want
a
kingdom
yet
in
marriage
i
may
not
prove
inferior
to
yourself
you
that
love
me
and
warwick
follow
me
not
i
my
thoughts
aim
at
a
further
matter
i
stay
not
for
love
of
edward
but
the
crown
clarence
and
somerset
both
gone
to
warwick
yet
am
i
armd
against
the
worst
can
happen
and
haste
is
needful
in
this
desperate
case
pembroke
and
stafford
you
in
our
behalf
go
levy
men
and
make
prepare
for
war
they
are
already
or
quickly
will
be
landed
myself
in
person
will
straight
follow
you
but
ere
i
go
hastings
and
montague
resolve
my
doubt
you
twain
of
all
the
rest
are
near
to
warwick
by
blood
and
by
alliance
tell
me
if
you
love
warwick
more
than
me
if
it
be
so
then
both
depart
to
him
i
rather
wish
you
foes
than
hollow
friends
but
if
you
mind
to
hold
your
true
obedience
give
me
assurance
with
some
friendly
vow
that
i
may
never
have
you
in
suspect
so
god
help
montague
as
he
proves
true
and
hastings
as
he
favours
edwards
cause
now
brother
richard
will
you
stand
by
us
ay
in
despite
of
all
that
shall
withstand
you
why
so
then
am
i
sure
of
victory
now
therefore
let
us
hence
and
lose
no
hour
till
we
meet
warwick
with
his
foreign
power
trust
me
my
lord
all
hitherto
goes
well
the
common
people
by
numbers
swarm
to
us
but
see
where
somerset
and
clarence
come
speak
suddenly
my
lords
are
we
all
friends
fear
not
that
my
lord
then
gentle
clarence
welcome
unto
warwick
and
welcome
somerset
i
hold
it
cowardice
to
rest
mistrustful
where
a
noble
heart
hath
pawnd
an
open
hand
in
sign
of
love
else
might
i
think
that
clarence
edwards
brother
were
but
a
feigned
friend
to
our
proceedings
but
welcome
sweet
clarence
my
daughter
shall
be
thine
and
now
what
rests
but
in
nights
coverture
thy
brother
being
carelessly
encampd
his
soldiers
lurking
in
the
towns
about
and
but
attended
by
a
simple
guard
we
may
surprise
and
take
him
at
our
pleasure
our
scouts
have
found
the
adventure
very
easy
that
as
ulysses
and
stout
diomede
with
sleight
and
manhood
stole
to
rhesus
tents
and
brought
from
thence
the
thracian
fatal
steeds
so
we
well
coverd
with
the
nights
black
mantle
at
unawares
may
beat
down
edwards
guard
and
seize
himself
i
say
not
slaughter
him
for
i
intend
but
only
to
surprise
him
you
that
will
follow
me
to
this
attempt
applaud
the
name
of
henry
with
your
leader
why
then
lets
on
our
way
in
silent
sort
for
warwick
and
his
friends
god
and
saint
george
come
on
my
masters
each
man
take
his
stand
the
king
by
this
is
set
him
down
to
sleep
what
will
he
not
to
bed
why
no
for
he
hath
made
a
solemn
vow
never
to
lie
and
take
his
natural
rest
till
warwick
or
himself
be
quite
suppressd
tomorrow
then
belike
shall
be
the
day
if
warwick
be
so
near
as
men
report
but
say
i
pray
what
nobleman
is
that
that
with
the
king
here
resteth
in
his
tent
tis
the
lord
hastings
the
kings
chiefest
friend
o
is
it
so
but
why
commands
the
king
that
his
chief
followers
lodge
in
towns
about
him
while
he
himself
keeps
in
the
cold
field
tis
the
more
honour
because
the
more
dangerous
ay
but
give
me
worship
and
quietness
i
like
it
better
than
a
dangerous
honour
if
warwick
knew
in
what
estate
he
stands
tis
to
be
doubted
he
would
waken
him
unless
our
halberds
did
shut
up
his
passage
ay
wherefore
else
guard
we
his
royal
tent
but
to
defend
his
person
from
nightfoes
this
is
his
tent
and
see
where
stand
his
guard
courage
my
masters
honour
now
or
never
but
follow
me
and
edward
shall
be
ours
who
goes
there
stay
or
thou
diest
what
are
they
that
fly
there
richard
and
hastings
let
them
go
heres
the
duke
the
duke
why
warwick
when
we
parted
last
thou
calldst
me
king
ay
but
the
case
is
alterd
when
you
disgracd
me
in
my
embassade
then
i
degraded
you
from
being
king
and
come
now
to
create
you
duke
of
york
alas
how
should
you
govern
any
kingdom
that
know
not
how
to
use
ambassadors
nor
how
to
be
contented
with
one
wife
nor
how
to
use
your
brothers
brotherly
nor
how
to
study
for
the
peoples
welfare
nor
how
to
shroud
yourself
from
enemies
yea
brother
of
clarence
art
thou
here
too
nay
then
i
see
that
edward
needs
must
down
yet
warwick
in
despite
of
all
mischance
of
thee
thyself
and
all
thy
complices
edward
will
always
bear
himself
as
king
though
fortunes
malice
overthrow
my
state
my
mind
exceeds
the
compass
of
her
wheel
then
for
his
mind
be
edward
englands
king
but
henry
now
shall
wear
the
english
crown
and
be
true
king
indeed
thou
but
the
shadow
my
lord
of
somerset
at
my
request
see
that
forthwith
duke
edward
be
conveyd
unto
my
brother
archbishop
of
york
when
i
have
fought
with
pembroke
and
his
fellows
ill
follow
you
and
tell
what
answer
lewis
and
the
lady
bona
send
to
him
now
for
a
while
farewell
good
duke
of
york
what
fates
impose
that
men
must
needs
abide
it
boots
not
to
resist
both
wind
and
tide
what
now
remains
my
lords
for
us
to
do
but
march
to
london
with
our
soldiers
ay
thats
the
first
thing
that
we
have
to
do
to
free
king
henry
from
imprisonment
and
see
him
seated
in
the
regal
throne
madam
what
makes
you
in
this
sudden
change
why
brother
rivers
are
you
yet
to
learn
what
late
misfortune
is
befalln
king
edward
what
loss
of
some
pitchd
battle
against
warwick
no
but
the
loss
of
his
own
royal
person
then
is
my
sovereign
slain
ay
almost
slain
for
he
is
taken
prisoner
either
betrayd
by
falsehood
of
his
guard
or
by
his
foe
surprisd
at
unawares
and
as
i
further
have
to
understand
is
new
committed
to
the
bishop
of
york
fell
warwicks
brother
and
by
that
our
foe
these
news
i
must
confess
are
full
of
grief
yet
gracious
madam
bear
it
as
you
may
warwick
may
lose
that
now
hath
won
the
day
till
then
fair
hope
must
hinder
lifes
decay
and
i
the
rather
wean
me
from
despair
for
love
of
edwards
offspring
in
my
womb
this
is
it
that
makes
me
bridle
passion
and
bear
with
mildness
my
misfortunes
cross
ay
ay
for
this
i
draw
in
many
a
tear
and
stop
the
rising
of
bloodsucking
sighs
lest
with
my
sighs
or
tears
i
blast
or
drown
king
edwards
fruit
true
heir
to
the
english
crown
but
madam
where
is
warwick
then
become
i
am
informd
that
he
comes
towards
london
to
set
the
crown
once
more
on
henrys
head
guess
thou
the
rest
king
edwards
friends
must
down
but
to
prevent
the
tyrants
violence
for
trust
not
him
that
hath
once
broken
faith
ill
hence
forthwith
unto
the
sanctuary
to
save
at
least
the
heir
of
edwards
right
there
shall
i
rest
secure
from
force
and
fraud
come
therefore
let
us
fly
while
we
may
fly
if
warwick
take
us
we
are
sure
to
die
now
my
lord
hastings
and
sir
william
stanley
leave
off
to
wonder
why
i
drew
you
hither
into
this
chiefest
thicket
of
the
park
thus
stands
the
case
you
know
our
king
my
brother
is
prisoner
to
the
bishop
here
at
whose
hands
he
hath
good
usage
and
great
liberty
and
often
but
attended
with
weak
guard
comes
hunting
this
way
to
disport
himself
i
have
advertisd
him
by
secret
means
that
if
about
this
hour
he
make
this
way
under
the
colour
of
his
usual
game
he
shall
here
find
his
friends
with
horse
and
men
to
set
him
free
from
his
captivity
this
way
my
lord
for
this
way
lies
the
game
nay
this
way
man
see
where
the
huntsmen
stand
now
brother
of
gloucester
lord
hastings
and
the
rest
stand
you
thus
close
to
steal
the
bishops
deer
brother
the
time
and
case
requireth
haste
your
horse
stands
ready
at
the
park
corner
but
whither
shall
we
then
to
lynn
my
lord
and
ship
from
thence
to
flanders
well
guessd
believe
me
for
that
was
my
meaning
stanley
i
will
requite
thy
forwardness
but
wherefore
stay
we
tis
no
time
to
talk
huntsman
what
sayst
thou
wilt
thou
go
along
better
do
so
than
tarry
and
be
hangd
come
then
away
lets
ha
no
more
ado
bishop
farewell
shield
thee
from
warwicks
frown
and
pray
that
i
may
repossess
the
crown
master
lieutenant
now
that
god
and
friends
have
shaken
edward
from
the
regal
seat
and
turnd
my
captive
state
to
liberty
my
fear
to
hope
my
sorrows
unto
joys
at
our
enlargement
what
are
thy
due
fees
subjects
may
challenge
nothing
of
their
sovereigns
but
if
a
humble
prayer
may
prevail
i
then
crave
pardon
of
your
majesty
for
what
lieutenant
for
well
using
me
nay
be
thou
sure
ill
well
requite
thy
kindness
for
that
it
made
my
imprisonment
a
pleasure
ay
such
a
pleasure
as
encaged
birds
conceive
when
after
many
moody
thoughts
at
last
by
notes
of
household
harmony
they
quite
forget
their
loss
of
liberty
but
warwick
after
god
thou
setst
me
free
and
chiefly
therefore
i
thank
god
and
thee
he
was
the
author
thou
the
instrument
therefore
that
i
may
conquer
fortunes
spite
by
living
low
where
fortune
cannot
hurt
me
and
that
the
people
of
this
blessed
land
may
not
be
punishd
with
my
thwarting
stars
warwick
although
my
head
still
wear
the
crown
i
here
resign
my
government
to
thee
for
thou
art
fortunate
in
all
thy
deeds
your
grace
hath
still
been
famd
for
virtuous
and
now
may
seem
as
wise
as
virtuous
by
spying
and
avoiding
fortunes
malice
for
few
men
rightly
temper
with
the
stars
yet
in
this
one
thing
let
me
blame
your
grace
for
choosing
me
when
clarence
is
in
place
no
warwick
thou
art
worthy
of
the
sway
to
whom
the
heavens
in
thy
nativity
adjudgd
an
olive
branch
and
laurel
crown
as
likely
to
be
blest
in
peace
and
war
and
therefore
i
yield
thee
my
free
consent
and
i
choose
clarence
only
for
protector
warwick
and
clarence
give
me
both
your
hands
now
join
your
hands
and
with
your
hands
your
hearts
that
no
dissension
hinder
government
i
make
you
both
protectors
of
this
land
while
i
myself
will
lead
a
private
life
and
in
devotion
spend
my
latter
days
to
sins
rebuke
and
my
creators
praise
what
answers
clarence
to
his
sovereigns
will
that
he
consents
if
warwick
yield
consent
for
on
thy
fortune
i
repose
myself
why
then
though
loath
yet
must
i
be
content
well
yoke
together
like
a
double
shadow
to
henrys
body
and
supply
his
place
i
mean
in
bearing
weight
of
government
while
he
enjoys
the
honour
and
his
ease
and
clarence
now
then
it
is
more
than
needful
forthwith
that
edward
be
pronouncd
a
traitor
and
all
his
lands
and
goods
be
confiscate
what
else
and
that
succession
be
determind
ay
therein
clarence
shall
not
want
his
part
but
with
the
first
of
all
your
chief
affairs
let
me
entreat
for
i
command
no
more
that
margaret
your
queen
and
my
son
edward
be
sent
for
to
return
from
france
with
speed
for
till
i
see
them
here
by
doubtful
fear
my
joy
of
liberty
is
half
eclipsd
it
shall
be
done
my
sovreign
with
all
speed
my
lord
of
somerset
what
youth
is
that
of
whom
you
seem
to
have
so
tender
care
my
liege
it
is
young
henry
earl
of
richmond
come
hither
englands
hope
if
secret
powers
suggest
but
truth
to
my
divining
thoughts
this
pretty
lad
will
prove
our
countrys
bliss
his
looks
are
full
of
peaceful
majesty
his
head
by
nature
framd
to
wear
a
crown
his
hand
to
wield
a
sceptre
and
himself
likely
in
time
to
bless
a
regal
throne
make
much
of
him
my
lords
for
this
is
he
must
help
you
more
than
you
are
hurt
by
me
what
news
my
friend
that
edward
is
escaped
from
your
brother
and
fled
as
he
hears
since
to
burgundy
unsavoury
news
but
how
made
he
escape
he
was
conveyd
by
richard
duke
of
gloucester
and
the
lord
hastings
who
attended
him
in
secret
ambush
on
the
forest
side
and
from
the
bishops
huntsmen
rescud
him
for
hunting
was
his
daily
exercise
my
brother
was
too
careless
of
his
charge
but
let
us
hence
my
sovereign
to
provide
a
salve
for
any
sore
that
may
betide
my
lord
i
like
not
of
this
flight
of
edwards
for
doubtless
burgundy
will
yield
him
help
and
we
shall
have
more
wars
beforet
be
long
as
henrys
late
presaging
prophecy
did
glad
my
heart
with
hope
of
this
young
richmond
so
doth
my
heart
misgive
me
in
these
conflicts
what
may
befall
him
to
his
harm
and
ours
therefore
lord
oxford
to
prevent
the
worst
forthwith
well
send
him
hence
to
brittany
till
storms
be
past
of
civil
enmity
ay
for
if
edward
repossess
the
crown
tis
like
that
richmond
with
the
rest
shall
down
it
shall
be
so
he
shall
to
brittany
come
therefore
lets
about
it
speedily
now
brother
richard
lord
hastings
and
the
rest
yet
thus
far
fortune
maketh
us
amends
and
says
that
once
more
i
shall
interchange
my
waned
state
for
henrys
regal
crown
well
have
we
passd
and
now
repassd
the
seas
and
brought
desired
help
from
burgundy
what
then
remains
we
being
thus
arrivd
from
ravenspurgh
haven
before
the
gates
of
york
but
that
we
enter
as
into
our
dukedom
the
gates
made
fast
brother
i
like
not
this
for
many
men
that
stumble
at
the
threshold
are
well
foretold
that
danger
lurks
within
tush
man
abodements
must
not
now
affright
us
by
fair
or
foul
means
we
must
enter
in
for
hither
will
our
friends
repair
to
us
my
liege
ill
knock
once
more
to
summon
them
my
lords
we
were
forewarned
of
your
coming
and
shut
the
gates
for
safety
of
ourselves
for
now
we
owe
allegiance
unto
henry
but
master
mayor
if
henry
be
your
king
yet
edward
at
the
least
is
duke
of
york
true
my
good
lord
i
know
you
for
no
less
why
and
i
challenge
nothing
but
my
dukedom
as
being
well
content
with
that
alone
but
when
the
fox
hath
once
got
in
his
nose
hell
soon
find
means
to
make
the
body
follow
why
master
mayor
why
stand
you
in
a
doubt
open
the
gates
we
are
king
henrys
friends
ay
say
you
so
the
gates
shall
then
be
opend
a
wise
stout
captain
and
soon
persuaded
the
good
old
man
would
fain
that
all
were
well
so
twere
not
long
of
him
but
being
enterd
i
doubt
not
i
but
we
shall
soon
persuade
both
him
and
all
his
brothers
unto
reason
so
master
mayor
these
gates
must
not
be
shut
but
in
the
night
or
in
the
time
of
war
what
fear
not
man
but
yield
me
up
the
keys
for
edward
will
defend
the
town
and
thee
and
all
those
friends
that
deign
to
follow
me
brother
this
is
sir
john
montgomery
our
trusty
friend
unless
i
be
deceivd
welcome
sir
john
but
why
come
you
in
arms
to
help
king
edward
in
his
time
of
storm
as
every
loyal
subject
ought
to
do
thanks
good
montgomery
but
we
now
forget
our
title
to
the
crown
and
only
claim
our
dukedom
till
god
please
to
send
the
rest
then
fare
you
well
for
i
will
hence
again
i
came
to
serve
a
king
and

a
duke

and

thinks
your
lordship
methinks
the
power
that
edward
hath
in
field

not
be
able
to
encounter
mine
the
doubt
is
that
he
will
seduce
the
rest
thats
not
my
fear
my
meed
hath
got
me
fame
i
have
not
stoppd
mine
ears
to
their
demands
nor
posted
off
their
suits
with
slow
delays
my
pity
hath
been
balm
to
heal
their
wounds
my
mildness
hath
allayd
their
swelling
griefs
my
mercy
dried
their
waterflowing
tears
i
have
not
been
desirous
of
their
wealth
nor
much
oppressd
them
with
great
subsidies
nor
forward
of
revenge
though
they
much
errd
then
why
should
they
love
edward
more
than
me
no
exeter
these
graces
challenge

and
when
the
lion
fawns
upon
the
lamb

humbly
bend
thy
knee
call
edward
king

at
his
hands
beg
mercy
and
he
shall
pardon
thee
these
outrages

forces
hence
confess
who
set
thee
up
and
pluckd
thee
down
call
warwick
patron
and
be
penitent
and
thou
shalt
still
remain
the
duke
of
york
i
thought
at
least
he
would
have
said
the
king
or
did
he
make
the
jest
against
his
will

not
a
dukedom

by
my
faith
for

thee
service
for
so
good
a
gift
twas
i
that
gave
the
kingdom
to
thy
brother
why
then
tis
mine
if
but
by
warwicks
gift
thou
art
no
atlas

so
great
a
weight
and
weakling
warwick
takes
his
gift

and
henry
is
my
king
warwick
his
subject
but
warwicks
king
is
edwards
prisoner

but
answer
this
what
is
the
body
when
the
head
is
off
alas
that
warwick
had
no
more
forecast
but
whiles
he
thought
to
steal
the
single
ten
the
king
was
slily
fingerd
from
the
deck
you
left
poor
henry
at
the
bishops
palace
and
ten
to
one
youll
meet
him
in
the

take
the
time
kneel
down
kneel
down
nay
when

now
or

iron
cools
i
had
rather
chop
this
hand
off
at
a
blow
and
with
the
other
fling
it
at
thy
face
than
bear
so
low
a
sail
to
strike
to
thee
sail
how
thou
canst
have
wind
and
tide
thy
friend
this
hand
fast
wound
about
thy
coalblack
hair
shall
whiles
thy
head
is
warm
and
new
cut
off
write
in
the
dust
this
sentence
with
thy
blood
windchanging
warwick
now
can
change
no
more
o
cheerful
colours
see
where
oxford
comes
oxford
oxford
for
lancaster
the
gates
are
open
let
us
enter
too
so
other
foes
may
set
upon
our
backs
stand
we
in
good
array
for
they
no
doubt
will
issue
out
again
and
bid
us
battle
if
not
the
city
being
but
of
small
defence
well
quickly
rouse
the
traitors
in
the
same
o
welcome
oxford
for
we
want
thy
help
montague
montague
for
lancaster
thou
and
thy
brother
both
shall
buy
this
treason
even
with
the
dearest
blood
your
bodies
bear
the
harder
matchd
the
greater
victory
my
mind
presageth
happy
gain
and
conquest
somerset

for
lancaster
two
of
thy
name
both
dukes
of
somerset
have
sold
their
lives
unto
the
house
of
york
and
thou
shalt
be
the
third
if
this
sword
hold
and
lo
where
george
of
clarence
sweeps
along
of
force
enough
to
bid
his
brother
battle
with
whom
an
upright
zeal
to
right
prevails
more
than
the
nature
of
a
brothers
love
come
clarence
come
thou
wilt
if
warwick
call
father
of
warwick
know
you
what
this
means
look
here
i
throw
my
infamy
at
thee
i
will
not
ruinate
my
fathers
house
who
gave
his
blood
to
lime
the
stones
together
and
set
up
lancaster
why
trowst
thou
warwick
that
clarence
is
so
harsh
so
blunt
unnatural
to
bend
the
fatal
instruments
of
war
against
his
brother
and
his
lawful
king
perhaps
thou
wilt
object
my
holy
oath
to
keep
that
oath
were
more
impiety
than
jephthahs
when
he
sacrificd
his
daughter
i
am
so
sorry
for
my
trespass
made
that
to
deserve
well
at
my
brothers
hands
i
here
proclaim
myself
thy
mortal
foe
with
resolution
wheresoeer
i
meet
thee
as
i
will
meet
thee
if
thou
stir
abroad
to
plague
thee
for
thy
foul
misleading
me
and
so
proudhearted
warwick
i
defy
thee
and
to
my
brother
turn
my
blushing
cheeks
pardon
me
edward
i
will
make
amends
and
richard
do
not
frown
upon
my
faults
for
i
will
henceforth
be
no
more
unconstant
now
welcome
more
and
ten
times
more
belovd
than
if
thou
never
hadst
deservd
our
hate
welcome
good
clarence
this
is
brotherlike
o
passing
traitor
perjurd
and
unjust
what
warwick
wilt
thou
leave
the
town
and
fight
or
shall
we
beat
the
stones
about
thine
ears
alas
i
am
not
coopd
here
for
defence
i
will
away
towards
barnet
presently
and
bid
thee
battle
edward
if
thou
darst
yes
warwick
edward
dares
and
leads
the
way
lords
to
the
field
saint
george
and

so
lie

our
fear
for

a
bug
that
feard
us
all
now

for
thee
that
warwicks
bones
may
keep
thine
company
ah
who
is
nigh
come
to
me
friend
or
foe
and
tell
me
who
is
victor
york
or
warwick
why
ask
i
that
my
mangled
body
shows
my
blood
my
want
of
strength
my
sick
heart
shows
that
i
must
yield
my
body
to
the
earth
and
by
my
fall
the
conquest
to
my
foe
thus
yields
the
cedar
to
the
axes
edge
whose
arms
gave
shelter
to
the
princely
eagle
under
whose
shade
the
ramping
lion
slept
whose
top
branch
overpeerd
joves
spreading
tree
and
kept
low
shrubs
from
winters
powerful
wind
these
eyes
that
now
are
dimmd
with
deaths
black
veil
have
been
as
piercing
as
the
midday
sun
to
search
the
secret
treasons
of
the
world
the
wrinkles
in
my
brows
now
filld
with
blood
were
likend
oft
to
kingly
sepulchres
for
who
livd
king
but
i
could
dig
his
grave
and
who
durst
smile
when
warwick
bent
his
brow
lo
now
my
glory
smeard
in
dust
and
blood
my
parks
my
walks
my
manors
that
i
had
even
now
forsake
me
and
of
all
my
lands
is
nothing
left
me
but
my
bodys
length
why
what
is
pomp

but
earth
and
dust
and
live
we
how
we
can
yet
die
we
must
ah
warwick
warwick
wert
thou
as
we
are
we
might
recover
all
our
loss
again
the
queen
from
france
hath
brought
a
puissant
power
even
now
we
heard
the
news
ah
couldst
thou
fly
why
then
i
would
not
fly
ah
montague
if
thou
be
there
sweet
brother
take
my
hand
and
with
thy
lips
keep
in
my
soul
awhile
thou
lovst
me
not
for
brother
if
thou
didst
thy
tears
would
wash
this
cold
congealed
blood
that
glues
my
lips
and
will
not
let
me
speak
come
quickly
montague
or
i
am
dead
ah
warwick
montague
hath
breathd
his
last
and
to
the
latest
gasp
cried
out
for
warwick
and
said
commend
me
to
my
valiant
brother
and
more
he
would
have
said
and
more
he
spoke
which
sounded
like
a
clamour
in
a
vault
that
mought
not
be
distinguishd
but
at
last
i
well
might
hear
deliverd
with
a
groan
o
farewell
warwick
sweet
rest
his
soul
fly
lords
and
save
yourselves
for
warwick
bids
you
all
farewell
to
meet
in
heaven
away
away
to
meet
the
queens
great
power
thus
far
our
fortune
keeps
an
upward
course
and
we
are
gracd
with
wreaths
of
victory
but
in
the
midst
of
this
brightshining
day
i
spy
a
black
suspicious
threatning
cloud
that
will
encounter
with
our
glorious
sun
ere
he
attain
his
easeful
western
bed
i
mean
my
lords
those
powers
that
the
queen
hath
raisd
in
gallia
have
arrivd
our
coast
and
as
we
hear
march
on
to
fight
with
us
a
little
gale
will
soon
disperse
that
cloud
and
blow
it
to
the
source
from
whence
it
came
thy
very
beams
will
dry
those
vapours
up
for
every
cloud
engenders
not
a
storm
the
queen
is
valud
thirty
thousand
strong
and
somerset
with
oxford
fled
to
her
if
she
have
time
to
breathe
be
well
assurd
her
faction
will
be
full
as
strong
as
ours
we
are
advertisd
by
our
loving
friends
that
they
do
hold
their
course
toward
tewksbury
we
having
now
the
best
at
barnet
field
will
thither
straight
for
willingness
rids
way
and
as
we
march
our
strength
will
be
augmented
in
every
county
as
we
go
along
strike
up
the
drum
cry
courage
and
away
great
lords
wise
men
neer
sit
and
wail
their
loss
but
cheerly
seek
how
to
redress
their
harms
what
though
the
mast
be
now
blown
overboard
the
cable
broke
the
holding
anchor
lost
and
half
our
sailors
swallowd
in
the
flood
yet
lives
our
pilot
still
ist
meet
that
he
should
leave
the
helm
and
like
a
fearful
lad
with
tearful
eyes
add
water
to
the
sea
and
give
more
strength
to
that
which
hath
too
much
whiles
in
his
moan
the
ship
splits
on
the
rock
which
industry
and
courage
might
have
savd
ah
what
a
shame
ah
what
a
fault
were
this
say
warwick
was
our
anchor
what
of
that
and
montague
our
topmast
what
of
him
our
slaughterd
friends
the
tackles
what
of
these
why
is
not
oxford
here
another
anchor
and
somerset
another
goodly
mast
the
friends
of
france
our
shrouds
and
tacklings
and
though
unskilful
why
not
ned
and
i
for
once
allowd
the
skilful
pilots
charge
we
will
not
from
the
helm
to
sit
and
weep
but
keep
our
course
though
the
rough
wind
say
no
from
shelves
and
rocks
that
threaten
us
with
wrack
as
good
to
chide
the
waves
as
speak
them
fair
and
what
is
edward
but
a
ruthless
sea
what
clarence
but
a
quicksand
of
deceit
and
richard
but
a
ragged
fatal
rock
all
those
the
enemies
to
our
poor
bark
say
you
can
swim
alas
tis
but
a
while
tread
on
the
sand
why
there
you
quickly
sink
bestride
the
rock
the
tide
will
wash
you
off
or
else
you
famish
thats
a
threefold
death
this
speak
i
lords
to
let
you
understand
in
case
some
one
of
you
would
fly
from
us
that
theres
no
hopdfor
mercy
with
the
brothers
more
than
with
ruthless
waves
with
sands
and
rocks
why
courage
then
what
cannot
be
avoided
twere
childish
weakness
to
lament
or
fear
methinks
a
woman
of
this
valiant
spirit
should
if
a
coward
heard
her
speak
these
words
infuse
his
breast
with
magnanimity
and
make
him
naked
foil
a
man
at
arms
i
speak
not
this
as
doubting
any
here
for
did
i
but
suspect
a
fearful
man
he
should
have
leave
to
go
away
betimes
lest
in
our
need
he
might
infect
another
and
make
him
of
like
spirit
to
himself
if
any
such
be
here
as
god
forbid
let
him
depart
before
we
need
his
help
women
and
children
of
so
high
a
courage
and
warriors
faint
why
twere
perpetual
shame
o
brave
young
prince
thy
famous
grandfather
doth
live
again
in
thee
long
mayst
thou
live
to
bear
his
image
and
renew
his
glories
and
he
that
will
not
fight
for
such
a
hope
go
home
to
bed
and
like
the
owl
by
day
if
he
arise
be
mockd
and
wonderd
at
thanks
gentle
somerset
sweet
oxford
thanks
and
take
his
thanks
that
yet
hath
nothing
else
prepare
you
lords
for
edward
is
at
hand
ready
to
fight
therefore
be
resolute
i
thought
no
less
it
is
his
policy
to
haste
thus
fast
to
find
us
unprovided
but
hes
deceivd
we
are
in
readiness
this
cheers
my
heart
to
see
your
forwardness
here
pitch
our
battle
hence
we
will
not
budge
brave
followers
yonder
stands
the
thorny
wood
which
by
the
heavens
assistance
and
your
strength
must
by
the
roots
be
hewn
up

ere
night
i
need
not
add
more
fuel
to
your
fire

killd
why
what
a
peevish
fool
was
that
of
crete
that
taught
his
son
the
office
of
a
fowl
and
yet
for
all
his

the
fool
was
drownd
i

wherefore
dost
thou
come

life
thinkst
thou
i
am
an
executioner
a
persecutor
i
am
sure
thou

thou
been

when

thou
didst

ill

after
this
o

forgive
my
sins
and
pardon
thee
what
will
the
aspiring
blood
of
lancaster
sink
in
the
ground
i
thought
it
would
have
mounted
see
how
my

weeps
for
the
poor
kings
death
o
may
such
purple
tears
be
always
shed
from
those
that
wish
the
downfall
of
our
house
if
any
spark
of

be
yet
remaining
down
down
to
hell
and
say
i
sent
thee
thither
i
that
have
neither
pity
love
nor
fear
indeed
tis
true
that
henry
told
me
of
for
i
have
often
heard
my
mother
say
i
came
into
the
world
with
my
legs
forward
had
i
not
reason
think
ye
to
make
haste
and
seek
their
ruin
that
usurpd
our
right
the
midwife
wonderd
and
the
women
cried
o
jesus
bless
us
he
is
born
with
teeth
and
so
i
was
which
plainly
signified
that
i
should
snarl
and
bite
and
play
the
dog
then
since
the
heavens
have
shapd
my
body
so
let
hell
make
crookd
my
mind
to
answer
it
i
have
no

i
am
like

and
this
word

clarence
beware
thou
keepst
me
from

light
but
i
will
sort
a
pitchy
day
for
thee
for
i
will
buzz
abroad

prophecies
that

be
fearful
of
his

and
then
to
purge
his
fear
ill
be
thy
death
king
henry
and

bad
till

thomas
mowbray
i
have
my
liege
tell
me
moreover
hast
thou
sounded
him
if
he
appeal
the
duke
on
ancient
malice
or
worthily
as
a
good
subject
should
on
some
known
ground
of
treachery
in
him
as
near
as
i
could
sift
him
on
that
argument
on
some
apparent
danger
seen
in
him
aimd
at
your
highness
no
inveterate
malice
then
call
them
to
our
presence
face
to
face
and
frowning
brow
to
brow
ourselves
will
hear
the
accuser
and
the
accused
freely
speak
highstomachd
are
they
both
and
full
of
ire
in
rage
deaf
as
the
sea
hasty
as

many
years
of
happy
days
befall
my
gracious
sovereign
my
most
loving

an
immortal
title
to

we
thank
you
both
yet

but
flatters
us
as
well
appeareth
by
the
cause
you
come
namely
to
appeal
each
other
of
high
treason
cousin
of
hereford
what
dost
thou
object
against
the
duke
of
norfolk
thomas
mowbray
first
heaven
be
the
record
to
my
speech
in
the
devotion
of
a
subjects
love
tendering
the
precious
safety
of
my
prince
and
free
from
other
misbegotten
hate
come
i
appellant
to
this
princely
presence
now
thomas
mowbray
do
i
turn
to
thee
and
mark
my
greeting
well
for
what
i
speak
my
body
shall
make
good
upon
this
earth
or
my
divine
soul
answer
it
in
heaven
thou
art
a
traitor
and
a
miscreant
too
good
to
be
so
and
too
bad
to
live
since
the
more
fair
and
crystal
is
the
sky
the
uglier
seem
the
clouds
that
in
it
fly
once
more
the
more
to
aggravate
the
note
with
a
foul
traitors
name
stuff
i
thy
throat
and
wish
so
please
my
sovereign
ere
i
move
what
my
tongue
speaks
my
right
drawn
sword
may
prove
let
not
my
cold
words
here
accuse
my
zeal
tis
not
the
trial
of
a
womans
war
the
bitter
clamour
of
two
eager
tongues
can
arbitrate
this
cause
betwixt
us
twain
the
blood
is
hot
that
must
be
coold
for
this
yet
can
i
not
of
such
tame
patience
boast
as
to
be
hushd
and
nought
at
all
to
say
first
the
fair
reverence
of
your
highness
curbs
me
from
giving
reins
and
spurs
to
my
free
speech
which
else
would
post
until
it
had
returnd
these
terms
of
treason
doubled
down
his
throat
setting
aside
his
high
bloods
royalty
and
let
him
be
no
kinsman
to
my
liege
i
do
defy
him
and
i
spit
at
him
call
him
a
slanderous
coward
and
a
villain
which
to
maintain
i
would
allow
him
odds
and
meet
him
were
i
tied
to
run
afoot
even
to
the
frozen
ridges
of
the
alps
or
any
other
ground
inhabitable
wherever
englishman
durst
set
his
foot
meantime
let
this
defend
my
loyalty
by
all
my
hopes
most
falsely
doth
he
lie
pale
trembling
coward
there
i
throw
my
gage
disclaiming
here
the
kindred
of
the
king
and
lay
aside
my
high
bloods
royalty
which
fear
not
reverence
makes
thee
to
except
if
guilty
dread
have
left
thee
so
much
strength
as
to
take
up
mine
honours
pawn
then
stoop
by
that
and
all
the
rites
of
knighthood
else
will
i
make
good
against
thee
arm
to
arm
what
i
have
spoke
or
thou
canst
worse
devise
i
take
it
up
and
by
that
sword
i
swear
which
gently
laid
my
knighthood
on
my
shoulder
ill
answer
thee
in
any
fair
degree
or
chivalrous
design
of
knightly
trial
and
when
i
mount
alive
may
i
not
light
if
i
be
traitor
or
unjustly
fight
what
doth
our
cousin
lay
to
mowbrays
charge
it
must
be
great
that
can
inherit
us
so
much
as
of
a
thought
of
ill
in
him
look
what
i
speak
my
life
shall
prove
it
true
that
mowbray
hath
receivd
eight
thousand
nobles
in
name
of
lendings
for
your
highness
soldiers
the
which
he
hath
detaind
for
lewd
employments
like
a
false
traitor
and
injurious
villain
besides
i
say
and
will
in
battle
prove
or
here
or
elsewhere
to
the
furthest
verge
that
ever
was
surveyd
by
english
eye
that
all
the
treasons
for
these
eighteen
years
complotted
and
contrived
in
this
land
fetch
from
false
mowbray
their
first
head
and
spring
further
i
say
and
further
will
maintain
upon
his
bad
life
to
make
all
this
good
that
he
did
plot
the
duke
of
gloucesters
death
suggest
his
soon
believing
adversaries
and
consequently
like
a
traitor
coward
sluicd
out
his
innocent
soul
through
streams
of
blood
which
blood
like
sacrificing
abels
cries
even
from
the
tongueless
caverns
of
the
earth
to
me
for
justice
and
rough
chastisement
and
by
the
glorious
worth
of
my
descent
this
arm
shall
do
it
or
this
life
be
spent
how
high
a
pitch
his
resolution
soars
thomas
of
norfolk
what
sayst
thou
to
this
o
let
my
sovereign
turn
away
his
face
and
bid
his
ears
a
little
while
be
deaf
till
i
have
told
this
slander
of
his
blood
how
god
and
good
men
hate
so
foul
a
liar
mowbray
impartial
are
our
eyes
and
ears
were
he
my
brother
nay
my
kingdoms
heir
as
he
is
but
my
fathers
brothers
son
now
by
my
sceptres
awe
i
make
a
vow
such
neighbour
nearness
to
our
sacred
blood
should
nothing
privilege
him
nor
partialize
the
unstooping
firmness
of
my
upright
soul
he
is
our
subject
mowbray
so
art
thou
free
speech
and
fearless
i
to
thee
allow
then
bolingbroke
as
low
as
to
thy
heart
through
the
false
passage
of
thy
throat
thou
liest
three
parts
of
that
receipt
i
had
for
calais
disbursd
i
duly
to
his
highness
soldiers
the
other
part
reservd
i
by
consent
for
that
my
sovereign
liege
was
in
my
debt
upon
remainder
of
a
dear
account
since
last
i
went
to
france
to
fetch
his
queen
now
swallow
down
that
lie
for
gloucesters
death
i
slew
him
not
but
to
mine
own
disgrace
neglected
my
sworn
duty
in
that
case
for
you
my
noble
lord
of
lancaster
the
honourable
father
to
my
foe
once
did
i
lay
an
ambush
for
your
life
a
trespass
that
doth
vex
my
grieved
soul
but
ere
i
last
receivd
the
sacrament
i
did
confess
it
and
exactly
beggd
your
graces
pardon
and
i
hope
i
had
it
this
is
my
fault
as
for
the
rest
appeald
it
issues
from
the
rancour
of
a
villain
a
recreant
and
most
degenerate
traitor
which
in
myself
i
boldly
will
defend
and
interchangeably
hurl
down
my
gage
upon
this
overweening
traitors
foot
to
prove
myself
a
loyal
gentleman
even
in
the
best

set
on

lent
shall
point
on

gild
my

norfolk
for
thee
remains
a
heavier
doom
which
i
with
some
unwillingness
pronounce
the
sly
slow
hours
shall
not
determinate
the
dateless
limit
of
thy
dear
exile
the
hopeless
word
of
never

breathe
i
against

upon

a
heavy
sentence
my
most
sovereign
liege

all
unlookd

mouth
a

merit
not
so
deep
a

i
deserved
at

the

i
have
learnd
these
forty

my
native
english
now
i
must
forego
and
now
my
tongues
use
is
to
me
no
more
than
an
unstringed
viol
or
a
harp
or
like
a
cunning
instrument
casd
up
or
being
open
put
into
his

that
knows
no
touch
to
tune
the
harmony
within
my

you
have
engaold
my

doubly
portcullisd
with
my
teeth

and
dull
unfeeling
barren
ignorance
is
made
my
gaoler
to
attend
on
me
i
am
too
old
to
fawn
upon
a
nurse
too
far
in
years
to
be
a
pupil
now
what
is
thy
sentence
then
but
speechless
death
which
robs
my
tongue
from
breathing
native
breath
it
boots
thee
not
to
be
compassionate
after
our
sentence
plaining
comes
too
late
then
thus
i
turn
me
from
my
countrys
light
to
dwell
in
solemn
shades
of
endless
night
return
again
and
take
an
oath
with
thee

your

mine
enemy
by
this

one
of

had
wanderd
in

banishd
this
frail
sepulchre
of

back
to
england
all
the

sad
aspect
hath
from
the
number
of
his
banishd
years
pluckd
four
away
six
frozen
winters
spent

with
welcome
home
from

how
long
a
time
lies
in
one
little
word
four
lagging
winters
and
four
wanton
springs
end
in
a
word
such
is
the
breath
of
kings
i
thank
my
liege
that
in
regard
of
me
he
shortens
four
years
of
my
sons
exile
but
little
vantage
shall
i
reap
thereby
for
ere
the
six
years
that
he
hath
to
spend
can
change
their
moons
and
bring
their
times
about
my
oildried
lamp
and
timebewasted
light
shall
be
extinct
with
age
and
endless
night
my
inch
of
taper
will
be
burnt
and
done
and
blindfold
death
not
let
me
see
my

thou
hast
many
years
to
live

not

thou
canst
give
shorten
my
days
thou
canst
with
sullen
sorrow
and
pluck
nights
from
me
but
not
lend
a
morrow
thou
canst
help
time
to
furrow
me
with
age
but
stop
no
wrinkle
in
his
pilgrimage
thy
word
is
current
with
him
for
my
death

dead
thy

cannot
buy
my

thy

is
banishd
upon
good
advice
whereto

thou
then
to
lower
things
sweet
to

in
digestion
sour
you
urgd
me
as
a
judge
but
i
had
rather
you
would
have
bid
me
argue
like
a
father
o
had
it
been
a
stranger
not
my
child
to
smooth
his
fault
i
should
have
been
more
mild
a
partial
slander
sought
i
to
avoid
and
in
the
sentence
my

destroyd
alas
i
lookd
when
some
of
you
should
say
i
was
too
strict
to
make
mine
own
away
but
you
gave
leave
to
my
unwilling
tongue
against
my
will
to
do
myself
this
wrong
cousin
farewell
and
uncle
bid
him
so
six
years
we
banish
him
and
he
shall
go
cousin
farewell
what
presence
must
not
know
from
where
you
do
remain
let
paper
show
my
lord
no
leave
take
i
for
i
will
ride
as
far
as
land
will
let
me
by
your
side
o
to
what
purpose
dost
thou
hoard
thy
words
that
thou
returnst
no
greeting
to
thy
friends
i
have
too
few
to
take
my
leave
of
you
when
the
tongues
office
should
be
prodigal
to
breathe
the
abundant
dolour
of
the
heart
thy
grief
is
but
thy
absence
for
a
time
joy
absent
grief
is
present
for
that
time
what
is
six
winters
they
are
quickly
gone
to
men
in
joy
but
grief
makes
one
hour
ten
call
it
a
travel
that
thou
takst
for
pleasure
my
heart
will
sigh
when
i
miscall
it
so
which
finds
it
an
inforced
pilgrimage
the
sullen
passage
of
thy
weary
steps
esteem
as
foil
wherein
thou
art
to
set
the
precious
jewel
of
thy
home
return
nay
rather
every
tedious
stride
i
make
will
but
remember
me
what
a
deal
of
world
i
wander
from
the
jewels
that
i
love
must
i
not
serve
a
long
apprenticehood
to
foreign
passages
and
in
the
end
having
my
freedom
boast
of
nothing
else
but
that
i
was
a
journeyman
to
grief
all
places
that
the
eye
of
heaven
visits
are
to
a
wise
man
ports
and
happy
havens
teach
thy
necessity
to
reason
thus
there
is
no
virtue
like
necessity
think
not
the
king
did
banish
thee
but
thou
the
king
woe
doth
the
heavier
sit
where
it
perceives
it
is
but
faintly
borne
go
say
i
sent
thee
forth
to
purchase
honour
and
not
the
king
exild
thee
or
suppose
devouring
pestilence
hangs
in
our
air
and
thou
art
flying
to
a
fresher
clime
look
what
thy
soul
holds
dear
imagine
it
to
lie
that
way
thou
gost
not
whence
thou
comst
suppose
the
singing
birds
musicians
the
grass
whereon
thou
treadst
the
presence
strewd
the
flowers
fair
ladies
and
thy
steps
no
more
than
a
delightful
measure
or
a
dance
for
gnarling
sorrow
hath
less
power
to
bite
the
man
that
mocks
at
it
and
sets
it
light
o
who
can
hold
a
fire
in
his
hand
by
thinking
on
the
frosty
caucasus
or
cloy
the
hungry
edge
of
appetite
by
bare
imagination
of
a
feast
or
wallow
naked
in
december
snow
by
thinking
on
fantastic
summers
heat
o
no
the
apprehension
of
the
good
gives
but
the
greater
feeling
to
the
worse
fell
sorrows
tooth
doth
never
rankle
more
than
when
it
bites
but
lanceth
not
the
sore
come
come
my
son
ill
bring
thee
on
thy
way
had
i
thy
youth
and
cause
i
would
not
stay
then
englands
ground
farewell
sweet
soil
adieu
my
mother
and
my
nurse
that
bears
me
yet
whereer
i
wander
boast
of
this
i
can
though
banishd
yet
a
trueborn
englishman
we
did
observe
cousin
aumerle
how
far
brought
you
high
hereford
on
his
way
i
brought
high
hereford
if
you
call
him
so
but
to
the
next
highway
and
there
i
left
him
and
say
what
store
of
parting
tears
were
shed
faith
none
for
me
except
the
northeast
wind
which
then
blew
bitterly
against
our
faces
awakd
the
sleeping
rheum
and
so
by
chance
did
grace
our
hollow
parting
with
a
tear
what
said
our
cousin
when
you
parted
with
him
farewell
and
for
my
heart
disdained
that
my
tongue
should
so
profane
the
word
that
taught
me
craft
to
counterfeit
oppression
of
such
grief
that
words
seemd
buried
in
my
sorrows
grave
marry
would
the
word
farewell
have
lengthend
hours
and
added
years
to
his
short
banishment
he
should
have
had
a
volume
of
farewells
but
since
it
would
not
he
had
none
of
me
he
is
our
cousin
cousin
but
tis
doubt
when
time
shall
call
him
home
from
banishment
whether
our
kinsman
come
to
see
his
friends
ourself
and
bushy
bagot
here
and
green
observd
his
courtship
to
the
common
people
how
he
did
seem
to
dive
into
their
hearts
with
humble
and
familiar
courtesy
what
reverence
he
did
throw
away
on
slaves
wooing
poor
craftsmen
with
the
craft
of
smiles
and
patient
underbearing
of
his
fortune
as
twere
to
banish
their
affects
with
him
off
goes
his
bonnet
to
an
oysterwench
a
brace
of
draymen
bid
god
speed
him
well
and
had
the
tribute
of
his
supple
knee
with
thanks
my
countrymen
my
loving
friends
as
were
our
england
in
reversion
his
and
he
our
subjects
next
degree
in
hope
well
he
is
gone
and
with
him
go
these
thoughts
now
for
the
rebels
which
stand
out
in
ireland
expedient
manage

be
made
my
liege

further
leisure
yield
them
further
means
for
their
advantage
and
your
highness

we
will
ourself
in
person
to
this
war
and
for
our
coffers
with
too
great
a
court
and
liberal
largess

grown
somewhat
light
we
are
enforcd
to
farm
our
royal
realm
the
revenue
whereof

furnish
us
for
our
affairs

short
our
substitutes
at

have
blank
charters
whereto
when
they
shall
know

soldiers
for
these
irish
wars
come
gentlemen
lets
all
go
visit
him
pray
god
we
may
make
haste
and
come
too
late
amen
will
the
king
come
that
i
may
breathe
my
last
in
wholesome
counsel
to
his
unstaid
youth
vex
not
yourself
nor
strive
not
with
your
breath
for
all
in
vain
comes
counsel
to
his
ear
o
but
they
say
the
tongues
of
dying
men
enforce
attention
like
deep
harmony
where
words
are
scarce
they
are
seldom
spent
in
vain
for
they
breathe
truth
that
breathe
their
words
in
pain
he
that
no
more
must
say
is
listend
more
than
they
whom
youth
and
ease
have
taught
to
glose
more
are
mens
ends
markd
than
their
lives
before
the
setting
sun
and
music
at
the
close
as
the
last
taste
of
sweets
is
sweetest
last
writ
in
remembrance
more
than
things
long
past
though
richard
my
lifes
counsel
would
not
hear
my
deaths
sad
tale
may
yet
undeaf
his
ear
no
it
is
stoppd
with
other
flattering
sounds
as
praises
of
his
state
then
there
are
fond
lascivious
metres
to
whose
venom
sound
the
open
ear
of
youth
doth
always
listen
report
of
fashions
in
proud
italy
whose
manners
still
our
tardy
apish
nation
limps
after
in
base
imitation
where
doth
the
world
thrust
forth
a
vanity
so
it
be
new
theres
no
respect
how
vile
that
is
not
quickly
buzzd
into
his
ears
then
all
too
late
comes
counsel
to
be
heard
where
will
doth
mutiny
with
wits
regard
direct
not
him
whose
way
himself
will
choose
tis
breath
thou
lackst
and
that
breath
wilt
thou
lose
methinks
i
am
a
prophet
new
inspird
and
thus
expiring
do
foretell
of
him
his
rash
fierce
blaze
of
riot
cannot
last
for
violent
fires
soon
burn
out
themselves
small
showers
last
long
but
sudden
storms
are
short
he
tires
betimes
that
spurs
too
fast

with
eager
feeding
food

it
ends
a
mortal
woe
the
ripest
fruit
first
falls
and
so
doth
he
his
time
is
spent
our
pilgrimage
must
be
so
much
for
that
now
for
our
irish
wars
we
must
supplant
those
rough
rugheaded
kerns
which
live
like
venom
where
no
venom
else
but
only
they
have
privilege
to
live
and
for
these
great
affairs
do
ask
some
charge
towards
our
assistance
we
do
seize
to
us
the

coin
revenues

whereof
our

gaunt
did
stand
possessd
how

not
gloucesters

banishment
not
gaunts
rebukes
nor
englands
private
wrongs
nor
the
prevention
of
poor
bolingbroke
about
his

ever
made
me
sour
my

when

spent
not
that
which
his
triumphant
fathers

guilty
of

the
duke
of
lancaster
is
dead
and
living
too
for
now
his
son
is
duke
barely
in
title
not
in
revenue
richly
in
both
if
justice
had
her
right
my
heart
is
great
but
it
must
break
with
silence
eret
be
disburdend
with
a
liberal
tongue
nay
speak
thy
mind
and
let
him
neer
speak
more
that
speaks
thy
words
again
to
do
thee
harm
tends
that
thoudst
speak
to
the
duke
of
hereford
if
it
be
so
out
with
it
boldly
man
quick
is
mine
ear
to
hear
of
good
towards
him
no
good
at
all
that
i
can
do
for
him
unless
you
call
it
good
to
pity
him
bereft
and
gelded
of
his
patrimony
now
afore
god
tis
shame
such
wrongs
are
borne
in
him
a
royal
prince
and
many
more
of
noble
blood
in
this
declining
land
the
king
is
not
himself
but
basely
led
by
flatterers
and
what
they
will
inform
merely
in
hate
gainst
any
of
us
all
that
will
the
king
severely
prosecute
gainst
us
our
lives
our
children
and
our
heirs
the
commons
hath
he
pilld
with
grievous
taxes
and
quite
lost
their
hearts
the
nobles
hath
he
find
for
ancient
quarrels
and
quite
lost
their
hearts
and
daily
new
exactions
are
devisd
as
blanks
benevolences
and
i
wot
not
what
but
what
o
gods
name
doth
become
of
this
wars
have
not
wasted
it
for
warrd
he
hath
not
but
basely
yielded
upon
compromise
that
which
his
ancestors
achievd
with
blows
more
hath
he
spent
in
peace
than
they
in
wars
the
earl
of
wiltshire
hath
the
realm
in
farm
the
kings
grown
bankrupt
like
a
broken
man
reproach
and
dissolution
hangeth
over
him
he
hath
not
money
for
these
irish
wars
his
burdenous
taxations
notwithstanding
but
by
the
robbing
of
the
banishd
duke
his
noble
kinsman
most
degenerate
king
but
lords
we
hear
this
fearful
tempest
sing
yet
seek
no
shelter
to
avoid
the
storm
we
see
the
wind
sit
sore
upon
our
sails
and
yet
we
strike
not
but
securely
perish
we
see
the
very
wrack
that
we
must
suffer
and
unavoided
is
the
danger
now
for
suffering
so
the
causes
of
our
wrack
not
so
even
through
the
hollow
eyes
of
death
ispy
life
peering
but
i
dare
not
say
how
near
the
tidings
of
our
comfort
is
nay
let
us
share
thy
thoughts
as
thou
dost
ours
be
confident
to
speak
northumberland
we
three
are
but
thyself
and
speaking
so
thy
words
are
but
as
thoughts
therefore
be
bold
then
thus
i
have
from
port
le
blanc
a
bay
in
brittany
receivd
intelligence
that
harry
duke
of
hereford
rainold
lord
cobham
that
late
broke
from
the
duke
of
exeter
his
brother
archbishop
late
of
canterbury
sir
thomas
erpingham
sir
john
ramston
sir
john
norbery
sir
robert
waterton
and
francis
quoint
all
these
well
furnishd
by
the
duke
of
britaine
with
eight
tall
ships
three
thousand
men
of
war
are
making
hither
with
all
due
expedience
and
shortly
mean
to
touch
our
northern
shore
perhaps
they
had
ere
this
but
that
they
stay
the
first
departing
of
the
king
for
ireland
if
then
we
shall
shake
off
our
slavish
yoke
imp
out
our
drooping
countrys
broken
wing
redeem
from
broking
pawn
the
blemishd
crown
wipe
off
the
dust
that
hides
our
sceptres
gilt
and
make
high
majesty
look
like
itself
away
with
me
in
post
to
ravenspurgh
but
if
you
faint
as
fearing
to
do
so
stay
and
be
secret
and
myself
will
go
to
horse
to
horse
urge
doubts
to
them
that
fear
hold
out
my
horse
and
i
will
first
be
there
madam
your
majesty
is
too
much
sad
you
promisd
when
you
parted
with
the
king
to
lay
aside
lifeharming
heaviness
and
entertain
a
cheerful
disposition
to
please
the
king
i
did
to
please
myself
i
cannot
do
it
yet
i
know
no
cause
why
i
should
welcome
such
a
guest
as
grief
save
bidding
farewell
to
so
sweet
a
guest
as
my
sweet
richard
yet
again
methinks
some
unborn
sorrow
ripe
in
fortunes
womb
is
coming
towards
me
and
my
inward
soul
with
nothing
trembles
at
some
thing
it
grieves
more
than
with
parting
from
my
lord
the
king
each
substance
of
a
grief
hath
twenty
shadows
which
show
like
grief
itself
but
are
not
so
for
sorrows
eye
glazed
with
blinding
tears
divides
one
thing
entire
to
many
objects
like
perspectives
which
rightly
gazd
upon
show
nothing
but
confusion
eyd
awry
distinguish
form
so
your
sweet
majesty
looking
awry
upon
your
lords
departure
finds
shapes
of
grief
more
than
himself
to
wail
which
lookd
on
as
it
is
is
nought
but
shadows
of
what
it
is
not
then
thricegracious
queen
more
than
your
lords
departure
weep
not
mores
not
seen
or
if
it
be
tis
with
false
sorrows
eye
which
for
things
true
weeps
things
imaginary
it
may
be
so
but
yet
my
inward
soul
persuades
me
it
is
otherwise
howeer
it
be
i
cannot
but
be
sad
so
heavy
sad
as
though
in
thinking
on
no
thought
i
think
makes
me
with
heavy
nothing
faint
and
shrink
tis
nothing
but
conceit
my
gracious
lady
tis
nothing
less
conceit
is
still
derivd
from
some
forefather
grief
mine
is
not
so
for
nothing
hath
begot
my
something
grief
or
something
hath
the
nothing
that
i
grieve
tis
in
reversion
that
i
do
possess
but
what
it
is
that
is
not
yet
known
what
i
cannot
name
tis
nameless
woe
i
wot
god
save
your
majesty
and
well
met
gentlemen
i
hope
the
king
is
not
yet
shippd
for
ireland
why
hopst
thou
so
tis
better
hope
he
is
for
his
designs
crave
haste
his
haste
good
hope
then
wherefore
dost
thou
hope
he
is
not
shippd
that
he
our
hope
might
have
retird
his
power
and
driven
into
despair
an
enemys
hope
who
strongly
hath
set
footing
in
this
land
the
banishd
bolingbroke
repeals
himself
and
with
uplifted
arms
is
safe
arrivd
at
ravenspurgh
now
god
in
heaven

too
true
and

young
henry
percy
the
lords
of
ross
beaumond
and
willoughby
with
all
their

cozening
hope

is
a
flatterer
a
parasite
a
keeperback

gently
would
dissolve
the
bands
of
life
which
false
hope
lingers
in
extremity
here

duke

signs
of

gods
sake

comfortable
words

i
do
so

should
belie

knave
an
hour
before

duchess

his
mercy
what
a
tide
of
woes
comes
rushing
on
this
woeful
land
at
once
i
know
not
what
to
do
i
would
to
god
so
my
untruth
had
not
provokd
him
to
it
the
king
had
cut
off
my
head
with
my
brothers
what
are
there
no
posts
dispatchd
for
ireland
how
shall
we
do
for
money
for
these
wars

armour
that
is
there
gentlemen
will
you
go
muster
men
if
i
know
how
or
which
way
to
order
these
affairs
thus
thrust
disorderly
into
my
hands
never
believe
me
both
are
my
kinsmen
the
one
is
my
sovereign
whom
both
my
oath
and
duty
bids
defend
the
other
again
is
my
kinsman
whom
the
king
hath
wrongd
whom
conscience
and
my
kindred
bids
to
right
well
somewhat
we
must
do

dispose
of
you
gentlemen
go
muster
up
your
men
and
meet
me
presently
at
berkeley
castle
i
should
to
plashy
too
but
time
will
not
permit
all
is
uneven
and
every
thing
is
left
at
six
and
seven
the
wind
sits
fair
for
news
to
go
to
ireland
but
none
returns
for
us
to
levy
power
proportionable
to
the
enemy
is
all
unpossible
besides
our
nearness
to
the
king
in
love
is
near
the
hate
of
those
love
not
the
king
and
thats
the
wavering
commons
for
their
love
lies
in
their
purses
and
whoso
empties
them
by
so
much
fills
their
hearts
with
deadly
hate
wherein
the
king
stands
generally
condemnd
if
judgment
lie
in
them
then
so
do
we
because
we
ever
have
been
near
the
king
well
ill
for
refuge
straight
to
bristol
castle
the
earl
of
wiltshire
is
already
there
thither
will
i
with
you
for
little
office
will
the
hateful
commons
perform
for
us
except
like
curs
to
tear
us
all
to
pieces
will
you
go
along
with
us
no
i
will
to
ireland
to
his
majesty
farewell
if
hearts
presages
be
not
vain
we
three
here
part
that
neer
shall
meet
again
thats
as
york
thrives
to
beat
back
bolingbroke
alas
poor
duke
the
task
he
undertakes
is
numbering
sands
and
drinking
oceans
dry
where
one
on
his
side
fights
thousands
will
fly
farewell
at
once
for
once
for
all
and
ever
well
we
may
meet
again
i
fear
me
never
how
far
is
it
my
lord
to
berkeley
now
believe
me
noble
lord
i
am
a
stranger
here
in
gloucestershire
these
high
wild
hills
and
rough
uneven
ways
draw
out
our
miles
and
make
them
wearisome
but
yet
your
fair
discourse
hath
been
as
sugar
making
the
hard
way
sweet
and
delectable
but
i
bethink
me
what
a
weary
way
from
ravenspurgh
to
cotswold
will
be
found
in
ross
and
willoughby
wanting
your
company
which
i
protest
hath
very
much
beguild
the
tediousness
and
process
of
my
travel
but
theirs
is
sweetend
with
the
hope
to
have
the
present
benefit
which
i
possess
and
hope
to
joy
is
little
less
in
joy
than
hope
enjoyd
by
this
the
weary
lords
shall
make
their
way
seem
short
as
mine
hath
done
by
sight
of
what
i
have
your
noble
company
of
much
less
value
is
my
company
than
your
good
words
but
who
comes
here
it
is
my
son
young
harry
percy
sent
from
my
brother
worcester
whencesoever
harry
how
fares
your
uncle
i
had
thought
my
lord
to
have
learnd
his
health
of
you
why
is
he
not
with
the
queen
no
my
good
lord
he
hath
forsook
the
court
broken
his
staff
of
office
and
dispersd
the
household
of
the
king
what
was
his
reason
he
was
not
so
resolvd
when
last
we
spake
together
because
your
lordship
was
proclaimed
traitor
but
he
my
lord
is
gone
to
ravenspurgh
to
offer
service
to
the
duke
of
hereford
and
sent
me
over
by
berkeley
to
discover
what
power
the
duke
of
york
had
levied
there
then
with
direction
to
repair
to
ravenspurgh
have
you
forgot
the
duke
of
hereford
boy
no
my
good
lord
for
that
is
not
forgot
which
neer
i
did
remember
to
my
knowledge
i
never
in
my
life
did
look
on
him
then
learn
to
know
him
now
this
is
the
duke
my
gracious
lord
i
tender
you
my
service
such
as
it
is
being
tender
raw
and
young
which
elder
days
shall
ripen
and
confirm
to
more
approved
service
and
desert
i
thank
thee
gentle
percy
and
be
sure
i
count
myself
in
nothing
else
so
happy
as
in
a
soul
remembering
my
good
friends
and
as
my
fortune
ripens
with
thy
love
it
shall
be
still
thy
true
loves
recompense
my
heart
this
covenant
makes
my
hand
thus
seals
it
how
far
is
it
to
berkeley
and
what
stir
keeps
good
old
york
there
with
his
men
of
war
there
stands
the
castle
by
yon
tuft
of
trees
mannd
with
three
hundred
men
as
i
have
heard
and
in
it
are
the
lords
of
york
berkeley
and
seymour
none
else
of
name
and
noble
estimate
here
come
the
lords
of
ross
and
willoughby
bloody
with
spurring
fieryred
with
haste
welcome
my
lords
i
wot
your
love
pursues
a
banishd
traitor
all
my
treasury
is
yet
but
unfelt
thanks
which
more
enrichd
shall
be
your
love
and
labours
recompense
your
presence
makes
us
rich
most
noble
lord
and
far
surmounts
our
labour
to
attain
it
evermore
thanks
the
exchequer
of
the
poor
which
till
my
infant
fortune
comes
to
years
stands
for
my
bounty
but
who
comes
here
it
is
my
lord
of
berkeley
as
i
guess
my
lord
of
hereford
my
message
is
to
you
my
lord
my
answer
is
to
lancaster
and
i
am
come
to
seek
that
name
in
england
and
i
must
find
that
title
in
your
tongue
before
i
make
reply
to
aught
you
say
mistake
me
not
my
lord
tis
not
my
meaning
to
raze
one
title
of
your
honour
out
to
you
my
lord
i
come
what
lord
you
will
from
the
most
gracious
regent
of
this
land
the
duke
of
york
to
know
what
pricks
you
on
to
take
advantage
of
the
absent
time
and
fright
our
native
peace
with
selfborn
arms
i
shall
not
need
transport
my
words
by
you
here
comes
his
grace
in
person
my
noble
uncle
show
me
thy
humble
heart
and
not
thy
knee
whose
duty
is
deceivable
and
false
my
gracious
uncle
tut
tut
grace
me
no
grace
nor
uncle
me
no
uncle
i
am
no
traitors
uncle
and
that
word
grace
in
an
ungracious
mouth
is
but
profane
why
have
those
banishd
and
forbidden
legs
dard
once
to
touch
a
dust
of
englands
ground
but
then
more
why
why
have
they
dard
to
march
so
many
miles
upon
her
peaceful
bosom
frighting
her
palefacd
villages
with
war
and
ostentation
of
despised
arms
comst
thou
because
the
anointed
king
is
hence
why
foolish
boy
the
king
is
left
behind
and
in
my
loyal
bosom
lies
his
power
were
i
but
now
the
lord
of
such
hot
youth
as
when
brave
gaunt
thy
father
and
myself
rescud
the
black
prince

correction
to
thy
fault
my
gracious
uncle

condition
of
the
worst
degree
in
gross
rebellion
and
detested
treason
thou
art
a
banishd
man
and
here
art
come
before
the
expiration
of
thy
time
in
braving
arms
against
thy
sovereign

an
indifferent
eye

gaunt
alive
o
then
my
father
will
you
permit
that

shall
stand
condemnd
a
wandering
vagabond
my
rights
and
royalties
pluckd
from
my
arms
perforce
and
given
away
to
upstart
unthrifts
wherefore
was
i
born
if
that
my
cousin
king
be
king
of
england
it
must
be
granted
i
am
duke
of
lancaster
you
have
a
son
aumerle
my
noble
kinsman
had
you
first
died
and
he
been
thus
trod
down
he
should
have
found
his
uncle
gaunt
a
father
to
rouse
his
wrongs
and
chase
them
to
the
bay
i
am
denied
to
sue
my

the
noble

hath
been
too
much
abusd
it
stands
your

made
great
my
lords

tell
you
this
i
have
had
feeling
of
my
cousins
wrongs
and
labourd
all
i
could
to
do
him
right
but
in
this
kind
to
come
in
braving
arms
be
his
own
carver
and
cut
out
his
way
to
find
out
right
with
wrong
it
may
not
be
and
you
that
do
abet
him
in
this
kind
cherish
rebellion
and

rebels
all
the
noble
duke
hath
sworn
his
coming

but
for
his

and
for
the
right
of

strongly
sworn
to
give
him
aid

oath
well
well
i
see
the
issue
of
these
arms
i
cannot
mend
it
i
must
needs
confess
because
my
power
is
weak
and
all
ill
left
but
if
i
could
by
him
that
gave
me
life
i
would
attach
you
all
and
make
you
stoop
unto
the
sovereign
mercy
of
the
king
but
since
i
cannot
be
it
known
to
you
i
do
remain
as
neuter
so
fare
you
well
unless
you
please
to
enter
in
the
castle

there
repose
you
for
this
night
an
offer

thy
glory
like
a
shooting
star

to
the
base
earth
from
the
firmament
thy
sun
sets
weeping
in
the
lowly
west
witnessing
storms
to
come
woe
and
unrest

friends
are
fled

wait
upon
thy
foes

crossly
to
thy
good
all
fortune
goes
bring
forth
these
men
bushy
and
green
i
will
not
vex
your
souls
since
presently
your
souls
must
part
your
bodies
with
too
much
urging
your
pernicious
lives
for
twere
no
charity
yet
to
wash
your
blood
from
off
my
hands
here
in
the
view
of
men
i
will
unfold
some
causes
of
your
deaths
you
have
misled
a
prince
a
royal
king
a
happy
gentleman
in
blood
and
lineaments
by
you
unhappied
and
disfigurd
clean
you
have
in
manner
with
your
sinful
hours
made
a
divorce
betwixt
his
queen
and
him
broke
the
possession
of
a
royal
bed
and
staind
the
beauty
of
a
fair
queens
cheeks
with
tears
drawn
from
her
eyes
by
your
foul
wrongs
myself
a
prince
by
fortune
of
my
birth
near
to
the
king
in
blood
and
near
in
love
till
you
did
make
him
misinterpret
me
have
stoopd
my
neck
under
your
injuries
and
sighd
my
english
breath
in
foreign
clouds
eating
the
bitter
bread
of
banishment
whilst
you
have
fed
upon
my
signories
disparkd
my
parks
and
felled
my
forest
woods
from
mine
own
windows
torn
my
household
coat
razd
out
my
impress
leaving
me
no
sign
save
mens
opinions
and
my
living
blood
to
show
the
world
i
am
a
gentleman
this
and
much
more
much
more
than
twice
all
this
condemns
you
to
the
death
see
them
deliverd
over
to
execution
and
the
hand
of
death
more
welcome
is
the
stroke
of
death
to
me
than
bolingbroke
to
england
lords
farewell
my
comfort
is
that
heaven
will
take
our
souls
and
plague
injustice
with
the
pains
of
hell
my
lord
northumberland

them
dispatchd

call
they
this
at
hand
yea
my
lord
how
brooks
your
grace
the
air
after
your
late
tossing
on
the
breaking
seas
needs
must
i
like
it
well
i
weep
for
joy
to
stand
upon
my
kingdom
once
again
dear
earth
i
do
salute
thee
with
my
hand
though
rebels
wound
thee
with
their
horses
hoofs
as
a
longparted
mother
with
her
child
plays
fondly
with
her
tears
and
smiles
in
meeting
so
weeping
smiling
greet
i
thee
my
earth
and
do
thee
favour
with
my
royal
hands
feed
not
thy
sovereigns
foe
my
gentle
earth
nor
with
thy
sweets
comfort
his
revenous
sense
but
let
thy
spiders
that
suck
up
thy
venom
and
heavygaited
toads
lie
in
their
way
doing
annoyance
to
the
treacherous
feet
which
with
usurping
steps
do
trample
thee
yield
stinging
nettles
to
mine
enemies
and
when
they
from
thy
bosom
pluck
a
flower
guard
it
i
pray
thee
with
a
lurking
adder
whose
double
tongue
may
with
a
mortal
touch
throw
death
upon
thy
sovereigns
enemies
mock
not
my
senseless
conjuration
lords
this
earth
shall
have
a
feeling
and
these
stones
prove
armed
soldiers
ere
her
native
king
shall
falter
under
foul
rebellions
arms
fear
not
my
lord
that
power
that
made
you
king
hath
power
to
keep
you
king
in
spite
of
all
the
means
that
heaven
yields
must
be
embracd
and
not
neglected
else
if
heaven
would
and
we
will
not
heavens
offer
we
refuse
the
profferd
means
of
succour
and
redress
he
means
my
lord
that
we
are
too
remiss
whilst
bolingbroke
through
our
security
grows
strong
and
great
in
substance
and
in
friends
discomfortable
cousin
knowst
thou
not
that
when
the
searching
eye
of
heaven
is
hid
behind
the
globe
and
lights
the
lower
world
then
thieves
and
robbers
range
abroad
unseen
in
murders
and
in
outrage
bloody
here
but
when
from
under
this
terrestrial
ball
he
fires
the
proud
tops
of
the
eastern
pines
and
darts
his
light
through
every
guilty
hole
then
murders
treasons
and
detested
sins
the
cloak
of
night
being
pluckd
from
off
their
backs
stand
bare
and
naked
trembling
at
themselves
so
when
this
thief
this
traitor
bolingbroke
who
all
this
while
hath
revelld
in
the
night
whilst
we
were
wandering
with
the
antipodes
shall
see
us
rising
in
our
throne
the
east
his
treasons
will
sit
blushing
in
his
face
not
able
to
endure
the
sight
of
day
but
selfaffrighted
tremble
at
his
sin
not
all
the
water
in
the
rough
rude
sea
can
wash
the
balm
from
an
anointed
king
the
breath
of
worldly
men
cannot
depose
the
deputy
elected
by
the
lord
for
every
man
that
bolingbroke
hath
pressd
to
lift
shrewd
steel
against
our
golden
crown
god
for
his
richard
hath
in
heavenly
pay
a
glorious
angel
then
if
angels
fight
weak
men
must
fall
for
heaven
still
guards
the
right
welcome
my
lord
how
far
off
lies
your
power
nor
near
nor
further
off
my
gracious
lord
than
this
weak
arm
discomfort
guides
my
tongue
and
bids
me
speak
of
nothing
but
despair
one
day
too
late
i
fear
me
noble
lord

clouded
all
thy
happy
days

silver
rivers
drown
their
shores
as
if
the
world
were
all
dissolvd
to
tears
so
high
above
his
limits
swells
the
rage
of
bolingbroke
covering
your
fearful
land
with
hard
bright
steel
and
hearts
harder
than
steel
whitebeards
have
armd
their
thin
and
hairless
scalps
against

tale
so
ill
where
is
the
earl
of
wiltshire
where

that
they

such
peaceful
steps
if
we
prevail
their

shall
pay
for
it
i

they
have
made
peace
with
bolingbroke
peace
have
they
made
with

to
the
sourest
and
most
deadly
hate
again
uncurse
their
souls
their
peace
is
made
with

those
whom
you
curse
have
felt
the
worst
of
deaths
destroying
wound
and
lie
full
low
gravd
in
the
hollow
ground
is
bushy
green
and
the
earl
of
wiltshire
dead
yea
all
of
them
at
bristol
lost
their

where
is
the

my
father
with
his

no

where
of
comfort
no

lets
talk

graves
of
worms

epitaphs
make
dust
our
paper

with
rainy
eyes
write
sorrow
on
the

of

lets
choose
executors

and
yet
not
so
for
what
can
we
bequeath
save
our
deposed
bodies
to
the
ground
our
lands
our
lives
and
all
are
bolingbrokes
and
nothing
can
we
call
our
own
but
death
and
that
small
model
of
the
barren
earth
which
serves
as
paste
and
cover
to
our
bones
for
gods
sake
let
us
sit
upon
the
ground
and
tell
sad
stories
of
the
death
of
kings
how
some
have
been
deposd
some
slain
in
war
some
haunted
by
the
ghosts
they
have
deposd
some
poisond
by
their
wives
some
sleeping
killd
all
murderd
for
within
the
hollow
crown
that
rounds
the
mortal
temples
of
a
king
keeps
death
his
court
and
there
the
antick
sits
scoffing
his
state
and
grinning
at
his
pomp
allowing
him
a
breath
a
little
scene
to
monarchize
be
feard
and
kill
with
looks
infusing
him
with
self
and
vain
conceit
as
if
this
flesh
which
walls
about
our
life
were
brass
impregnable
and
humourd
thus
comes
at
the
last
and
with
a
little
pin
bores
through
his
castle
wall
and
farewell
king
cover
your
heads
and
mock
not
flesh
and
blood
with
solemn
reverence
throw
away
respect
tradition
form
and
ceremonious
duty
for
you
have
but
mistook
me
all
this
while
i
live
with
bread
like
you
feel
want
taste
grief
need
friends
subjected
thus
how
can
you
say
to
me
i
am
a
king
my
lord
wise
men
neer
sit
and
wail
their
woes
but
presently
prevent
the
ways
to
wail
to
fear
the
foe
since
fear
oppresseth
strength
gives
in
your
weakness
strength
unto
your
foe
and
so
your
follies
fight
against
yourself
fear
and
be
slain
no
worse
can
come
to
fight
and
fight
and
die
is
death
destroying
death
where
fearing
dying
pays
death
servile
breath
my
father
hath
a
power
inquire
of
him
and
learn
to
make
a

limb
thou
chidst
me
well
proud
boling
broke
i
come
to
change
blows
with
thee
for
our
day
of
doom
this
aguefit
of
fear
is
overblown
an
easy
task
it
is
to
win
our
own

scroop
where
lies
our

only
to

the
rude

of
that
ancient
castle
through
brazen

the
breath
of
parley
into
his
ruind
ears
and
thus
deliver
henry
bolingbroke
on
both
his
knees
doth
kiss
king
richards
hand
and
sends
allegiance
and
true
faith
of
heart
to
his
most
royal
person
hither
come
even
at
his
feet
to
lay
my

and
lands
restord
again
be
freely
granted
if
not
ill
use
the
advantage
of
my
power
and
lay
the
summers
dust
with
showers
of
blood
raind
from
the
wounds
of
slaughterd
englishmen
the
which
how
far
off
from
the
mind
of
bolingbroke
it
is
such
crimson
tempest
should
bedrench
the
fresh
green
lap
of
fair
king
richards
land
my
stooping
duty
tenderly
shall
show
go
signify
as
much
while
here
we
march
upon
the
grassy
carpet
of
this
plain
lets
march
without
the
noise
of
threatning
drum
that
from
the
castles
totterd
battlements
our
fair
appointments
may
be
well
perusd
methinks
king
richard
and
myself
should
meet
with
no
less
terror
than
the
elements
of
fire
and
water
when
their
thundering
shock
at
meeting
tears
the
cloudy
cheeks
of
heaven
be
he
the
fire
ill
be
the
yielding
water
the
rage
be
his
while
on
the
earth
i
rain
my
waters
on
the
earth
and
not
on
him
march
on
and
mark
king
richard
how
he
looks
see
see
king
richard
doth
himself
appear
as
doth
the
blushing
discontented
sun
from
out
the
fiery
portal
of
the
east
when
he
perceives
the
envious
clouds
are
bent
to
dim
his
glory
and
to
stain
the
track
of
his
bright
passage
to
the
occident
yet
looks
he
like
a
king
behold
his
eye
as
bright
as
is
the
eagles
lightens
forth
controlling
majesty
alack
alack
for
woe
that
any
harm
should
stain
so
fair
a
show
we
are
amazd
and
thus
long
have
we
stood
to
watch
the
fearful
bending
of
thy
knee
because
we
thought
ourself
thy
lawful
king
and
if
we
be
how
dare
thy
joints
forget
to
pay
their
awful
duty
to
our
presence
if
we
be
not
show
us
the
hand
of
god
that
hath
dismissd
us
from
our
stewardship
for
well
we
know
no
hand
of
blood
and
bone
can
gripe
the
sacred
handle
of
our
sceptre
unless
he
do
profane
steal
or
usurp
and
though
you
think
that
all
as
you
have
done
have
torn
their
souls
by
turning
them
from
us
and
we
are
barren
and
bereft
of
friends
yet
know
my
master
god
omnipotent
is
mustering
in
his
clouds
on
our
behalf
armies
of
pestilence
and
they
shall
strike
your
children
yet
unborn
and
unbegot
that
lift
your
vassal
hands
against
my
head
and
threat
the
glory
of
my
precious
crown
tell
bolingbroke
for
yond
methinks
he
is
that
every
stride
he
makes
upon
my
land
is
dangerous
treason
he
is
come
to
open
the
purple
testament
of
bleeding
war
but
ere
the
crown
he
looks
for
live
in
peace
ten
thousand
bloody
crowns
of
mothers
sons
shall
ill
become
the
flower
of

the
complexion
of
her
maidpale
peace
to
scarlet
indignation
and
bedew
her
pastures
grass
with
faithful
english
blood
the
king
of
heaven
forbid
our
lord

king
should
so
with
civil
and
uncivil
arms
be
rushd
upon
thy
thricenoble
cousin

humbly
kiss
thy
hand
and
by
the
honourable
tomb

swears
that

upon
your
royal
grandsires
bones
and
by
the
royalties
of
both
your
bloods
currents
that
spring
from
one
most
gracious
head

by
the
buried
hand
of
warlike
gaunt
and
by
the
worth
and
honour
of
himself
comprising
all
that
may
be
sworn
or
said
his
coming
hither
hath
no
further
scope
than
for
his
lineal
royalties
and
to
beg
enfranchisement
immediate
on
his
knees
which
on
thy
royal
party
granted
once
his
glittering
arms
he
will
commend
to
rust
his
barbed
steeds
to
stables
and
his
heart
to
faithful
service
of
your
majesty

play
at
bowls

think
the
world
is
full
of
rubs
and
that
my
fortune
runs
against
the
bias
madam

dance
my
legs
can
keep

in

some
other
sport
madam
well
tell
tales
of
sorrow
or
of
joy
of
either
madam
of
neither
girl
for
if
of
joy
being
altogether
wanting
it
doth
remember
me
the
more
of
sorrow
or
if
of
grief
being
altogether
had
it
adds
more
sorrow
to
my
want
of
joy
for
what
i
have
i
need
not
to
repeat
and
what
i
want
it

the
gardeners
lets
step
into
the
shadow
of
these
trees
my
wretchedness
unto
a
row
of
pins
theyll
talk
of
state
for
every
one
doth
so
against
a
change
woe
is
forerun
with
woe
go
bind
thou
up
yon
dangling
apricocks
which
like
unruly
children
make
their
sire
stoop
with
oppression
of
their
prodigal
weight
give
some
supportance
to
the
bending
twigs
go
thou
and
like
an
executioner
cut
off
the
heads
of
too
fast
growing
sprays
that
look
too
lofty
in
our
commonwealth
all
must
be
even
in
our
government
you
thus
employd
i
will
go
root
away
the
noisome
weeds
that
without
profit
suck
the
soils
fertility
from
wholesome
flowers
why
should
we
in
the
compass
of
a
pale
keep
law
and
form
and
due
proportion
showing
as
in
a
model
our
firm
estate
when
our
seawalled
garden
the
whole
land
is
full
of
weeds
her
fairest
flowers
chokd
up
her
fruittrees
all
unprund
her
hedges
ruind
her
knots
disorderd
and
her
wholesome
herbs
swarming
with
caterpillars
hold
thy
peace
he
that
hath
sufferd
this
disorderd
spring
hath
now
himself
met
with
the
fall
of
leaf
the
weeds
that
his
broadspreading
leaves
did
shelter
that
seemd
in
eating
him
to
hold
him
up
are
pluckd
up
root
and
all
by
bolingbroke
i
mean
the
earl
of
wiltshire
bushy
green
what
are
they
dead
they
are
and
bolingbroke
hath
seizd
the
wasteful
king
o
what
pity
is
it
that
he
hath
not
so
trimmd
and
dressd
his
land
as
we
this
garden
we
at
time
of
year
do
wound
the
bark
the
skin
of
our
fruittrees
lest
being
overproud
with
sap
and
blood
with
too
much
riches
it
confound
itself
had
he
done
so
to
great
and
growing
men
they
might
have
livd
to
bear
and
he
to
taste
their
fruits
of
duty
superfluous
branches
we
lop
away
that
bearing
boughs
may
live
had
he
done
so
himself
had
borne
the
crown
which
waste
of
idle
hours
hath
quite
thrown
down
what
think
you
then
the
king
shall
be
deposd
depressd
he
is
already
and
deposd
tis
doubt
he
will
be

the
mighty
hold
of
bolingbroke
their
fortunes

weighd
in
your
lords
scale

nothing
but
himself
and
some
few
vanities
that
make
him
light
but

the
balance
of
great
bolingbroke
besides
himself
are
all
the
english
peers
and
with
that
odds

that
reacheth
from
the
restful
english
court
as
far
as
calais
to
my
uncles
head
amongst
much
other
talk
that
very
time
i
heard
you
say
that
you
had
rather
refuse
the
offer
of
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
than
bolingbrokes
return
to
england
adding
withal
how
blest
this
land
would
be
in
this
your
cousins

noble
lords

thee
in
so
fair
a
troop
to
read
a
lecture
of
them
if
thou
wouldst
there
shouldst
thou
find
one
heinous
article
containing
the
deposing
of
a
king
and
cracking
the
strong
warrant
of
an
oath
markd
with
a
blot
damnd
in
the
book
of
heaven
nay
all
of
you
that
stand
and
look
upon

whilst
that
my
wretchedness
doth
bait
myself
though
some
of
you
with
pilate
wash
your
hands
showing
an
outward
pity
yet
you
pilates
have
here
deliverd
me
to
my
sour
cross
and
water
cannot
wash
away
your
sin
my
lord
dispatch
read
oer
these
articles
mine
eyes
are
full
of
tears
i
cannot
see
and
yet
salt
water
blinds
them
not
so
much
but
they
can
see
a
sort
of
traitors
here
nay
if
i
turn
mine
eyes
upon
myself
i
find
myself
a
traitor
with
the
rest
for
i
have
given
here
my
souls
consent
to
undeck
the
pompous
body
of
a

the
heavy
day
that
i
have
worn
so
many
winters
out
and
know
not
now
what
name
to
call
myself
o
that
i
were
a
mockery
king
of
snow
standing
before
the
sun
of
bolingbroke
to
melt
myself
away
in
waterdrops
good

good
an
if

what
a
face
i
have
since

go
some
of
you
and
fetch
a
lookingglass

oer
this
paper
while
the
glass
doth
come
fiend
thou
tormentst
me
ere
i
come
to

urge
it
no

my
lord
northumberland
the
commons
will
not
then
be
satisfied

shall
be
satisfied
ill
read
enough
when
i
do
see
the
very
book
indeed
where
all
my
sins
are
writ
and
thats
myself
give
me
the
glass
and
therein
will
i
read
no
deeper
wrinkles
yet
hath
sorrow
struck
so
many
blows
upon
this
face
of
mine
and
made
no
deeper
wounds
o
flattering
glass
like
to
my
followers
in
prosperity
thou
dost
beguile
me
was
this
face
the
face
that
every
day
under
his
household
roof
did
keep
ten
thousand
men
was
this
the
face
that
like
the
sun
did
make
beholders
wink
was
this
the
face
that
facd
so
many
follies
and
was
at
last
outfacd
by
bolingbroke
a
brittle
glory
shineth
in
this
face
as
brittle
as
the
glory
is
the
face
for
there
it
is
crackd
in
a
hundred
shivers
mark
silent
king
the
moral
of
this
sport
how
soon
my
sorrow
hath
destroyd
my
face
the
shadow
of
your
sorrow

destroyd
the
shadow
of
your
face

again
the
shadow
of
my
sorrow

lets
see
tis
very
true
my
grief
lies
all
within
and
these
external
manners
of
laments
are
merely
shadows
to
the
unseen
grief
that
swells
with
silence
in
the
torturd
soul
there
lies
the
substance
and
i
thank
thee
king
for
thy
great
bounty
that
not
only
givst
me
cause
to
wail
but
teachest
me
the
way
how
to
lament
the
cause

thee
in
some
religious
house

hath
bolingbroke
deposd
thine

forth
his

with
rage
to
be
oerpowerd

take
thy
correction
mildly
kiss
the
rod
and
fawn
on
rage
with
base
humility
which
art
a
lion
and
a

as
from

deathbed
my
last
living
leave
in
winters
tedious
nights
sit
by
the
fire
with
good
old
folks
and
let
them
tell
thee
tales
of
woeful
ages
long
ago
betid
and
ere
thou
bid
good
night
to
quit
their
grief
tell
thou
the
lamentable
tale
of
me
and
send
the
hearers
weeping
to
their
beds
for
why
the
senseless
brands
will
sympathize
the
heavy
accent
of
thy
moving
tongue
and
in
compassion
weep
the
fire
out
and
some
will
mourn
in
ashes
some
coalblack
for
the
deposing
of
a
rightful
king
my
lord
the
mind
of
bolingbroke
is
changd

break
into
corruption
thou
shalt
think
though
he
divide
the
realm
and
give
thee
half
it
is
too
little
helping
him
to
all
and
he
shall
think
that
thou
which
knowst
the
way
to
plant
unrightful
kings
wilt
know
again
being
neer
so
little
urgd
another
way
to
pluck
him
headlong
from
the
usurped
throne
the
love
of
wicked
friends
converts
to
fear
that
fear
to
hate
and
hate
turns
one
or
both
to
worthy
danger
and

my
love
and
heart
from

this
fond
delay
once
more
adieu
the
rest
let
sorrow
say
my
lord
you
told
me
you
would
tell
the
rest
when
weeping
made
you
break
the
story
off
of
our
two
cousins
coming
into
london
where
did
i
leave
at
that
sad
stop
my
lord
where
rude
misgovernd
hands
from
windows
tops
threw
dust
and
rubbish
on
king
richards
head
then
as
i
said
the
duke
great
bolingbroke
mounted
upon
a
hot
and
fiery
steed
which
his
aspiring
rider
seemd
to
know
with
slow
but
stately
pace
kept
on
his
course
while
all
tongues
cried
god
save
thee
bolingbroke
you
would
have
thought
the
very
windows
spake
so
many
greedy
looks
of
young
and
old
through
casements
darted
their
desiring
eyes
upon
his
visage
and
that
all
the
walls
with
painted
imagery
had
said
at
once
jesu
preserve
thee
welcome
bolingbroke
whilst
he
from
one
side
to
the
other
turning
bareheaded
lower
than
his
proud
steeds
neck
bespake
them
thus
i
thank
you
countrymen
and
thus
still
doing
thus
he
passd
along
alack
poor
richard
where
rode
he
the
whilst
as
in
a
theatre
the
eyes
of
men
after
a
wellgracd
actor
leaves
the
stage
are
idly
bent
on
him
that
enters
next
thinking
his
prattle
to
be
tedious
even
so
or
with
much
more
contempt
mens
eyes
did
scowl
on
richard
no
man
cried
god
save
him
no
joyful
tongue
gave
him
his
welcome
home
but
dust
was
thrown
upon
his
sacred
head
which
with
such
gentle
sorrow
he
shook
off
his
face
still
combating
with
tears
and
smiles
the
badges
of
his
grief
and
patience
that
had
not
god
for
some
strong
purpose
steeld
the
hearts
of
men
they
must
perforce
have
melted
and
barbarism
itself
have
pitied
him
but
heaven
hath
a
hand
in
these
events
to
whose
high
will
we
bound
our
calm
contents
to
bolingbroke

we
sworn
subjects

accuse
thee
ill
not

ground
till

have
pardond
thee
away
be
gone
can
no
man
tell
of
my
unthrifty
son
tis
full
three
months
since
i
did
see
him
last
if
any
plague
hang
over
us
tis
he
i
would
to
god
my
lords
he
might
be
found
inquire
at
london
mongst
the
taverns
there
for
there
they
say
he
daily
doth
frequent
with
unrestrained
loose
companions
even
such
they
say
as
stand
in
narrow
lanes
and
beat
our
watch
and
rob
our
passengers
while
he
young
wanton
and
effeminate
boy
takes
on
the
point
of
honour
to
support
so
dissolute
a
crew
my
lord
some
two
days
since
i
saw
the
prince
and
told
him
of
these
triumphs
held
at
oxford
and
what
said
the
gallant
his
answer
was
he
would
unto
the
stews
and
from
the
commonst
creature
pluck
a
glove
and
wear
it
as
a
favour
and
with
that
he
would
unhorse
the
lustiest
challenger
as
dissolute
as
desperate
yet
through
both
i
see
some
sparkles
of
a
better
hope
which
elder
days
may
happily
bring
forth
but
who
comes
here
where
is
the
king
what
means
our
cousin
that
he
stares
and
looks
so
wildly
god
save
your
grace
i
do
beseech
your
majesty
to
have
some
conference
with
your
grace
alone
withdraw
yourselves
and
leave
us
here
alone
what
is
the
matter
with
our
cousin
now
for
ever
may
my
knees
grow
to
the
earth
my
tongue
cleave
to
my
roof
within
my
mouth
unless
a
pardon
ere
i
rise
or
speak
intended
or
committed
was
this
fault
if
on
the
first
how
heinous
eer
it
be
to
win
thy
afterlove
i
pardon
thee
then
give
me

never
longd
to
hear
a
word
till
now
say
pardon
king
let
pity
teach
thee
how
the
word
is
short
but
not
so
short
as
sweet
no
word
like
pardon
for
kings
mouths
so
meet
speak
it
in
french
king
say
pardonnez
moy
dost
thou
teach
pardon
pardon
to
destroy
ah
my
sour
husband
my
hardhearted
lord
that
settst
the
word
itself
against
the
word
speak
pardon
as
tis
current
in
our
land
the
chopping
french
we
do
not
understand
thine
eye
begins
to
speak
set
thy
tongue
there
or
in
thy
piteous
heart
plant
thou
thine
ear
that
hearing
how
our
plants
and
prayers
do
pierce
pity
may
move
thee
pardon
to
rehearse
good
aunt
stand
up
i
do
not
sue
to
stand
pardon
is
all
the
suit
i
have
in
hand
i
pardon
him
as
god
shall
pardon
me
o
happy
vantage
of
a
kneeling
knee
yet
am
i
sick
for
fear
speak
it
again
twice
saying
pardon
doth
not
pardon
twain
but
makes
one
pardon
strong
with
all
my
heart
i
pardon
him
a
god
on
earth
thou
art
but
for
our
trusty
brotherinlaw
and
the
abbot
with
all
the
rest
of
that
consorted
crew
destruction
straight
shall
dog
them
at
the
heels
good
uncle
help
to
order
several
powers
to
oxford
or
whereer
these
traitors
are
they
shall
not
live
within
this
world
i
swear
but
i
will
have
them
if
i
once
know
where
uncle
farewell
and
cousin
too
adieu
your
mother
well
hath
prayd
and
prove
you
true
come
my
old
son
i
pray
god
make
thee
new
didst
thou
not
mark
the
king
what
words
he
spake
have
i
no
friend
will
rid
me
of
this
living
fear
was
it
not
so
those
were
his
very
words
have
i
no
friend
quoth
he
he
spake
it
twice
and
urgd
it
twice
together
did
he
not
he
did
and
speaking
it
he
wistly
looked
on
me
as
who
should
say
i
would
thou
wert
the
man
that
would
divorce
this
terror
from
my
heart
meaning
the
king
at
pomfret
come
lets
go
i
am
the
kings
friend
and
will
rid
his
foe
i
have
been
studying
how
i
may
compare
this
prison
where
i
live
unto
the
world
and
for
because
the
world
is
populous
and
here
is
not
a
creature
but
myself
i
cannot
do
it
yet
ill
hammer
it
out
my
brain
ill
prove
the
female
to
my
soul
my
soul
the
father
and
these
two
beget
a
generation
of
stillbreeding
thoughts
and
these
same
thoughts
people
this
little
world
in
humours
like
the
people
of
this
world
for
no
thought
is
contented
the
better
sort
as
thoughts
of
things
divine
are
intermixd
with
scruples
and
do
set
the
word
itself
against
the
word
as
thus
come
little
ones
and
then
again
it
is
as
hard
to
come
as
for
a
camel
to
thread
the
postern
of
a
needles
eye
thoughts
tending
to
ambition
they
do
plot
unlikely
wonders
how
these
vain
weak
nails
may
tear
a
passage
through
the
flinty
ribs
of
this
hard
world
my
ragged
prison
walls
and
for
they
cannot
die
in
their
own
pride
thoughts
tending
to
content
flatter
themselves
that
they
are
not
the
first
of
fortunes
slaves
nor
shall
not
be
the
last
like
silly
beggars
who
sitting
in
the
stocks
refuge
their
shame
that
many
have
and
others
must
sit
there
and
in
this
thought
they
find
a
kind
of
ease
bearing
their
own
misfortune
on
the
back
of
such
as
have
before
endurd
the
like
thus
play
i
in
one
person
many
people
and
none
contented
sometimes
am
i
king
then
treason
makes
me
wish
myself
a
beggar
and
so
i
am
then
crushing
penury
persuades
me
i
was
better
when
a
king
then
am
i
kingd
again
and
by
and
by
think
that
i
am
unkingd
by
bolingbroke
and
straight
am
nothing
but
whateer
i
be
nor
i
nor
any
man
that

shall
be

music

how
sour
sweet

is
when

and
no

so
is
it
in
the
music
of

and
here

i
the
daintiness
of

to

broke
in

for
the

an

my
true

i

waste
me
for
now
hath
time
made
me
his

clock
my
thoughts
are
minutes
and
with
sighs
they
jar
their
watches
on
unto
mine
eyes
the
outward
watch
whereto
my
finger
like
a
dials
point
is
pointing
still
in
cleansing
them
from
tears
now
sir
the
sound
that
tells
what
hour
it
is
are
clamorous
groans
that
strike
upon
my
heart
which
is
the
bell
so
sighs
and
tears
and
groans
show
minutes
times
and
hours
but
my
time
runs
posting
on
in

proud
joy
while
i

fooling
here
his

this
music
mads
me
let

made
him
proud
with

for
that

black
incontinent
ill
make
a
voyage
to
the
holy
land
to
wash
this
blood
off
from
my
guilty
hand
march
sadly
after
grace
my
mournings
here
in
weeping
after
this
untimely
bier
the
tragedy
of
king
richard
iii
now
is
the
winter
of
our
discontent
made
glorious
summer
by
this
sun
of
york
and
all
the
clouds
that
lourd
upon
our
house
in
the
deep
bosom
of
the
ocean
buried
now
are
our
brows
bound
with
victorious
wreaths
our
bruised
arms
hung
up
for
monuments
our
stern
alarums
changed
to
merry
meetings
our
dreadful
marches
to
delightful
measures
grimvisagd
war
hath
smoothd
his
wrinkled
front
and
now
instead
of
mounting
barbed
steeds
to
fright
the
souls
of
fearful
adversaries
he
capers
nimbly
in
a
ladys
chamber
to
the
lascivious
pleasing
of
a
lute
but
i
that
am
not
shapd
for
sportive
tricks
nor
made
to
court
an
amorous
lookingglass
i
that
am
rudely
stampd
and
want
loves
majesty
to
strut
before
a
wanton
ambling
nymph
i
that
am
curtaild
of
this
fair
proportion
cheated
of
feature
by
dissembling
nature
deformd
unfinishd
sent
before
my
time
into
this
breathing
world
scarce
half
made
up
and
that
so
lamely
and
unfashionable
that
dogs
bark
at
me
as
i
halt
by
them
why
i
in
this
weak
piping
time
of
peace
have
no
delight
to
pass
away
the
time
unless
to
see
my
shadow
in
the
sun
and
descant
on
mine
own
deformity
and
therefore
since
i
cannot
prove
a
lover
to
entertain
these
fair
wellspoken
days
i
am
determined
to
prove
a
villain
and
hate
the
idle
pleasures
of
these
days
plots
have
i
laid
inductions
dangerous
by
drunken
prophecies
libels
and
dreams
to
set
my
brother
clarence
and
the
king
in
deadly
hate
the
one
against
the
other
and
if
king
edward
be
as
true
and
just
as
i
am
subtle
false
and
treacherous
this
day
should
clarence
closely
be
mewd
up
about
a
prophecy
which
says
that
g
of
edwards
heirs
the
murderer
shall
be
dive
thoughts
down
to
my
soul
here
clarence
comes
brother
good
day
what
means
this
armed
guard
that
waits
upon
your
grace
his
majesty
tendering
my
persons
safety
hath
appointed
this
conduct
to
convey
me
to
the
tower
upon
what
cause
because
my
name
is
george
alack
my
lord
that
fault
is
none
of
yours
he
should
for
that
commit
your
godfathers
o
belike
his
majesty
hath
some
intent
that
you
should
be
newchristend
in
the
tower
but
whats
the
matter
clarence
may
i
know
yea
richard
when
i
know
for
i
protest
as
yet
i
do
not
but
as
i
can
learn
he
hearkens
after
prophecies
and
dreams
and
from
the
crossrow
plucks
the
letter
g
and
says
a
wizard
told
him
that
by
g
his
issue
disinherited
should
be
and
for
my
name
of
george
begins
with
g
it
follows
in
his
thought
that
i
am
he
these
as
i
learn
and
such
like
toys
as
these
have
movd
his
highness
to
commit
me
now
why
this
it
is
when
men
are
ruld
by
women
tis
not
the
king
that
sends
you
to
the
tower
my
lady
grey
his
wife
clarence
tis
she
that
tempers
him
to
this
extremity
was
it
not
she
and
that
good
man
of
worship
antony
woodville
her
brother
there
that
made
him
send
lord
hastings
to
the
tower
from
whence
this
present
day
he
is
deliverd
we
are
not
safe
clarence
we
are
not
safe
by
heaven
i
think
there
is
no
man
secure
but
the
queens

nightwalking
heralds
that
trudge
betwixt
the
king
and
mistress
shore
heard

not
what
a
humble
suppliant
lord

his
delivery
humbly
complaining
to
her
deity

my
lord
chamberlain
his
liberty
ill
tell
you
what
i
think
it
is
our
way
if
we
will
keep
in
favour
with
the
king
to
be
her
men
and
wear
her
livery
the
jealous
oerworn
widow
and
herself
since
that
our
brother
dubbd
them
gentlewomen
are
mighty
gossips
in
our
monarchy
i
beseech
your
graces
both
to
pardon
me
his
majesty
hath
straitly
given
in
charge
that
no
man
shall
have
private
conference
of
what
degree
soever
with
your
brother
even
so
an
please
your
worship

may
partake
of
anything
we
say

speak
no
treason
man

say
the
king
is
wise
and
virtuous
and
his
noble
queen
well
struck
in
years
fair
and
not
jealous
we
say
that
shores
wife
hath
a
pretty
foot
a
cherry
lip
a
bonny
eye
a
passing
pleasing
tongue
and
that
the
queens
kindred
are
made
gentlefolks
how
say
you
sir
can
you
deny
all
this
with
this
my
lord
myself
have
nought
to
do
naught
to
do
with
mistress
shore
i
tell
thee

it
secretly
alone

one
my
lord
her
husband
knave
wouldst
thou
betray
me
i
beseech
your
grace
to
pardon
me
and
withal
forbear
your
conference
with
the
noble
duke

know
thy
charge

the
cause
of

and
so

for
they
that
were
your
enemies

his
and
have
prevaild
as
much
on

as

be
mewd
while
kites
and
buzzards
prey
at
liberty
what
news
abroad
no
news
so
bad
abroad
as
this
at
home
the
king
is
sickly
weak
and
melancholy
and
his
physicians
fear
him
mightily
now
by
saint
paul
this
news
is
bad
indeed
o
he
hath
kept
an
evil
diet
long
and
overmuch
consumd
his
royal
person
tis
very
grievous
to
be
thought
upon
what
is
he
in
his
bed
he
is
go
you
before
and
i
will
follow
you
he
cannot
live
i
hope
and
must
not
die
till

up
to
heaven
ill
in
to
urge
his
hatred
more
to

steeld
with
weighty
arguments
and
if
i
fail
not
in
my
deep
intent
clarence

another
day
to
live
which
done
god
take
king
edward

youngest
daughter
what
though
i
killd
her
husband
and
her
father
the
readiest
way
to
make
the
wench
amends
is
to
become
her
husband
and
her
father
the
which
will
i
not
all
so
much
for
love
as
for
another
secret
close
intent
by
marrying
her
which
i
must
reach
unto
but
yet
i
run
before
my
horse
to
market
clarence
still
breathes

thou
lump
of
foul

tis
thy
presence
that
exhales
this

from
cold
and

no
law
of

no
beast
so
fierce
but
knows
some
touch
of
pity
but
i
know
none
and
therefore
am
no
beast
o
wonderful
when
devils
tell
the
truth
more
wonderful
when
angels
are
so
angry
vouchsafe
divine
perfection
of
a
woman
of
these
supposed
evils
to
give
me
leave
by
circumstance
but
to
acquit
myself
vouchsafe
diffusd
infection
of
a
man
for
these
known
evils
but
to
give
me
leave
by
circumstance
to
curse
thy
cursed
self
fairer
than
tongue
can
name
thee
let
me
have
some
patient
leisure
to
excuse
myself
fouler
than
heart
can
think
thee
thou
canst
make
no
excuse
current
but
to
hang
thyself
by
such
despair
i
should
accuse
myself
and
by
despairing
shouldst
thou
stand
excusd
for
doing
worthy
vengeance
on
thyself
which
didst
unworthy
slaughter
upon
others
say
that
i
slew
them
not
then
say
they
were
not
slain
but
dead
they
are
and
devilish
slave
by
thee
i
did
not
kill
your
husband
why
then
he
is
alive
nay
he
is
dead
and
slain
by
edwards
hand
in
thy
foul
throat
thou
liest
queen
margaret
saw
thy
murderous
falchion
smoking
in
his
blood
the
which
thou
once
didst
bend
against
her
breast
but
that
thy
brothers
beat
aside
the
point
i
was
provoked
by
her
slandrous
tongue
that
laid
their
guilt
upon
my
guiltless
shoulders
thou
wast
provoked
by
thy
bloody
mind
that
never
dreamt
on
aught
but
butcheries
didst
thou
not
kill
this
king
i
grant
ye
dost
grant
me
hedgehog
then
god
grant
me
too
thou
mayst
be
damned
for
that
wicked
deed
o
he
was
gentle
mild
and
virtuous
the
fitter
for
the
king
of
heaven
that
hath
him
he
is
in
heaven
where
thou
shalt
never
come
let
him
thank
me
that
helpd
to
send
him
thither
for
he
was
fitter
for
that
place
than
earth
and
thou
unfit
for
any
place
but
hell
yes
one
place
else
if
you
will
bear
me
name
it
some
dungeon
your
bedchamber
ill
rest
betide
the
chamber
where
thou
liest
so
will
it
madam
till
i
lie
with
you
i
hope
so
i
know
so
but
gentle
lady
anne
to
leave
this
keen
encounter
of
our
wits
and
fall
somewhat
into
a
slower
method
is
not
the
causer
of
the
timeless
deaths
of
these
plantagenets
henry
and
edward
as
blameful
as
the
executioner
thou
wast
the
cause
and
most
accursd
effect
your
beauty
was
the
cause
of
that
effect
your
beauty
that
did
haunt
me
in
my
sleep
to
undertake
the
death
of
all
the
world
so
might
i
live
one
hour
in
your
sweet
bosom
if
i
thought
that
i
tell
thee
homicide
these
nails
should
rend
that
beauty
from
my
cheeks
these
eyes
could
not
endure
that
beautys
wrack
you
should
not
blemish
it
if
i
stood
by
as
all
the
world
is
cheered
by
the
sun
so
i
by
that
it
is
my
day
my
life
black
night
oershade
thy
day
and
death
thy
life
curse
not
thyself
fair
creature
thou
art
both
i
would
i
were
to
be
revengd
on
thee
it
is
a
quarrel
most
unnatural
to
be
revengd
on
him
that
loveth
thee
it
is
a
quarrel
just
and
reasonable
to
be
revengd
on
him
that
killd
my
husband
he
that
bereft
thee
lady
of
thy
husband
did
it
to
help
thee
to
a
better
husband
his
better
doth
not
breathe
upon
the
earth
he
lives
that
loves
thee
better
than
he
could
name
him
plantagenet
why
that
was
he
the
selfsame
name
but
one
of
better
nature
where
is
he
here
why
dost
thou
spit
at
me
would
it
were
mortal
poison
for
thy
sake
never
came
poison
from
so
sweet
a
place
never
hung
poison
on
a
fouler
toad
out
of
my
sight
thou
dost
infect
mine
eyes
thine
eyes
sweet
lady
have
infected
mine
would
they
were
basilisks
to
strike
thee
dead
i
would
they
were
that
i
might
die
at
once
for
now
they
kill
me
with
a
living
death
those
eyes
of
thine
from
mine
have
drawn
salt
tears
shamd
their
aspects
with
store
of
childish
drops
these
eyes
which
never
shed
remorseful
tear
no
when
my
father
york
and
edward
wept
to
hear
the
piteous
moan
that
rutland
made
when
blackfacd
clifford
shook
his
sword
at
him
nor
when
thy
warlike
father
like
a
child
told
the
sad
story
of
my
fathers
death
and
twenty
times
made
pause
to
sob
and
weep
that
all
the
standersby
had
wet
their
cheeks
like
trees
bedashd
with
rain
in
that
sad
time
my
manly
eyes
did
scorn
an
humble
tear
and
what
these
sorrows
could
not
thence
exhale
thy
beauty
hath
and
made
them
blind
with
weeping
i
never
sud
to
friend
nor
enemy
my
tongue
could
never
learn
sweet
smoothing
words
but
now
thy
beauty
is
proposd
my
fee
my
proud
heart
sues
and
prompts
my
tongue
to
speak
teach
not
thy
lip
such
scorn
for
it
was
made
for
kissing
lady
not
for
such
contempt
if
thy
revengeful
heart
cannot
forgive
lo
here
i
lend
thee
this
sharppointed
sword
which
if
thou
please
to
hide
in
this
true
breast
and
let
the
soul
forth
that
adoreth
thee
i
lay
it
open
to
the
deadly
stroke
and
humbly
beg
the
death
upon
my
knee
nay
do
not
pause
for
i
did
kill
king
henry
but
twas
thy
beauty
that
provoked
me
nay
now
dispatch
twas
i
that
stabbd
young
edward
but
twas
thy
heavenly
face
that
set
me
on
take
up
the
sword
again
or
take
up
me
arise
dissembler
though
i
wish
thy
death
i
will
not
be
thy
executioner
then
bid
me
kill
myself
and
i
will
do
it
i
have
already
that
was
in
thy
rage
speak
it
again
and
even
with
the
word
this
hand
which
for
thy
love
did
kill
thy
love
shall
for
thy
love
kill
a
far
truer
love
to
both
their
deaths
shalt
thou
be
accessary
i
would
i
knew
thy
heart
tis
figurd
in
my
tongue
i
fear
me
both
are
false
then
never
man
was
true
well
well
put
up
your
sword
say
then
my
peace
is
made
that
shalt
thou
know
hereafter
but
shall
i
live
in
hope
all
men
i
hope
live
so
vouchsafe
to
wear
this
ring
to
take
is
not
to
give
look
how
my
ring
encompasseth
thy
finger
even
so
thy
breast
encloseth
my
poor
heart
wear
both
of
them
for
both
of
them
are
thine
and
if
thy
poor
devoted
servant
may
but
beg
one
favour
at
thy
gracious
hand
thou
dost
confirm
his
happiness
for
ever
what
is
it
that
it
may
please
you
leave
these
sad
designs
to
him
that
hath
most
cause
to
be
a
mourner
and
presently
repair
to
crosbyplace
where
after
i
have
solemnly
interrd
at
chertsey
monastery

noble
king
and
wet
his
grave
with
my
repentant
tears
i
will
with
all
expedient
duty

you
for
divers
unknown
reasons

this
boon

his
father
to
take
her
in
her
hearts
extremest
hate
with
curses
in
her
mouth

her
eyes
the
bleeding
witness
of
her
hatred
by
having
god
her
conscience
and
these
bars
against
me
and
nothing

to
back
my
suit

but
the
plain

all
the
world
to
nothing
ha
hath
she
forgot
already
that
brave
prince
edward
her
lord
whom
i
some
three
months
since
stabbd
in
my
angry
mood
at
tewksbury
a
sweeter
and
a
lovelier
gentleman
framd
in
the
prodigality
of
nature
young
valiant
wise
and
no
doubt
right
royal
the
spacious
world
cannot
again
afford
and
will
she
yet
abase
her
eyes
on
me
that
croppd
the
golden
prime
of
this
sweet
prince
and
made
her
widow
to
a
woeful
bed
on
me
whose
all
not
equals
edwards
moiety
on
me
that
halt
and
am
misshapen
thus
my
dukedom
to
a
beggarly
denier
i
do
mistake
my
person
all
this
while
upon
my
life
she
finds
although
i
cannot
myself
to
be
a
marvellous
proper
man
ill
be
at
charges
for
a
lookingglass
and
entertain
a
score
or
two
of
tailors
to
study
fashions
to
adorn
my
body
since
i
am
crept
in
favour
with
myself
i
will
maintain
it
with
some
little
cost
but
first
ill
turn
yon
fellow
in
his
grave
and
then
return
lamenting
to
my
love
shine
out
fair
sun
till
i
have
bought
a
glass
that
i
may
see
my
shadow
as
i
pass
have
patience
madam
theres
no
doubt
his
majesty
will
soon
recover
his
accustomd
health
in
that
you
brook
it
ill
it
makes
him
worse
therefore
for
gods
sake
entertain
good
comfort
and
cheer
his
grace
with
quick
and
merry
words
if
he
were
dead
what
would
betide
on
me
no
other
harm
but
loss
of
such
a
lord
the
loss
of
such
a
lord
includes
all
harms
the
heavens
have
blessd
you
with
a
goodly
son
to
be
your
comforter
when
he
is
gone
ah
he
is
young
and
his
minority
is
put
into
the
trust
of
richard
gloucester
a
man
that
loves
not
me
nor
none
of
you
is
it
concluded
he
shall
be
protector
it
is
determind
not
concluded
yet
but
so
it
must
be
if

king
miscarry
here

lords
of
buckingham
and
stanley
good
time
of
day

not
you
for
her
proud
arrogance
i
do
beseech

envious
slanders
of

false
accusers
or

with
her
weakness
which
i
think
proceeds
from
wayward
sickness
and
no
grounded
malice

king
today

lord
of
stanley
but
now

duke

hope
his
grace
speaks
cheerfully
god
grant
him
health
did
you
confer
with
him
ay
madam
he
desires
to
make
atonement
between
the
duke
of
gloucester
and
your
brothers
and
between
them
and
my
lord
chamberlain
and
sent
to
warn
them
to
his
royal
presence
would
all
were
well
but
that
will
never
be
i
fear
our
happiness
is
at
the
highest
they
do
me
wrong
and
i
will
not
endure
it
who
are
they
that
complain
unto
the
king
that
i
forsooth
am
stern
and
love
them
not
by
holy
paul
they
love
his
grace
but
lightly
that
fill
his
ears
with
such
dissentious
rumours
because
i
cannot
flatter
and
speak
fair
smile
in
mens
faces
smooth
deceive
and
cog
duck
with
french
nods
and
apish
courtesy
i
must
be
held
a
rancorous
enemy
cannot
a
plain
man
live
and
think
no
harm
but
thus
his
simple
truth
must
be
abusd
by
silken
sly
insinuating
jacks
to
whom
in
all
this
presence
speaks
your
grace
to
thee
that
hast
nor
honesty
nor
grace
when
have
i
injurd
thee
when
done
thee
wrong
or
thee
or
thee
or
any
of
your
faction
a
plague
upon
you
all
his
royal
person
whom
god
preserve
better
than
you
would
wish
cannot
be
quiet
scarce
a
breathingwhile
but
you
must
trouble
him
with
lewd
complaints
brother
of
gloucester
you
mistake
the
matter
the
king
on
his
own
royal
disposition
and
not
provokd
by
any
suitor
else
aiming
belike
at
your
interior
hatred
that
in
your
outward
action
shows
itself
against
my
children
brothers
and
myself
makes
him
to
send
that
thereby
he
may
gather
the
ground
of
your
illwill
and
so
remove
it
i
cannot
tell
the
world
is
grown
so
bad
that
wrens
make
prey
where
eagles
dare
not
perch
since
every
jack
became
a
gentleman
theres
many
a
gentle
person
made
a
jack
come
come
we
know
your
meaning
brother
gloucester
you
envy
my
advancement
and
my
friends
god
grant
we
never
may
have
need
of
you
meantime
god
grants
that
we
have
need
of
you
our
brother
is
imprisond
by
your
means
myself
disgracd
and
the
nobility
held
in
contempt
while
great
promotions
are
daily
given
to
ennoble
those
that
scarce
some
two
days
since
were
worth
a
noble
by
him
that
raisd
me
to
this
careful
height
from
that
contented
hap
which
i
enjoyd
i
never
did
incense
his
majesty
against
the
duke
of
clarence
but
have
been
an
earnest
advocate
to
plead
for
him
my
lord
you
do
me
shameful
injury
falsely
to
draw
me
in
these
vile
suspects

not
the
mean
of
my
lord
hastings
late
imprisonment
she
may
my
lord
for
she
may
lord

why
who
knows
not
so
she
may
do
more
sir
than
denying
that
she
may
help
you
to
many
fair
preferments
and
then
deny
her
aiding
hand
therein
and
lay
those
honours
on
your
high
deserts

any
to

you
have
all
the
vantage

her
wrong
i
was
too
hot
to
do
somebody

the

against

my
brother
now
they
believe
it
and
withal
whet
me
to
be
revengd
on

grey
but
then
i
sigh
and
with
a
piece
of
scripture
tell
them
that
god
bids
us
do
good
for
evil
and
thus
i
clothe
my
naked
villany
with
odd
old
ends
stoln
forth
of
holy
writ
and
seem
a
saint
when
most
i
play
the
devil

soft

now
my
hardy
stout
resolved
mates

you
tell
me
methought
that
i
had
broken
from
the
tower
and
was
embarkd
to
cross
to
burgundy
and
in
my
company
my
brother
gloucester
who
from
my
cabin
tempted
me
to
walk
upon
the
hatches
thence
we
lookd
toward
england
and
cited
up
a
thousand
heavy
times
during
the
wars
of
york
and
lancaster
that
had
befalln
us
as
we
pacd
along
upon
the
giddy
footing
of
the
hatches
methought
that
gloucester
stumbled
and
in
falling
struck
me
that
thought
to
stay
him
overboard
into
the
tumbling
billows
of
the
main
lord
lord
methought
what
pain
it
was
to
drown
what
dreadful
noise
of
water
in
mine
ears
what
sights
of
ugly
death
within
mine
eyes
methought
i
saw
a
thousand
fearful
wracks
a
thousand
men
that
fishes
gnawd
upon
wedges
of
gold
great
anchors
heaps
of
pearl
inestimable
stones
unvalud
jewels
all
scatterd
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
some
lay
in
dead
mens
skulls
and
in
those
holes
where
eyes
did
once
inhabit
there
were
crept
as
twere
in
scorn
of
eyes
reflecting
gems
that
wood
the
slimy
bottom
of
the
deep
and
mockd
the
dead
bones
that
lay
scatterd
by
had
you
such
leisure
in
the
time
of
death
to
gaze
upon
those
secrets
of
the
deep
methought
i
had
and
often
did
i
strive
to
yield
the
ghost
but
still
the
envious
flood
stopt
in
my
soul
and
would
not
let
it
forth
to
find
the
empty
vast
and
wandering
air
but
smotherd
it
within
my
panting
bulk
which
almost
burst
to
belch
it
in
the
sea
awakd
you
not
with
this
sore
agony
no
no
my
dream
was
lengthend
after
life
o
then
began
the
tempest
to
my
soul
i
passd
methought
the
melancholy
flood
with
that
grim
ferryman
which
poets
write
of
unto
the
kingdom
of
perpetual
night
the
first
that
there
did
greet
my
stranger
soul
was
my
great
fatherinlaw
renowned
warwick
who
cried
aloud
what
scourge
for
perjury
can
this
dark
monarchy
afford
false
clarence
and
so
he
vanishd
then
came
wandering
by
a
shadow
like
an
angel
with
bright
hair
dabbled
in
blood
and
he
shriekd
out
aloud
clarence
is
come
false
fleeting
perjurd
clarence
that
stabbd
me
in
the
field
by
tewksbury
seize
on
him
furies
take
him
unto
torment
with
that
methought
a
legion
of
foul
fiends
environd
me
and
howled
in
mine
ears
such
hideous
cries
that
with
the
very
noise
i
trembling
wakd
and
for
a
season
after
could
not
believe
but
that
i
was
in
hell
such
terrible
impression
made
my
dream
no
marvel
lord
though
it
affrighted
you
i
am
afraid
methinks
to
hear
you
tell
it
o
brakenbury
i
have
done
these
things
that
now
give
evidence
against
my
soul
for
edwards
sake
and
see
how
he
requites
me
o
god
if
my
deep
prayers
cannot
appease
thee
but
thou
wilt
be
avengd
on
my
misdeeds
yet
execute
thy
wrath
on
me
alone
o
spare
my
guiltless
wife
and
my
poor
children
i
pray
thee
gentle
keeper
stay
by
me
my
soul
is
heavy
and
i
fain
would
sleep
i
will
my
lord
god
give
your
grace
good
rest
sorrow
breaks
seasons
and
reposing
hours
makes
the
night
morning
and
the
noontide
night
princes
have
but
their
titles
for
their
glories
an
outward
honour
for
an
inward
toil
and
for
unfelt
imaginations
they
often
feel
a
world
of
restless
cares
so
that
between
their
titles
and
low
names
theres
nothing
differs
but
the
outward
fame
ho
whos
here
what
wouldst
thou
fellow
and
how
camst
thou
hither
i
would
speak
with
clarence
and
i
came
hither
on
my
legs
what
so
brief
tis
better
sir
than
to
be
tedious
let
him
see
our
commission
and
talk
no
more
i
am
in
this
commanded
to
deliver
the
noble
duke
of
clarence
to
your
hands
i
will
not
reason
what
is
meant
hereby
because
i
will
be
guiltless
of
the
meaning
there
lies
the
duke
asleep
and
there
the
keys
ill
to
the
king
and
signify
to
him
that
thus
i
have
resignd
to
you
my
charge
you
may
sir
tis
a
point
of
wisdom
fare
you
well
what
shall
we
stab
him
as
he
sleeps
no
hell
say
twas
done
cowardly
when
he
wakes
when
he
wakes
why
fool
he
shall
never
wake
till
the
judgmentday
why
then
hell
say
we
stabbed
him
sleeping
the
urging
of
that
word
judgment
hath
bred
a
kind
of
remorse
in
me
what
art
thou
afraid
not
to
kill
him
having
a
warrant
for
it
but
to
be
damnd
for
killing
him
from
the
which
no
warrant
can
defend
me
i
thought
thou
hadst
been
resolute
so
i
am
to
let
him
live
ill
back
to
the
duke
of
gloucester
and
tell
him
so
nay
i
prithee
stay
a
little
i
hope
my
holy
humour
will
change
it
was
wont
to
hold
me
but
while
one
tells
twenty
how
dost
thou
feel
thyself
now
some
certain
dregs
of
conscience
are
yet
within
me
remember
our
reward
when
the
deeds
done
zounds
he
dies
i
had
forgot
the
reward
wheres
thy
conscience
now
in
the
duke
of
gloucesters
purse
so
when
he
opens
his
purse
to
give
us
our
reward
thy
conscience
flies
out
tis
no
matter
let
it
go
theres
few
or
none
will
entertain
it
what
if
it
come
to
thee
again
ill
not
meddle
with
it
it
makes
a
man
a
coward
a
man
cannot
steal
but
it
accuseth
him
a
man
cannot
swear
but
it
checks
him
a
man
cannot
lie
with
his
neighbours
wife
but
it
detects
him
tis
a
blushing
shamefast
spirit
that
mutinies
in
a
mans
bosom
it
fills
one
full
of
obstacles
it
made
me
once
restore
a
purse
of
gold
that
i
found
it
beggars
any
man
that
keeps
it
it
is
turned
out
of
all
towns
and
cities
for
a
dangerous
thing
and
every
man
that
means
to
live
well
endeavours
to
trust
to
himself
and
live
without
it
zounds
it
is
even
now
at
my
elbow
persuading
me
not
to
kill
the
duke
take
the
devil
in
thy
mind
and
believe
him
not
he
would
insinuate
with
thee
but
to
make
thee
sigh
tut
i
am
strongframed
he
cannot
prevail
with
me
spoke
like
a
tall
fellow
that
respects
his
reputation
come
shall
we
to
this
gear
take
him
over
the
costard
with
the
hilts
of
thy
sword
and
then
throw
him
into
the
malmseybutt
in
the
next
room
o
excellent
device
make
a
sop
of
him
soft
he
wakes
strike
no
well
reason
with
him
where
art
thou
keeper
give
me
a
cup
of
wine
you
shall
have
wine
enough
my
lord
anon
in
gods
name
what
art
thou
a
man
as
you
are
but
not
as
i
am
royal
nor
you
as
we
are
loyal
thy
voice
is
thunder
but
thy
looks
are
humble
my
voice
is
now
the
kings
my
looks
mine
own
how
darkly
and
how
deadly
dost
thou
speak
your
eyes
do
menace
me
why
look
you
pale
who
sent
you
hither
wherefore
do
you
come
to
to
to
to
murder
me
ay
ay
you
scarcely
have
the
hearts
to
tell
me
so
and
therefore
cannot
have
the
hearts
to
do
it
wherein
my
friends
have
i
offended
you
offended
us
you
have
not
but
the
king
i
shall
be
reconcild
to
him
again
never
my
lord
therefore
prepare
to
die
are
you
calld
forth
from
out
a
world
of
men
to
slay
the
innocent
what
is
my
offence
where
is
the
evidence
that
doth
accuse
me
what
lawful
quest
have
given
their
verdict
up
unto
the
frowning
judge
or
who
pronouncd
the
bitter
sentence
of
poor
clarence
death
before
i
be
convict
by
course
of
law
to
threaten
me
with
death
is
most
unlawful
i
charge
you
as
you
hope
to
have
redemption
by
christs
dear
blood
shed
for
our
grievous
sins
that
you
depart
and
lay
no
hands
on
me
the
deed
you
undertake
is
damnable
what
we
will
do
we
do
upon
command
and
he
that
hath
commanded
is
our
king
erroneous
vassal
the
great
king
of
kings
hath
in
the
table
of
his
law
commanded
that
thou
shalt
do
no
murder
will
you
then
spurn
at
his
edict
and
fulfil
a
mans
take
heed
for
he
holds
vengeance
in
his
hand
to
hurl
upon
their
heads
that
break
his
law
and
that
same
vengeance
doth
he
hurl
on
thee
for
false
forswearing
and
for
murder
too
thou
didst
receive
the
sacrament
to
fight
in
quarrel
of
the
house
of
lancaster
and
like
a
traitor
to
the
name
of
god
didst
break
that
vow
and
with
thy
treacherous
blade
unrippdst
the
bowels
of
thy
sovereigns
son
whom
thou
wast
sworn
to
cherish
and
defend
how
canst
thou
urge
gods
dreadful
law
to
us
when
thou
hast
broke
it
in
such
dear
degree
alas
for
whose
sake
did
i
that
ill
deed
for
edward
for
my
brother
for
his
sake
he
sends
you
not
to
murder
me
for
this
for
in
that
sin
he
is
as
deep
as
i
if
god
will
be
avenged
for
the
deed
o
know
you
yet
he
doth
it
publicly
take
not
the
quarrel
from
his
powerful
arm
he
needs
no
indirect
or
lawless
course
to
cut
off
those
that
have
offended
him
who

bloody
minister

do
beseech
your
highness
to
take
our
brother
clarence
to
your
grace
why
madam
have
i
offerd
love
for
this
to
be
so
flouted
in
this
royal
presence
who
knows
not
that
the
gentle
duke
is
dead
you
do
him
injury
to
scorn
his
corse
who
knows
not
he
is
dead
who
knows
he
is
allseeing

what
a
world
is
this
look
i
so
pale
lord
dorset
as
the
rest
ay
my
good
lord
and
no
man
in
the
presence
but
his
red
colour
hath
forsook
his
cheeks
is
clarence
dead
the
order
was
reversd
but
he
poor
man
by
your
first
order
died
and
that
a
winged
mercury
did
bear
some
tardy
cripple
bore
the
countermand
that
came
too
lag
to
see
him
buried
god
grant
that
some
less
noble
and
less
loyal
nearer
in
bloody
thoughts
and
not
in
blood
deserve
not
worse
than
wretched
clarence
did
and
yet
go
current
from
suspicion
a
boon
my
sovreign
for
my
service
done
i
prithee
peace
my
soul
is
full
of
sorrow
i
will
not
rise
unless
your
highness
hear
me
then
say
at
once
what
is
it
thou
requestst
the
forfeit
sovereign
of
my
servants
life
who
slew
today
a
riotous
gentleman
lately
attendant
on
the
duke
of
norfolk
have
i
a
tongue
to
doom
my
brothers
death
and
shall
that
tongue
give
pardon
to
a
slave
my
brother
killd
no
man
his
fault
was
thought
and
yet
his
punishment
was
bitter
death
who
sud
to
me
for
him
who
in
my
wrath
kneeld
at
my
feet
and
bade
me
be
advisd
who
spoke
of
brotherhood
who
spoke
of
love
who
told
me
how
the
poor
soul
did
forsake
the
mighty
warwick
and
did
fight
for
me
who
told
me
in
the
field
at
tewksbury
when
oxford
had
me
down
he
rescud
me
and
said
dear
brother
live
and
be
a
king
who
told
me
when
we
both
lay
in
the
field
frozen
almost
to
death
how
he
did
lap
me
even
in
his
garments
and
did
give
himself
all
thin
and
naked
to
the
numb
cold
night
all
this
from
my
remembrance
brutish
wrath
sinfully
pluckd
and
not
a
man
of
you
had
so
much
grace
to
put
it
in
my
mind
but
when
your
carters
or
your
waitingvassals
have
done
a
drunken
slaughter
and
defacd
the
precious
image
of
our
dear
redeemer
you
straight
are
on
your
knees
for
pardon
pardon
and
i
unjustly
too
must
grant
it
you
but
for
my
brother
not
a
man
would
speak
nor
i
ungracious
speak
unto
myself
for
him
poor
soul
the
proudest
of
you
all
have
been
beholding
to
him
in
his
life
yet
none
of
you
would
once
beg
for
his
life
o
god
i
fear
thy
justice
will
take
hold
on
me
and
you
and
mine
and
yours
for
this
come
hastings
help
me
to
my
closet
o
poor

is
the
fruit
of
rashness

how
that
the
guilty
kindred
of
the
queen
lookd
pale
when
they
did
hear

god
is
much
displeasd
that
you
take
with
unthankfulness
his
doing
in
common
worldly
things
tis
calld
ungrateful
with
dull
unwillingness
to
repay
a
debt
which
with
a
bounteous
hand
was
kindly
lent
much
more
to
be
thus
opposite
with
heaven
for
it
requires
the
royal
debt
it
lent
you
madam
bethink
you
like
a
careful
mother
of
the
young
prince
your
son
send
straight
for
him
let
him
be
crownd
in
him
your
comfort
lives
drown
desperate
sorrow
in
dead
edwards
grave
and
plant
your
joys
in
living
edwards
throne
sister
have
comfort
all
of
us
have
cause
to
wail
the
dimming
of
our
shining
star
but
none
can
cure
their
harms
by
wailing
them
madam
my
mother
i
do
cry
you
mercy
i
did
not
see
your
grace
humbly
on
my
knee
i
crave
your
blessing
god
bless
thee
and
put
meekness
in
thy
mind
love
charity
obedience
and
true
duty
amen
and
make
me
die
a
good
old
man
that
is
the
buttend
of
a
mothers
blessing
i
marvel
that
her
grace
did
leave
it
out
you
cloudy
princes
and
heartsorrowing
peers
that
bear
this
heavy
mutual
load
of
moan
now
cheer
each
other
in
each
others
love
though
we
have
spent
our
harvest
of
this
king
we
are
to
reap
the
harvest
of
his
son
the
broken
rancour
of
your
highswoln
hearts
but
lately
splinterd
knit
and
joind
together
must
gently
be
preservd
cherishd
and
kept
me
seemeth
good
that
with
some
little
train
forthwith
from
ludlow
the
young
prince
be
fetchd
hither
to
london
to
be
crownd
our
king
why
with
some
little
train
my
lord
of
buckingham
marry
my
lord
lest
by
a
multitude
the
newheald
wound
of
malice
should
break
out
which
would
be
so
much
the
more
dangerous
by
how
much
the
estate
is
green
and
yet
ungovernd
where
every
horse
bears
his
commanding
rein
and
may
direct
his
course
as
please
himself
as
well
the
fear
of
harm
as
harm
apparent
in
my
opinion
ought
to
be
prevented
i
hope
the
king
made
peace
with
all
of
us
and
the
compact
is
firm
and
true
in
me
and
so
in
me
and
so
i
think
in
all
yet
since
it
is
but
green
it
should
be
put
to
no
apparent
likelihood
of
breach
which
haply
by
much
company
might
be
urgd
therefore
i
say
with
noble
buckingham
that
it
is
meet
so
few
should
fetch
the
prince
and
so
say
i
then
be
it
so
and
go
we
to
determine
who
they
shall
be
that
straight
shall
post
to
ludlow
madam
and
you
my
mother
will
you
go
to
give
your
censures
in
this
business
my
lord
whoever
journeys
to
the
prince
for
gods
sake
let
not
us
two
stay
at
home
for
by
the
way
ill
sort
occasion
as
index
to
the
story
we
late
talkd
of
to
part
the
queens
proud
kindred
from
the
prince
my
other
self
my
counsels
consistory
my
oracle
my
prophet
my
dear
cousin
i
as
a
child
will
go
by
thy
direction
towards
ludlow
then
for
well
not
stay
behind
good
morrow
neighbour
whither
away
so
fast
i
promise
you
i
scarcely
know
myself
hear
you
the
news
abroad
ay
that
the
king
is
dead
ill
news
byr
lady
seldom
comes
the
better
i
fear
i
fear
twill
prove
a
giddy
world
neighbours
god
speed
give
you
good
morrow
sir
doth
the
news
hold
of
good
king
edwards
death
ay
sir
it
is
too
true
god
help
the
while
then
masters
look
to
see
a
troublous
world
no
no
by
gods
good
grace
his
son
shall
reign
woe
to
that
land
thats
governd
by
a
child
in
him
there
is
a
hope
of
government
that
in
his
nonage
council
under
him
and
in
his
full
and
ripend
years
himself
no
doubt
shall
then
and
till
then
govern
well
so
stood
the
state
when
henry
the
sixth
was
crownd
at
paris
but
at
nine
months
old
stood
the
state
so
no
no
good
friends
god
wot
for
then
this
land
was
famously
enrichd
with
politic
grave
counsel
then
the
king
had
virtuous
uncles
to
protect
his
grace
why
so
hath
this
both
by
his
father
and
mother
better
it
were
they
all
came
by
his
father
or
by
his
father
there
were
none
at
all
for
emulation
who
shall
now
be
nearest
will
touch
us
all
too
near
if
god
prevent
not
o
full
of
danger
is
the
duke
of
gloucester
and
the
queens
sons
and
brothers
haught
and
proud
and
were
they
to
be
ruld
and
not
to
rule
this
sickly
land
might
solace
as
before
come
come
we
fear
the
worst
all
will
be
well
when
clouds
are
seen
wise
men
put
on
their
cloaks
when
great
leaves
fall
then
winter
is
at
hand
when
the
sun
sets
who
doth
not
look
for
night
untimely
storms
make
men
expect
a
dearth
all
may
be
well
but
if
god
sort
it
so
tis
more
than
we
deserve
or
i
expect
truly
the
hearts
of
men
are
full
of
fear
you
cannot
reason
almost
with
a
man
that
looks
not
heavily
and
full
of
dread
before
the
days
of
change
still
is
it
so
by
a
divine
instinct
mens
minds
mistrust
ensuing
danger
as
by
proof
we
see
the
waters
swell
before
a
boisterous
storm
but
leave
it
all
to
god
whither
away
marry
we
were
sent
for
to
the
justices
and
so
was
i
ill
bear
you
company
last
night
i
hear
they
lay
at
northampton
at
stonystratford
they
do
rest
tonight
tomorrow
or
next
day
they
will
be
here
i
long
with
all
my
heart
to
see
the
prince
i
hope
he
is
much
grown
since
last
i
saw
him
but
i
hear
no
they
say
my
son
of
york
hath
almost
overtaen
him
in
his
growth
ay
mother
but
i
would
not
have
it
so
why
my
young
cousin
it
is
good
to
grow
grandam
one
night
as
we
did
sit
at
supper
my
uncle
rivers
talkd
how
i
did
grow
more
than
my
brother
ay
quoth
my
uncle
gloucester
small
herbs
have
grace
great
weeds
do
grow
apace
and
since
methinks
i
would
not
grow
so
fast
because
sweet
flowers
are
slow
and
weeds
make
haste
good
faith
good
faith
the
saying
did
not
hold
in
him
that
did
object
the
same
to
thee
he
was
the
wretchedst
thing
when
he
was
young
so
long
agrowing
and
so
leisurely
that
if
his
rule
were
true
he
should
be
gracious
and
so
no
doubt
he
is
my
gracious
madam
i
hope
he
is
but
yet
let
mothers
doubt
now
by
my
troth
if
i
had
been
rememberd
i
could
have
given
my
uncles
grace
a
flout
to
touch
his
growth
nearer
than
he
touchd
mine
how
my
young
york
i
prithee
let
me
hear
it
marry
they
say
my
uncle
grew
so
fast
that
he
could
gnaw
a
crust
at
two
hours
old
twas
full
two
years
ere
i
could
get
a
tooth
grandam
this
would
have
been
a
biting
jest
i
prithee
pretty
york
who
told
thee
this
grandam
his
nurse
his
nurse
why
she
was
dead
ere
thou
wast
born

cannot

sweet
prince
to
london
to
your
chamber
welcome
dear
cousin
my
thoughts
sovereign
the
weary
way
hath
made
you
melancholy
no
uncle
but
our
crosses
on
the
way
have
made
it
tedious
wearisome
and
heavy
i
want
more
uncles
here
to
welcome
me
sweet
prince
the
untainted
virtue
of
your
years
hath
not
yet
divd
into
the
worlds
deceit
no
more
can
you
distinguish
of
a
man
than
of
his
outward
show
which
god
he
knows
seldom
or
never
jumpeth
with
the
heart
those
uncles
which
you
want
were
dangerous
your
grace
attended
to
their
sugard
words
but
lookd
not
on
the
poison
of
their
hearts
god
keep
you
from
them
and
from
such
false
friends
god
keep
me
from
false
friends
but
they
were
none
my
lord
the
mayor
of
london
comes
to
greet
you
god
bless
your
grace
with
health
and
happy
days
i
thank
you
good
my
lord
and
thank
you
all
i
thought
my
mother
and
my
brother
york
would
long
ere
this
have
met
us
on
the
way
fie
what
a
slug
is
hastings
that
he
comes
not
to
tell
us
whether
they
will
come
or
no
and
in
good
time
here
comes
the
sweating
lord
welcome
my
lord
what
will
our
mother
come
on
what
occasion
god
he
knows
not
i
the
queen
your
mother
and
your
brother
york
have
taken
sanctuary
the
tender
prince
would
fain
have
come
with
me
to
meet
your
grace
but
by
his
mother
was
perforce
withheld
fie
what
an
indirect
and
peevish
course
is
this
of
hers
lord
cardinal
will
your
grace
persuade
the
queen
to
send
the
duke
of
york
unto
his
princely
brother
presently
if
she
deny
lord
hastings
go
with
him
and
from
her
jealous
arms
pluck
him
perforce
my
lord
of
buckingham
if
my
weak
oratory
can
from
his
mother
win
the
duke
of
york
anon
expect
him
here
but
if
she
be
obdurate
to
mild
entreaties
god
in
heaven
forbid
we
should
infringe
the
holy
privilege
of
blessed
sanctuary
not
for
all
this
land
would
i
be
guilty
of
so
great
a
sin
you
are
too
senselessobstinate
my
lord
too
ceremonious
and
traditional
weigh
it
but
with
the
grossness
of
this
age
you
break
not
sanctuary
in
seizing
him
the
benefit
thereof
is
always
granted
to
those
whose
dealings
have
deservd
the
place
and
those
who
have
the
wit
to
claim
the
place
this
prince
hath
neither
claimd
it
nor
deservd
it
and
therefore
in
mine
opinion
cannot
have
it
then
taking
him
from
thence
that
is
not
there
you
break
no
privilege
nor
charter
there
oft
have
i
heard
of
sanctuary
men
but
sanctuary
children
neer
till
now
my
lord
you
shall
oerrule
my
mind
for
once
come
on
lord
hastings
will
you
go
with
me
i
go
my
lord
good
lords
make
all
the
speedy
haste
you
may
say
uncle
gloucester
if
our
brother
come
where
shall
we
sojourn
till
our
coronation
where
it
seems
best
unto
your
royal
self
if
i
may
counsel
you
some
day
or
two
your
highness
shall
repose
you
at
the
tower
then
where
you
please
and
shall
be
thought
most
fit
for
your
best
health
and
recreation
i
do
not
like
the
tower
of
any
place
did
julius
c
sar
build
that
place
my
lord
he
did
my
gracious
lord
begin
that
place
which
since
succeeding
ages
have
reedified
is
it
upon
record
or
else
reported
successively
from
age
to
age
he
built
it
upon
record
my
gracious
lord
but
say
my
lord
it
were
not
registerd
methinks
the
truth
should
live
from
age
to
age
as
twere
retaild
to
all
posterity
even
to
the
general
allending
day
so
wise
so
young
they
say
do
never
live
long
what
say
you
uncle
i
say
without
characters
fame
lives
long
thus
like
the
formal
vice
iniquity
i
moralize
two
meanings
in
one
word
that
julius
c
sar
was
a
famous
man
with
what
his
valour
did
enrich
his
wit
his
wit
set
down
to
make
his
valour
live
death
makes
no
conquest
of
this
conqueror
for
now
he
lives
in
fame
though
not
in
life
ill
tell
you
what
my
cousin
buckingham
what
my
gracious
lord
an
if
i
live
until
i
be
a
man
ill
win
our
ancient
right
in
france
again
or
die
a
soldier
as
i
livd
a
king
short
summers
lightly
have
a
forward
spring
now
in
good
time
here
comes
the
duke
of
york
richard
of
york
how
fares
our
loving
brother
well
my
dread
lord
so
must
i
call
you
now
ay
brother
to
our
grief
as
it
is
yours
too
late
he
died
that
might
have
kept
that
title
which
by
his
death
hath
lost
much
majesty
how
fares
our
cousin
noble
lord
of
york
i
thank
you
gentle
uncle
o
my
lord
you
said
that
idle
weeds
are
fast
in
growth
the
prince
my
brother
hath
outgrown
me
far
he
hath
my
lord
and
therefore
is
he
idle
o
my
fair
cousin
i
must
not
say
so
then
he
is
more
beholding
to
you
than
i
he
may
command
me
as
my
sovereign
but
you
have
power
in
me
as
in
a
kinsman
i
pray
you
uncle
give
me
this
dagger
my
dagger
little
cousin
with
all
my
heart
a
beggar
brother
of
my
kind
uncle
that
i
know
will
give
and
being
but
a
toy
which
is
no
grief
to
give
a
greater
gift
than
that
ill
give
my
cousin
a
greater
gift
o
thats
the
sword
to
it
ay
gentle
cousin
were
it
light
enough
o
then
i
see
youll
part
but
with
light
gifts
in
weightier
things
youll
say
a
beggar
nay
it
is
too
weighty
for
your
grace
to
wear
i
weigh
it
lightly
were
it
heavier
what
would
you
have
my
weapon
little
lord
i
would
that
i
might
thank
you
as
you
call
me
how
little
my
lord
of
york
will
still
be
cross
in
talk
uncle
your
grace
knows
how
to
bear
with
him
you
mean
to
bear
me
not
to
bear
with
me
uncle
my
brother
mocks
both
you
and
me
because
that
i
am
little
like
an
ape
he
thinks
that
you
should
bear
me
on
your
shoulders
with
what
a
sharp
provided
with
he
reasons
to
mitigate
the
scorn
he
gives
his
uncle
he
prettily
and
aptly
taunts
himself
so
cunning
and
so
young
is
wonderful
my
lord
willt
please
you
pass
along
myself
and
my
good
cousin
buckingham
will
to
your
mother
to
entreat
of
her

the
tower
and

you
go
unto
the
tower

lord

lord
protector

in
quiet
at
the
tower

would
you
fear
marry
my
uncle
clarence
angry
ghost
my
grandam
told
me
he
was
murderd
there
i
fear
no
uncles
dead
nor
none
that
live
i
hope
an
if
they

i
hope
i

not
fear
but
come
my
lord
and
with
a
heavy
heart
thinking
on
them
go
i
unto
the
tower

thou

our
reasons
urgd
upon
the
way
what
thinkst
thou
is
it
not
an
easy
matter
to

william
lord
hastings
of
our
mind
for
the
instalment
of
this
noble
duke
in
the
seat
royal
of
this
famous
isle
he
for
his
fathers
sake
so
loves
the
prince
that
he
will
not
be
won

our
reasons

the
moveables
whereof
the
king

promise
at
your
graces
hand
and
look
to
have
it
yielded
with
all
kindness
come
let
us
sup
betimes
that
afterwards
we
may
digest
our
complots
in
some
form
my
lord
my
lord
who
knocks
one
from
the
lord
stanley
what
ist
oclock
upon
the
stroke
of
four
cannot
my
lord
stanley
sleep
these
tedious
nights
so
it
appears
by
that
i
have
to
say
first
he
commends
him
to
your
noble
self
what
then
then
certifies
your
lordship
that
this
night
he
dreamt
the
boar
had
razed
off
his
helm
besides
he
says
there
are
two
councils
held
and
that
may
be
determind
at
the
one
which
may
make
you
and
him
to
rue
at
the
other
therefore
he
sends
to
know
your
lordships
pleasure
if
you
will
presently
take
horse
with
him
and
with
all
speed
post
with
him
towards
the
north
to
shun
the
danger
that
his
soul
divines
go
fellow
go
return
unto
thy
lord
bid
him
not
fear
the
separated
councils
his
honour
and
myself
are
at
the
one
and
at
the
other
is
my
good
friend
catesby
where
nothing
can
proceed
that
toucheth
us
whereof
i
shall
not
have
intelligence
tell
him
his
fears
are
shallow
wanting
instance
and
for
his
dreams
i
wonder
hes
so
fond
to
trust
the
mockery
of
unquiet
slumbers
to
fly
the
boar
before
the
boar
pursues
were
to
incense
the
boar
to
follow
us
and
make
pursuit
where
he
did
mean
no
chase
go
bid
thy
master
rise
and
come
to
me
and
we
will
both
together
to
the
tower
where
he
shall
see
the
boar
will
use
us
kindly
ill
go
my
lord
and
tell
him
what
you
say
many
good
morrows
to
my
noble
lord
good
morrow
catesby
you
are
early
stirring
what
news
what
news
in
this
our
tottering
state
it
is
a
reeling
world
indeed
my
lord
and
i
believe
will
never
stand
upright
till
richard
wear
the
garland
of
the
realm
how
wear
the
garland
dost
thou
mean
the
crown
ay
my
good
lord
ill
have
this
crown
of
mine
cut
from
my
shoulders
before
ill
see
the
crown
so
foul
misplacd
but
canst
thou
guess
that
he
doth
aim
at
it
ay
on
my
life
and
hopes
to
find
you
forward
upon
his
party
for
the
gain
thereof
and
thereupon
he
sends
you
this
good
news
that
this
same
very
day
your
enemies
the
kindred
of
the
queen
must
die
at
pomfret
indeed
i
am
no
mourner
for
that
news
because
they
have
been
still
my
adversaries
but
that
ill
give
my
voice
on
richards
side
to
bar
my
masters
heirs
in
true
descent
god
knows
i
will
not
do
it
to
the
death
god
keep
your
lordship
in
that
gracious
mind
but
i
shall
laugh
at
this
a
twelvemonth
hence
that
they
which
brought
me
in
my
masters
hate
i
live
to
look
upon
their
tragedy
well
catesby
ere
a
fortnight
make
me
older
ill
send
some
packing
that
yet
think
not
ont
tis
a
vile
thing
to
die
my
gracious
lord
when
men
are
unprepard
and
look
not
for
it
o
monstrous
monstrous
and
so
falls
it
out
with
rivers
vaughan
grey
and
so
twill
do
with
some
men
else
who
think
themselves
as
safe
as
thou
and
i
who
as
thou
knowst
are
dear
to
princely
richard
and
to
buckingham
the
princes
both
make
high
account
of
you
for
they
account
his
head
upon
the
bridge

know
they
do
and

well
deservd

my
lord

hold
my
life
as
dear
as

in
my
days
i
do
protest

it
so
precious
to
me
as
tis
now

but
that

know

state
secure
i
would
be
so
triumphant

pomfret
when
they
rode
from
london
were
jocund
and
supposd
their
state

sure

know
each
others
faces
for
our
hearts
he
knows
no
more
of
mine
than
i
of
yours
nor
i
of
his
my
lord
than
you
of
mine
lord
hastings
you
and
he
are
near
in
love
i
thank
his
grace
i
know
he
loves
me
well
but
for
his
purpose
in
the
coronation
i
have
not
sounded
him
nor
he
deliverd
his
gracious
pleasure
any
way
therein
but
you
my
noble
lords
may
name
the
time
and
in
the
dukes
behalf
ill
give
my
voice
which
i
presume
hell
take
in
gentle
part
in
happy
time
here
comes
the
duke
himself
my
noble
lords
and
cousins
all
good
morrow
i
have
been
long
a
sleeper
but
i
trust
my
absence
doth
neglect
no
great
design
which
by
my
presence
might
have
been
concluded
had
you
not
come
upon
your
cue
my
lord
william
lord
hastings
had
pronouncd
your
part
i
mean
your
voice
for
crowning
of
the
king
than
my
lord
hastings
no
man
might
be
bolder
his
lordship
knows
me
well
and
loves
me
well
my
lord
of
ely
when
i
was
last
in
holborn
i
saw
good
strawberries
in
your
garden
there
i
do
beseech
you
send
for
some
of
them
marry
and
will
my
lord
with
all
my
heart
cousin
of
buckingham
a
word
with
you
catesby
hath
sounded
hastings
in
our
business
and
finds
the
testy
gentleman
so
hot
that
he
will
lose
his
head
ere
give
consent
his
masters
child
as
worshipfully
he
terms
it
shall
lose
the
royalty
of
englands
throne
withdraw
yourself
a
while
ill
go
with
you
we
have
not
yet
set
down
this
day
of
triumph
tomorrow
in
my
judgment
is
too
sudden
for
i
myself
am
not
so
well
provided
as
else
i
would
be
were
the
day
prolongd
where
is
my
lord
the
duke
of
gloucester
i
have
sent
for
these
strawberries
his
grace
looks
cheerfully
and
smooth
this
morning
theres
some
conceit
or
other
likes
him
well
when
that
he
bids
good
morrow
with
such
spirit
i
think
theres
never
a
man
in
christendom
can
lesser
hide
his
hate
or
love
than
he
for
by
his
face
straight
shall
you
know
his
heart
what
of
his
heart
perceivd
you
in
his
face
by
any
livelihood
he
showd
today
marry
that
with
no
man
here
he
is
offended
for
were
he
he
had
shown
it
in
his
looks
i
pray
you
all
tell
me
what
they
deserve
that
do
conspire
my
death
with
devilish
plots
of
damned
witchcraft
and
that
have
prevaild
upon
my
body
with
their
hellish
charms
the
tender
love
i
bear
your
grace
my
lord
makes
me
most
forward
in
this
princely
presence
to
doom
th
offenders
whosoeer
they
be
i
say
my
lord
they
have
deserved
death
then
be
your
eyes
the
witness
of
their
evil
look
how

am
bewitchd

harlot
strumpet
shore

their
witchcraft

this
thing

did
scorn

and
disdaind
to
fly
three
times

my
footcloth
horse
did
stumble
and
startled
when
he
looked
upon
the
tower
as
loath
to
bear
me
to
the
slaughterhouse
o
now
i
need
the
priest
that
spake
to
me
i
now
repent
i
told
the
pursuivant
as
too
triumphing
how
mine
enemies
today
at
pomfret
bloodily
were
butcherd
and
i
myself
secure
in
grace
and
favour
o

a
short
shrift
he
longs
to
see
your
head
o
momentary
grace
of
mortal
man
which
we
more
hunt
for
than
the
grace
of
god
who
builds
his
hope
in
air
of
your
good
looks
lives
like
a
drunken
sailor
on
a
mast
ready
with
every
nod
to
tumble
down
into
the
fatal
bowels
of
the
deep
come

quake
and
change
thy
colour
murder
thy
breath
in
middle
of
a
word
and
then
again
begin
and
stop
again
as
if
thou
wert
distraught
and
mad
with
terror
tut
i
can
counterfeit
the
deep
tragedian
speak
and
look
back
and
pry
on
every
side
tremble
and
start
at
wagging
of
a
straw
intending
deep
suspicion
ghastly
looks
are
at
my
service
like
enforced
smiles
and
both
are
ready
in
their
offices
at
any
time
to

my
stratagems

ratcliff
and
lovel
here
is
the
head
of
that
ignoble
traitor
the
dangerous
and
unsuspected
hastings
so
dear
i
lovd
the
man
that
i
must
weep
i
took
him
for
the
plainest
harmless
creature
that
breathd
upon
the
earth
a
christian
made
him
my
book
wherein
my
soul
recorded
the
history
of
all
her
secret
thoughts
so
smooth
he
daubd
his
vice
with
show
of
virtue
that
his
apparent
open
guilt
omitted
i
mean
his
conversation
with
shores
wife
he
livd
from
all
attainder
of
suspect
well
well
he
was
the
covertst
shelterd
traitor
that
ever
livd
would
you
imagine
or
almost
believe
weret
not
that
by
great
preservation
we
live
to
tell
it
that
the
subtle
traitor
this
day
had
plotted
in
the
councilhouse
to
murder
me
and
my
good
lord
of
gloucester
had
he
done
so
what
think
you
we
are
turks
or
infidels
or
that
we
would
against
the
form
of
law
proceed
thus
rashly
in
the
villains
death
but
that
the
extreme
peril
of
the
case
the
peace
of
england
and
our
persons
safety
enforcd
us
to
this
execution
now
fair
befall
you
he
deservd
his
death
and
your
good
graces
both
have
well
proceeded
to
warn
false
traitors
from
the
like
attempts
i
never
lookd
for
better
at
his
hands
after
he
once
fell
in
with
mistress
shore
yet
had
we
not
determind
he
should
die
until
your
lordship
came
to
see
his
end
which
now
the
loving
haste
of
these
our
friends
something
against
our
meaning
hath
prevented
because
my
lord
we
would
have
had
you
heard
the
traitor
speak
and
timorously
confess
the
manner
and
the
purpose
of
his
treason
that
you
might
well
have
signified
the
same
unto
the
citizens
who
haply
may
misconster
us
in
him
and
wail
his
death
but
my
good
lord
your
graces
word
shall
serve
as
well
as
i
had
seen
and
heard
him
speak
and
do
not
doubt
right
noble
princes
both
but
ill
acquaint
our
duteous
citizens
with
all
your
just
proceedings
in
this
cause
and
to
that
end
we
wishd
your
lordship
here
to
avoid
the
censures
of
the
carping
world
but
since
you
come
too
late
of
our
intent
yet
witness
what
you
hear
we
did
intend
and
so
my
good
lord
mayor
we
bid
farewell
go
after
after
cousin
buckingham
the
mayor
towards
guildhall
hies
him
in
all
post
there
at
your
meetest
vantage
of
the
time
infer
the
bastardy
of
edwards
children
tell
them
how
edward
put
to
death
a
citizen
only
for
saying
he
would
make
his
son
heir
to
the
crown
meaning
indeed
his
house
which
by
the
sign
thereof
was
termed
so
moreover
urge
his
hateful
luxury
and
bestial
appetite
in
change
of
lust
which
stretchd
unto
their
servants
daughters
wives
even
where
his
raging
eye
or
savage
heart
without
control
lusted
to
make
a
prey
nay
for
a
need
thus
far
come
near
my
person
tell
them
when
that
my
mother
went
with
child
of
that
insatiate
edward
noble
york
my
princely
father
then
had
wars
in
france
and
by
true
computation
of
the
time
found
that
the
issue
was
not
his
begot
which
well
appeared
in
his
lineaments
being
nothing
like
the
noble
duke
my
father
yet
touch
this
sparingly
as
twere
far
off
because
my
lord
you
know
my
mother
lives
doubt
not
my
lord
ill
play
the
orator
as
if
the
golden
fee
for
which
i
plead
were
for
myself
and
so
my
lord
adieu
if
you
thrive
well
bring
them
to
baynards
castle
where
you
shall
find
me
well
accompanied
with
reverend
fathers
and
welllearned
bishops
i
go
and
towards
three
or
four
oclock
look
for
the
news
that
the
guildhall
affords
go
lovel
with
all
speed
to
doctor
shaw
go
thou
to
friar
penker
bid
them
both
meet
me
within
this
hour
at
baynards
castle
now
will
i
in
to
take
some
privy
order
to
draw
the
brats
of
clarence
out
of
sight
and
to
give
notice
that
no
manner
person
have
any
time
recourse
unto
the
princes
here
is
the
indictment
of
the
good
lord
hastings
which
in
a
set
hand
fairly
is
engrossd
that
it
may
be
today
read
oer
in
pauls
and
mark
how
well
the
sequel
hangs
together
eleven
hours
i
have
spent
to
write
it
over
for
yesternight
by
catesby
was
it
sent
me
the
precedent
was
full
as
long
adoing
and
yet
within
these
five
hours
hastings
livd
untainted
unexamind
free
at
liberty
heres
a
good
world
the
while
who
is
so
gross
that
cannot
see
this
palpable
device
yet
who
so
bold
but
says
he
sees
it
not
bad
is
the
world
and
all
will
come
to
naught
when
such
ill
dealing
must
be
seen
in
thought
how
now
how
now
what
say
the
citizens
now
by
the
holy
mother
of
our
lord
the
citizens
are
mum
say
not
a
word
touchd
you
the
bastardy
of
edwards
children
i
did
with
his
contract
with
lady
lucy
and
his
contract
by
deputy
in
france
the
insatiate
greediness
of
his
desires
and
his
enforcement
of
the
city
wives
his
tyranny
for
trifles
his
own
bastardy
as
being
got
your
father
then
in
france
and
his
resemblance
being
not
like
the
duke
withal
i
did
infer
your
lineaments
being
the
right
idea
of
your
father
both
in
your
form
and
nobleness
of
mind
laid
open
all
your
victories
in
scotland
your
discipline
in
war
wisdom
in
peace
your
bounty
virtue
fair
humility
indeed
left
nothing
fitting
for
your
purpose
untouchd
or
slightly
handled
in
discourse
and
when
my
oratory
drew
toward
end
i
bade
them
that
did
love
their
countrys
good
cry
god
save
richard
englands
royal
king
and
did
they
so
no
so
god
help
me
they
spake
not
a
word
but
like
dumb
statuas
or
breathing
stones
stard
each
on
other
and
lookd
deadly
pale
which
when
i
saw
i
reprehended
them
and
askd
the
mayor
what
meant
this
wilful
silence
his
answer
was
the
people
were
not
wont
to
be
spoke
to
but
by
the
recorder
then
he
was
urgd
to
tell
my
tale
again
thus
saith
the
duke
thus
hath
the
duke
inferrd
but
nothing
spoke
in
warrant
from
himself
when
he
had
done
some
followers
of
mine
own
at
lower
end
of
the
hall
hurld
up
their
caps
and
some
ten
voices
cried
god
save
king
richard
and
thus
i
took
the
vantage
of
those
few
thanks
gentle
citizens
and
friends
quoth
i
this
general
applause
and
cheerful
shout
argues
your
wisdom
and
your
love
to
richard
and
even
here
brake
off
and
came
away
what
tongueless
blocks
were
they
would
they
not
speak
will
not
the
mayor
then
and
his
brethren
come
the
mayor
is
here
at
hand
intend
some
fear
be
not
you
spoke
with
but
by
mighty
suit
and
look
you
get
a
prayerbook
in
your
hand
and
stand
between
two
churchmen
good
my
lord
for
on
that
ground
ill
make
a
holy
descant
and
be
not
easily
won
to
our
requests
play
the
maids
part
still
answer
nay
and
take
it
i
go
and
if
you
plead
as
well
for
them
as
i
can
say
nay
to
thee
for
myself
no
doubt
we
bring
it
to
a
happy
issue
go
go
up
to
the
leads
the
lord
mayor
knocks
welcome
my
lord
i
dance
attendance
here
i
think
the
duke
will
not
be
spoke
withal
now
catesby
what
says
your
lord
to
my
request
he
doth
entreat
your
grace
my
noble
lord
to
visit
him
tomorrow
or
next
day
he
is
within
with
two
right
reverend
fathers
divinely
bent
to
meditation
and
in
no
worldly
suit
would
he
be
movd
to
draw
him
from
his
holy
exercise
return
good
catesby
to
the
gracious
duke
tell
him
myself
the
mayor
and
aldermen
in
deep
designs
in
matter
of
great
moment
no
less
importing
than
our
general
good
are
come
to
have
some
conference
with
his
grace
ill
signify
so
much
unto
him
straight
ah
ha
my
lord
this
prince
is
not
an
edward
he
is
not
lolling
on
a
lewd
daybed
but
on
his
knees
at
meditation
not
dallying
with
a
brace
of
courtezans
but
meditating
with
two
deep
divines
not
sleeping
to
engross
his
idle
body
but
praying
to
enrich
his
watchful
soul
happy
were
england
would
this
virtuous
prince
take
on
his
grace
the
sovereignty
thereof
but
sore
i
fear
we
shall
not
win
him
to
it
marry
god
defend
his
grace
should
say
us
nay
i
fear
he
will
here
catesby
comes
again
now

what
says
his
grace
he
wonders
to
what
end
you
have
assembled
such
troops
of
citizens
to
come
to
him
his
grace
not
being
warnd
thereof
before
my
lord
he
fears
you
mean
no
good
to
him
sorry
i
am
my
noble
cousin

suspect
me
that
i
mean
no
good
to
him
by
heaven
we
come
to
him
in
perfect
love
and
so
once
more
return
and
tell
his
grace
when
holy
and
devout
religious
men
are
at
their
beads
tis
much
to
draw
them
thence
so
sweet
is
zealous
contemplation
see
where
his
grace
stands
tween
two
clergymen
two
props
of
virtue
for
a
christian
prince
to
stay
him
from
the
fall
of
vanity
and
see
a
book
of
prayer
in
his
hand
true
ornament
to
know
a
holy
man
famous
plantagenet
most
gracious
prince
lend
favourable
ear
to
our
requests
and
pardon
us
the
interruption
of
thy
devotion
and
right
christian
zeal
my
lord
there
needs
no
such
apology
i
do
beseech
your
grace
to
pardon
me
who
earnest
in
the
service
of
my
god
deferrd
the
visitation
of
my
friends
but
leaving
this
what
is
your
graces
pleasure
even
that
i
hope
which
pleaseth
god
above
and
all
good
men
of
this
ungovernd
isle
i
do
suspect
i
have
done
some
offence
that
seems
disgracious
in
the
citys
eye
and
that
you
come
to
reprehend
my
ignorance
you
have
my
lord
would
it
might
please
your
grace
on
our
entreaties
to
amend
your
fault
else
wherefore
breathe
i
in
a
christian
land
know
then
it
is
your
fault
that
you
resign
the
supreme
seat
the
throne
majestical
the
sceptred
office
of
your
ancestors
your
state
of
fortune
and
your
due
of
birth
the
lineal
glory
of
your
royal
house
to
the
corruption
of
a
blemishd
stock
whiles
in
the
mildness
of
your
sleepy
thoughts
which
here
we
waken
to
our
countrys
good
this
noble
isle
doth
want
her
proper
limbs
her
face
defacd
with
scars
of
infamy
her
royal
stock
graft
with
ignoble
plants
and
almost
shoulderd
in
the
swallowing
gulf
of
dark
forgetfulness
and
deep
oblivion
which
to
recure
we
heartily
solicit
your
gracious
self
to
take
on
you
the
charge
and
kingly
government
of
this
your
land
not
as
protector
steward
substitute
or
lowly
factor
for
anothers
gain
but
as
successively
from
blood
to
blood
your
right
of
birth
your
empery
your
own
for
this
consorted
with
the
citizens
your
very
worshipful
and
loving
friends
and
by
their
vehement
instigation
in
this
just
cause
come
i
to
move
your
grace
i
cannot
tell
if
to
depart
in
silence
or
bitterly
to
speak
in
your
reproof
best
fitteth
my
degree
or
your
condition
if
not
to
answer
you
might
haply
think
tonguetied
ambition
not
replying
yielded
to
bear
the
golden
yoke
of
sovreignty
which
fondly
you
would
here
impose
on
me
if
to
reprove
you
for
this
suit
of
yours
so
seasond
with
your
faithful
love
to
me
then
on
the
other
side
i
checkd
my
friends
therefore
to
speak
and
to
avoid
the
first
and
then
in
speaking
not
to
incur
the
last
definitively
thus
i
answer
you
your
love
deserves
my
thanks
but
my
desert
unmeritable
shuns
your
high
request
first
if
all
obstacles
were
cut
away
and
that
my
path
were
even
to
the
crown
as
the
ripe
revenue
and
due
of
birth
yet
so
much
is
my
poverty
of
spirit
so
mighty
and
so
many
my
defects
that
i
would
rather
hide
me
from
my
greatness
being
a
bark
to
brook
no
mighty
sea
than
in
my
greatness
covet
to
be
hid
and
in
the
vapour
of
my
glory
smotherd
but
god
be
thankd
there
is
no
need
of
me
and
much
i
need
to
help
you
were
there
need
the
royal
tree
hath
left
us
royal
fruit
which
mellowd
by
the
stealing
hours
of
time
will
well
become
the
seat
of
majesty
and
make
no
doubt
us
happy
by
his
reign
on
him
i
lay
that
you
would
lay
on
me
the
right
and
fortune
of
his
happy
stars
which
god
defend
that
i
should
wring
from
him
my
lord
this
argues
conscience
in
your
grace
but
the
respects
thereof
are
nice
and
trivial
all
circumstances
well
considered
you
say
that
edward
is
your
brothers
son
so
say
we
too
but
not
by
edwards
wife
for
first
was
he
contract
to
lady
lucy
your
mother
lives
a
witness
to
his
vow
and
afterward
by
substitute
betrothd
to
bona
sister
to
the
king
of
france
these
both
put
by
a
poor
petitioner
a
carecrazd
mother
to
a
many
sons
a
beautywaning
and
distressed
widow
even
in
the
afternoon
of
her
best
days
made
prize
and
purchase
of
his
wanton
eye
seducd
the
pitch
and
height
of
his
degree
to
base
declension
and
loathd
bigamy
by
her
in
his
unlawful
bed
he
got
this
edward
whom
our
manners
call
the
prince
more
bitterly
could
i
expostulate
save
that
for
reverence
to
some
alive
i
give
a
sparing
limit
to
my
tongue
then
good
my
lord
take
to
your
royal
self
this
profferd
benefit
of
dignity
if
not
to
bless
us
and
the
land
withal
yet
to
draw
forth
your
noble
ancestry
from
the
corruption
of
abusing
times
unto
a
lineal
truederived
course
do
good
my
lord
your
citizens
entreat
you
refuse
not
mighty
lord
this
profferd
love
o
make
them
joyful
grant
their
lawful
suit
alas
why
would
you
heap
those
cares
on
me
i
am
unfit
for
state
and
majesty
i
do
beseech
you
take
it
not
amiss
i
cannot
nor
i
will
not
yield
to
you
if
you
refuse
it
as
in
love
and
zeal
loath
to
depose
the
child
your
brothers
son
as
well
we
know
your
tenderness
of
heart
and
gentle
kind
effeminate
remorse
which
we
have
noted
in
you
to
your
kindred
and
egally
indeed
to
all
estates
yet
whether
you
accept
our
suit
or
no
your
brothers
son
shall
never
reign
our
king
but
we
will
plant
some
other
in
the
throne
to
the
disgrace
and
downfall
of
your
house
and
in
this
resolution
here
we
leave
you
come
citizens
we
will
entreat
no
more
call
them
again
sweet
prince
accept
their
suit
if
you
deny
them
all
the
land
will
rue
it
will
you
enforce
me
to
a
world
of
cares
call
them
again
i
am
not
made
of
stone
but
penetrable
to
your
kind
entreats
albeit
against
my
conscience
and
my
soul
cousin
of
buckingham
and
sage
grave
men
since
you
will
buckle
fortune
on
my
back
to
bear
her
burden
wher
i
will
or
no
i
must
have
patience
to
endure
the
load
but
if
black
scandal
or
foulfacd
reproach
attend
the
sequel
of
your
imposition
your
mere
enforcement
shall
acquittance
me
from
all
the
impure
blots
and
stains
thereof
for
god
doth
know
and
you
may
partly
see
how
far
i
am
from
the
desire
of
this
god
bless
your
grace
we
see
it
and
will
say
it
in
saying
so
you
shall
but
say
the
truth
then

a
time

honey
words

the
subject
of
mine
own
souls
curse
which
hitherto
hath
held
mine
eyes
from

request
i
do
remember
me
henry
the
sixth
did
prophesy
that
richmond
should
be
king
when
richmond
was
a
little
peevish
boy
a
king
perhaps
my
lord
how
chance
the
prophet
could
not
at
that
time
have
told
me
i
being
by
that
i
should
kill
him
my
lord
your
promise
for
the
earldom
richmond
when
last
i
was
at
exeter
the
mayor
in
courtesy
showd
me
the
castle
and
calld
it
rougemont
at
which
name
i
started
because
a
bard
of
ireland
told
me
once
i
should
not
live
long
after
i
saw
richmond
my
lord
ay
whats
oclock
i
am
thus
bold
to
put
your
grace
in
mind
of
what
you
promisd
me
well
but
what
ist
oclock
upon
the
stroke
of
ten
well
let
it
strike
why
let
it
strike
because
that
like
a
jack
thou
keepst
the
stroke
betwixt
thy
begging
and
my
meditation
i
am
not
in
the
giving
vein
today
why
then
resolve
me
wher
you
will
or
no
thou
troublest
me
i
am
not
in
the
vein
and
is
it
thus
repays
he
my
deep
service
with
such
contempt
made
i
him
king
for
this
o
let
me
think
on
hastings
and
be
gone
to
brecknock
while
my
fearful
head
is
on
the
tyrannous
and
bloody
act
is
done
the
most
arch
deed
of
piteous
massacre
that
ever
yet
this
land
was
guilty
of
dighton
and
forrest
whom
i
did
suborn
to
do
this
piece
of
ruthless
butchery
albeit
they
were
fleshd
villains
bloody
dogs
melting
with
tenderness
and
mild
compassion
wept
like
to
children
in
their
deaths
sad
story
oh
thus
quoth
dighton
lay
the
gentle
babes
thus
thus
quoth
forrest
girdling
one
another
within
their
alabaster
innocent
arms
their
lips
were
four
red
roses
on
a
stalk
which
in
their
summer
beauty
kissd
each
other
a
book
of
prayers
on
their
pillow
lay
which
once
quoth
forrest
almost
changd
my
mind
but
o
the
devil
there
the
villain
stoppd
when
dighton
thus
told
on
we
smothered
the
most
replenished
sweet
work
of
nature
that
from
the
prime
creation
eer
she
framd
hence
both
are
gone
with
conscience
and
remorse
they
could
not
speak
and
so
i
left
them
both
to
bear
this
tidings
to
the
bloody
king
and
here
he
comes
all
health
my
sovereign
lord
kind
tyrrell

i
happy
in
thy
news

thing

to
comfort
you
no
by
the
holy
rood
thou
knowst
it
well
thou
camst
on
earth
to
make
the
earth
my
hell
a
grievous
burden
was
thy
birth
to
me
tetchy
and
wayward
was
thy
infancy
thy
schooldays
frightful
desperate
wild
and
furious
thy
prime
of
manhood
daring
bold
and
venturous
thy
age
confirmd
proud
subtle
sly
and
bloody
more
mild
but
yet
more
harmful
kind
in
hatred
what
comfortable
hour
canst
thou
name
that
ever
gracd
me
in
thy
company
faith
none
but
humphrey
hour
that
calld
your
grace
to
breakfast
once
forth
of
my
company
if
i
be
so
disgracious
in
your
eye
let
me
march
on
and
not
offend
you
madam

drum
i
prithee
hear
me
speak
you
speak
too
bitterly
hear
me
a
word
for

speak
to
thee
again
so
either
thou
wilt
die
by
gods
just
ordinance
ere
from
this
war
thou
turn
a
conqueror
or
i
with
grief
and
extreme
age
shall
perish
and
never
look
upon
thy
face
again
therefore
take
with
thee
my
most
grievous
curse
which
in
the
day
of
battle
tire
thee
more
than
all
the
complete
armour
that
thou
wearst
my
prayers
on
the
adverse
party

and
there
the
little
souls
of
edwards
children
whisper
the
spirits
of
thine
enemies
and
promise
them
success
and
victory
bloody
thou

be
thy
end
shame
serves
thy
life
and
doth
thy
death

abides
in
me
i
say
amen
to
her
stay
madam
i
must
talk
a
word
with
you
i
have
no
moe
sons
of
the
royal
blood
for
thee
to
slaughter
for
my
daughters
richard
they
shall
be
praying
nuns
not
weeping
queens
and
therefore
level
not
to
hit
their
lives
you
have
a
daughter
calld
elizabeth
virtuous
and
fair
royal
and
gracious
and
must
she
die
for
this
o
let
her
live
and
ill
corrupt
her
manners
stain
her
beauty
slander
myself
as
false
to
edwards
bed
throw
over
her
the
veil
of
infamy
so
she
may
live
unscarrd
of
bleeding
slaughter
i
will
confess
she
was
not
edwards
daughter
wrong
not
her
birth
she
is
of
royal
blood
to
save
her
life
ill
say
she
is
not
so
her
life
is
safest
only
in
her
birth
and
only
in
that
safety
died
her
brothers
lo
at
their
births
good
stars
were
opposite
no
to
their
lives
ill
friends
were
contrary
all
unavoided
is
the
doom
of
destiny
true
when
avoided
grace
makes
destiny
my
babes
were
destind
to
a
fairer
death
if
grace
had
blessd
thee
with
a
fairer
life
you
speak
as
if
that
i
had
slain
my
cousins
cousins
indeed
and
by
their
uncle
cozend
of
comfort
kingdom
kindred
freedom
life
whose
hands
soever
lancd
their
tender
hearts
thy
head
all
indirectly
gave
direction
no
doubt
the
murderous
knife
was
dull
and
blunt
till
it
was
whetted
on
thy
stonehard
heart
to
revel
in
the
entrails
of
my
lambs
but
that
still
use
of
grief
makes
wild
grief
tame
my
tongue
should
to
thy
ears
not
name
my
boys
till
that
my
nails
were
anchord
in
thine
eyes
and
i
in
such
a
desperate
bay
of
death
like
a
poor
bark
of
sails
and
tackling
reft
rush
all
to
pieces
on
thy
rocky
bosom
madam
so
thrive
i
in
my
enterprise
and
dangerous
success
of
bloody
wars
as
i
intend
more
good
to
you
and
yours
than
ever
you
or
yours
by
me
were
harmd
what
good
is
coverd
with
the
face
of
heaven
to
be
discoverd
that
can
do
me
good
the
advancement
of
your
children
gentle
lady
up
to
some
scaffold

how
canst

woo
her
that
i
would
learn
of
you
as

being
best
acquainted
with

humour
and
wilt

send
to
her
by
the
man
that
slew
her
brothers
a
pair
of
bleeding
hearts
thereon
engrave
edward
and
york
then
haply
will
she
weep
therefore
present
to
her
as
sometime
margaret
did
to
thy
father
steepd
in
rutlands
blood
a
handkerchief
which
say
to
her
did
drain
the
purple
sap
from
her
sweet
brothers
body
and
bid
her
wipe
her
weeping
eyes
withal
if
this
inducement
move
her
not
to
love
send
her
a
letter
of
thy
noble
deeds
tell
her
thou
madst
away
her
uncle
clarence
her
uncle
rivers

and
for
her

madst
quick
conveyance
with
her
good
aunt
anne
you
mock
me
madam
this
is
not
the
way
to
win
your
daughter
there
is
no
other
way
unless
thou
couldst
put
on
some
other
shape
and
not
be
richard
that
hath
done
all
this
say
that
i
did
all
this
for
love
of
her
nay
then
indeed
she
cannot
choose
but
hate
thee
having
bought
love
with
such
a
bloody
spoil
look
what
is
done
cannot
be
now
amended
men
shall
deal
unadvisedly
sometimes
which
afterhours
give
leisure
to
repent
if
i
did
take
the
kingdom
from
your
sons
to
make
amends
ill
give
it
to
your
daughter
if
i
have
killd
the
issue
of
your
womb
to
quicken
your
increase
i
will
beget
mine
issue
of
your
blood
upon
your
daughter
a
grandams
name
is
little
less
in
love
than
is
the
doting
title
of
a
mother
they
are
as
children
but
one
step
below
even
of
your
mettle
of
your
very
blood
of
all
one
pain
save
for
a
night
of
groans
endurd
of
her
for
whom
you
bid
like
sorrow
your
children
were
vexation
to
your
youth
but
mine
shall
be
a
comfort
to
your
age
the
loss
you
have
is
but
a
son
being
king
and
by
that
loss
your
daughter
is
made
queen
i
cannot
make
you
what
amends
i
would
therefore
accept
such
kindness
as
i
can
dorset
your
son
that
with
a
fearful
soul
leads
discontented
steps
in
foreign
soil
this
fair
alliance
quickly
shall
call
home
to
high
promotions
and
great
dignity
the
king
that
calls
your
beauteous
daughter
wife
familiarly
shall
call
thy
dorset
brother
again
shall
you
be
mother
to
a
king
and
all
the
ruins
of
distressful
times
repaird
with
double
riches
of
content
what
we
have
many
goodly
days
to
see
the
liquid
drops
of
tears
that
you
have
shed
shall
come
again
transformd
to
orient
pearl
advantaging
their
loan
with
interest
of
ten
times
double
gain
of
happiness
go
then
my
mother
to
thy
daughter
go
make
bold
her
bashful
years
with
your
experience
prepare
her
ears
to
hear
a
wooers
tale
put
in
her
tender
heart
the
aspiring
flame
of
golden
sovereignty
acquaint
the
princess
with
the
sweet
silent
hours
of
marriage
joys
and
when
this
arm
of
mine
hath
chastised
the
petty
rebel
dullbraind
buckingham
bound
with
triumphant
garlands
will
i
come
and
lead
thy
daughter
to
a
conquerors
bed
to
whom
i
will
retail
my
conquest
won
and
she
shall
be
sole
victress
c
sars
c
sar
what
were
i
best
to
say
her
fathers
brother
would
be
her
lord
or
shall
i
say
her
uncle
or
he
that
slew
her
brothers
and
her
uncles
under
what
title
shall
i
woo
for
thee
that
god
the
law
my
honour
and
her
love
can
make
seem
pleasing
to
her
tender
years
infer
fair
englands
peace
by
this
alliance
which
she
shall
purchase
with
still
lasting
war
tell
her
the

that
at
her
hands
which
the
kings

forbids

shall
be
a
high
and
mighty
queen
to
wail
the
title
as
her
mother
doth
say

will
love
her
everlastingly
but
how
long
shall
that
title
ever
last
sweetly
in
force
unto
her
fair
lifes
end
but
how
long
fairly
shall
her
sweet
life
last
as
long
as
heaven
and
nature
lengthens
it
as
long
as
hell

very
jocund
in
the

of
so
fair
a
dream
how
far
into

upon
the
stroke
of

why
then
tis
time
to
arm

give

his
oration
to
his
soldiers
more
than
i
have
said
loving
countrymen
the
leisure
and
enforcement
of
the
time
forbids
to
dwell
on
yet
remember
this
god
and
our
good
cause
fight
upon

prayers
of
holy
saints
and
wronged

stand
before
our

richard
except
those
whom
we
fight
against
had
rather
have
us
win
than
him
they
follow
for
what
is
he
they
follow
truly
gentlemen
a
bloody
tyrant
and
a
homicide
one
raisd
in
blood
and
one
in
blood
establishd
one
that
made
means
to
come
by
what
he
hath
and
slaughterd
those
that
were
the
means
to
help
him
a
base
foul
stone
made
precious
by
the
foil
of
englands
chair
where
he
is
falsely
set
one
that
hath
ever
been
gods
enemy
then
if
you
fight
against
gods
enemy
god
will
in
justice
ward
you
as
his
soldiers
if
you
do
sweat
to
put
a
tyrant
down
you
sleep
in
peace
the
tyrant
being
slain
if
you
do
fight
against
your
countrys
foes
your
countrys
fat
shall
pay
your
pains
the
hire
if
you
do
fight
in
safeguard
of
your
wives
your
wives
shall
welcome
home
the
conquerors
if
you
do
free
your
children
from

your
willing

for
me
the
ransom
of
my
bold
attempt

cold
face
but
if
i

of
my

of
your
shall

thereof

taunt
my
faults

awhile
at
your
noble
pleasure
from
sicyon
ho
the
news
speak
there
the
man
from
sicyon
is
there
such
an
one
he
stays
upon
your
will
let
him
appear
these
strong
egyptian
fetters
i
must
break
or
lose
myself
in
dotage
what
are
you
fulvia
thy
wife
is
dead
where
died
she
in
sicyon
her
length
of
sickness
with
what
else
more
serious
importeth
thee
to
know
this
bears
forbear
me
theres
a
great
spirit
gone
thus
did
i
desire
it
what
our
contempts
do
often
hurl
from
us
we
wish
it
ours
again
the
present
pleasure
by
revolution
lowering
does
become
the
opposite
of
itself
shes
good
being
gone
the
hand
could
pluck
her
back
that
shovd
her
on
i
must
from
this
enchanting
queen
break
off
ten
thousand
harms
more
than
the
ills
i
know
my
idleness
doth
hatch
how
now
enobarbus
whats
your
pleasure
sir
i
must
with
haste
from
hence
why
then
we
kill
all
our
women
we
see
how
mortal
an
unkindness
is
to
them
if
they
suffer
our
departure
deaths
the
word
i
must
be
gone
under
a
compelling
occasion
let
women
die
it
were
pity
to
cast
them
away
for
nothing
though
between
them
and
a
great
cause
they
should
be
esteemed
nothing
cleopatra
catching
but
the
least
noise
of
this
dies
instantly
i
have
seen
her
die
twenty
times
upon
far
poorer
moment
i
do
think
there
is
mettle
in
death
which
commits
some
loving
act
upon
her
she
hath
such
a
celerity
in
dying
she
is
cunning
past
mans
thought
alack
sir
no
her
passions
are
made
of
nothing
but
the
finest
part
of
pure
love
we
cannot
call
her
winds
and
waters
sighs
and
tears
they
are
greater
storms
and
tempests
than
almanacs
can
report
this
cannot
be
cunning
in
her
if
it
be
she
makes
a
shower
of
rain
as
well
as
jove
would
i
had
never
seen
her
o
sir
you
had
then
left
unseen
a
wonderful
piece
of
work
which
not
to
have
been
blessed
withal
would
have
discredited
your
travel
fulvia
is
dead
sir
fulvia
is
dead
fulvia
dead
why
sir
give
the
gods
a
thankful
sacrifice
when
it
pleaseth
their
de
ties
to
take
the
wife
of
a
man
from
him
it
shows
to
man
the
tailors
of
the
earth
comforting
therein
that
when
old
robes
are
worn
out
there
are
members
to
make
new
if
there
were
no
more
women
but
fulvia
then
had
you
indeed
a
cut
and
the
case
to
be
lamented
this
grief
is
crowned
with
consolation
your
old
smock
brings
forth
a
new
petticoat
and
indeed
the
tears
live
in
an
onion
that
should
water
this
sorrow
the
business
she
hath
broached
in
the
state
cannot
endure
my
absence
and
the
business
you
have
broached
here
cannot
be
without
you
especially
that
of
cleopatras
which
wholly
depends
on
your
abode
no
more
light
answers
let
our
officers
have
notice
what
we
purpose
i
shall
break
the
cause
of
our
expedience
to
the
queen
and
get
her
leave
to
part
for
not
alone
the
death
of
fulvia
with
more
urgent
touches
do
strongly
speak
to
us
but
the
letters
too
of
many
our
contriving
friends
in
rome
petition
us
at
home
sextus
pompeius
hath
given
the
dare
to
c
sar
and
commands
the
empire
of
the
sea
our
slippery
people
whose
love
is
never
linkd
to
the
deserver
till
his
deserts
are
past
begin
to
throw
pompey
the
great
and
all
his
dignities
upon
his
son
who
high
in
name
and
power
higher
than
both
in
blood
and
life

there
queen
so
mightily
betrayd
yet
at
the
first
i
saw
the
treasons
planted
cleopatra
why
should
i
think
you
can
be
mine
and
true
though
you
in
swearing
shake
the
throned
gods
who
have
been
false
to
fulvia
riotous
madness
to
be
entangled
with
those
mouthmade
vows
which
break
themselves
in
swearing
most
sweet
queen
nay
pray
you
seek
no
colour
for
your
going
but
bid
farewell
and
go
when
you
sud
staying
then
was
the
time
for
words
no
going
then
eternity
was
in
our
lips
and
eyes
bliss
in
our
brows
bent
none
our
parts
so
poor
but
was
a
race
of
heaven
they
are
so
still
or
thou
the
greatest
soldier
of
the
world
art
turnd
the
greatest
liar
how
now
lady
i
would
i
had
thy

thou
shouldst
know
there
were
a
heart
in

hear
me
queen
the
strong
necessity
of
time
commands
our
services
awhile
but
my
full
heart
remains
in
use
with
you
our
italy
shines
oer
with
civil

sextus
pompeius
makes
his
approaches
to
the
port
of

equality
of
two
domestic
powers

scrupulous
faction
the
hated
grown
to
strength
are
newly
grown
to
love
the
condemnd
pompey
rich
in
his
fathers
honour
creeps
apace
into
the
hearts
of
such
as
have
not
thrivd
upon
the
present
state
whose
numbers
threaten
and
quietness
grown
aick
of

would
purge
by
any
desperate
change
my
more
particular
and
that
which
most
with
you
should
safe
my
going
is
fulvias
death
though
age
from
folly
could
not
give
me
freedom
it
does
from
childishness
can
fulvia
die
shes
dead
my
queen
look
here
and
at
thy
sovereign
leisure
read
the
garboils
she
awakd
at
the
last
best
see
when
and
where
she
died
o
most
false
love
where
be
the
sacred
vials
thou
shouldst
fill
with
sorrowful
water
now
i
see
i
see
in
fulvias
death
how
mine
receivd
shall
be
quarrel
no
more
but
be
prepard
to
know
the
purposes
i
bear
which
are
or
cease
as
you
shall
give
the
advice
by
the
fire
that
quickens
nilus
slime
i
go
from
hence
thy
soldier
servant
making
peace
or
war
as
thou
affectst
cut
my
lace
charmian
come
but
let
it
be
i
am
quickly
ill
and
well
so
antony
loves
my
precious
queen
forbear
and
give
true
evidence
to
his
love
which
stands
an
honourable
trial
so
fulvia
told
me
i
prithee
turn
aside
and
weep
for
her
then
bid
adieu
to
me
and
say
the
tears
belong
to
egypt
good
now
play
one
scene
of
excellent
dissembling
and
let
it
look
like
perfect
honour
youll
heat
my
blood
no
more
you
can
do
better
yet
but
this
is
meetly
now
by
my
sword
and
target
still
he
mends
but
this
is
not
the
best
look
prithee
charmian
how
this
herculean
roman
does
become
the
carriage
of
his
chafe
ill
leave
you
lady
courteous
lord
one
word
sir
you
and
i
must
part
but
that
s
not
it
sir
you
and
i
have
lovd
but
there
s
not
it
that
you
know
well
something
it
is
i
would
o
my
oblivion
is
a
very
antony
and
i
am
all
forgotten
but
that
your
royalty
holds
idleness
your
subject
i
should
take
you
for
idleness
itself
tis
sweating
labour
to
bear
such
idleness
so
near
the
heart
as
cleopatra
this
but
sir
forgive
me
since
my
becomings
kill
me
when
they
do
not
eye
well
to
you
your
honour
calls
you
hence
therefore
be
deaf
to
my
unpitied
folly
and
all
the
gods
go
with
you
upon
your
sword
sit
laurel
victory
and
smooth
success
be
strewd
before
your
feet
let
us
go
come
our
separation
so
abides
and
flies
that
thou
residing
here
gost
yet
with
me
and
i
hence
fleeting
here
remain
with
thee
away
you
may
see
lepidus
and
henceforth
know
it
is
not
c
sars
natural
vice
to
hate
our
great
competitor
from
alexandria
this
is
the
news
he
fishes
drinks
and
wastes
the
lamps
of
night
in
revel
is
not
more
manlike
than
cleopatra
nor
the
queen
of
ptolemy
more
womanly
than
he
hardly
gave
audience
or
vouchsafd
to
think
he
had
partners
you
shall
find
there
a
man
who
is
the
abstract
of
all
faults
that
all
men
follow
i
must
not
think
there
are
evils
enow
to
darken
all
his
goodness
his
faults
in
him
seem
as
the
spots
of
heaven
more
fiery
by
nights
blackness
hereditary
rather
than
purchasd
what
he
cannot
change
than
what
he
chooses
you
are
too
indulgent
let
us
grant
it
is
not
amiss
to
tumble
on
the
bed
of
ptolemy
to
give
a
kingdom
for
a
mirth
to
sit
and
keep
the
turn
of
tippling
with
a
slave
to
reel
the
streets
at
noon
and
stand
the
buffet
with
knaves
that
smell
of
sweat
say
this
becomes
him
as
his
composure
must
be
rare
indeed
whom
these
things
cannot
blemish
yet
must
antony
no
way
excuse
his
soils
when
we
do
bear
so
great
weight
in
his
lightness
if
he
filld
his
vacancy
with
his
voluptuousness
full
surfeits
and
the
dryness
of
his
bones
call
on
him
for
t
but
to
confound
such
time
that
drums
him
from
his
sport
and
speaks
as
loud
as
his
own
state
and
ours
tis
to
be
chid
as
we
rate
boys
who
being
mature
in
knowledge
pawn
their
experience
to
their
present
pleasure
and
so
rebel
to
judgment

more
than

leave

lascivious
wassails
when
thou
once
wast
beaten
from
modena
where
thou
slewst
hirtius
and
pansa

at

follow

thou
foughtst
against
though

thou
didst
drink
the
stale
of

the
gilded
puddle
which
beasts
would
cough
at
thy
palate
then
did
deign
the
roughest

thou
didst

some
did

to

all

it
wounds

amorous

black
and
wrinkled
deep
in

broadfronted
c
sar
when
thou
wast
here
above
the
ground
i
was
a
morsel
for
a
monarch
and
great
pompey
would
stand
and
make
his
eyes
grow
in
my
brow
there
would
he
anchor
his
aspect
and
die
with
looking
on
his
life
sovereign
of
egypt
hail
how
much
unlike
art
thou
mark
antony
yet
coming
from
him
that
great
medicine
hath
with
his
tinct
gilded
thee
how
goes
it
with
my
brave
mark
antony
last
thing
he
did
dear
queen
he
kissd
the
last
of
many
doubled
kisses
this
orient
pearl
his
speech
sticks
in
my
heart
mine
ear
must
pluck
it
thence
good

quoth
he
say
the
firm
roman
to

egypt
sends
this
treasure
of
an
oyster
at
whose
foot
to
mend
the
petty
present
i
will
piece
her
opulent
throne
with
kingdoms
all
the
east
say
thou
shall
call
her
mistress
so
he
nodded
and
soberly
did
mount
an
armgaunt
steed
who
neighd
so
high
that
what
i
would
have
spoke
was
beastly
dumbd
by
him
what
was
he
sad
or
merry
like
to
the
time
o
the
year
between
the
extremes
of
hot
and
cold
he
was
nor
sad
nor
merry
o
welldivided
disposition
note
him
note
him
good
charmian
tis
the
man
but
note
him
he
was
not
sad
for
he
would
shire
on
those
that
make
their
looks
by
his
he
was
not
merry
which
seemd
to
tell
them
his
remembrance
lay
in
egypt
with
his
joy
but
between
both
o
heavenly
mingle
best
thou
sad

the

that
what
they
do
delay
they
not
deny
whiles
we
are
suitors
to
their
throne
decays
the
thing
we
sue
for
we
ignorant
of
ourselves
beg
often
our
own
harms
which
the
wise
powers
deny
us
for
our
good
so
find
we
profit
by
losing
of
our
prayers
i
shall
do
well
the
people
love
me
and
the
sea
is
mine
my
powers
are
crescent
and
my
auguring
hope
says
it
will
come
to
the
full
mark
antony
in
egypt
sits
at
dinner
and
will
make
no
wars
without
doors
c
sar
gets
money
where
he
loses
hearts
lepidus
flatters
both
of
both
is
flatterd
but
he
neither
loves
nor
either
cares
for
him
c
sar
and
lepidus
are
in
the
field
a
mighty
strength
they
carry
where
have
you
this
tis
false
from
silvius
sir
he
dreams
i
know
they
are
in
rome
together
looking
for
antony
but
all
the
charms
of
love
salt
cleopatra
soften
thy
wand
lip
let
witchcraft
join
with
beauty
lust
with
both
tie
up
the
libertine
in
a
field
of
feasts
keep
his
brain
fuming
epicurean
cooks
sharpen
with
cloyless
sance
his
appetite
that
sleep
and
feeding
may
prorogue
his
honour
even
till
a
lethed
dulness
how
now
varrius
this
is
most
certain
that
i
shall
deliver
mark
antony
is
every
hour
in
rome
expected
since
he
went
from
egypt
tis
a
space
for
further
travel
i
could
have
given
less
matter
a
better
ear
menas
i
did
not
think
this
amorous
surfeiter
would
have
donnd
his
helm
for
such
a
petty
war
his
soldiership
is
twice
the
other
twain
but
let
us
rear
the
higher
our
opinion
that
our
stirring
can
from
the
lap
of
egypts
widow
pluck
the
neerlustwearied
antony
i
cannot
hope
c
sar
and
antony
shall
well
greet
together
his
wife
thats
dead
did
trespasses
to
c
sar
his
brother
warrd
upon
him
although
i
think
not
movd
by
antony
i
know
not
menas
how
lesser
enmities
may
give
way
to
greater
were
t
not
that
we
stand
up
against
them
all
twere
pregnant
they
should
square
between
themselves
for
they
have
entertained
cause
enough
to
draw
their
swords
but
how
the
fear
of
us
may
cement
their
divisions
and
bind
up
the
petty
difference
we
yet
not
know
be
it
as
our
gods
will
have
t
it
only
stands
our
lives
upon
to
use
our
strongest
hands
come
menas
good
enobarbus
tis
a
worthy
deed
and
shall
become
you
well
to
entreat
your
captain
to
soft
and
gentle
speech
i
shall
entreat
him
to
answer
like
himself
if
c
sar
move
him
let
antony
look
over
c
sars
head
and

of
antonius
beard
i
would
not
shave

today
tis
not
a
time
for
private
stomaching
every
time

for
the
matter
that
is
then
born
in

but
small
to
greater
matters
must
give
way
not
if
the
small
come
first
your
speech
is
passion
but
pray
you
stir
no
embers
up
here
comes
the
noble
antony
and
yonder
c
sar
if
we
compose
well
here
to
parthia
hark
ye
ventidius
i
do
not
know
mec
nas
ask
agrippa
noble
friends
that
which
combind
us
was
most
great
and
let
not
a
leaner
action
rend
us
whats
amiss
may
it
be
gently
heard
when
we
debate
our
trivial
difference
loud
we
do
commit
murder
in
healing
wounds
then
noble
partners
the
rather
for
i
earnestly
beseech
touch
you
the
sourest
points
with
sweetest
terms
nor
curstness
grow
to
the
matter
tis
spoken
well
were
we
before
our
armies
and
to
fight
i
should
do
thus
welcome
to
rome
thank
you
sit
sit
sir
nay
then
i
learn
you
take
things
ill
which
are
not
so
or
being
concern
you
not
i
must
be
laughd
at
if
or
for
nothing
or
a
little
i
should
say
myself
offended
and
with
you
chiefly
i
the
world
more
laughd
at
that
i
should
once
name
you
derogately
when
to
sound
your
name
it
not
concernd
me
my
being
in
egypt
c
sar
what
was
t
to
you
no
more
than
my
residing
here
at
rome
might
be
to
you
in
egypt
yet
if
you
there
did
practise
on
my
state
your
being
in
egypt
might
be
my
question
how
intend
you
practisd
you
may
be
pleasd
to
catch
at
mine
intent
by
what
did
here
befall
me
your
wife
and
brother
made
wars
upon
me
and
their
contestation
was
theme
for
you
you
were
the
word
of
war
you
do
mistake
your
business
my
brother
never
did
urge
me
in
his
act
i
did
inquire
it
and
have
my
learning
from
some
true
reports
that
drew
their
swords
with
you
did
he
not
rather
discredit
my
authority
with
yours
and
make
the
wars
alike
against
my
stomach
having
alike
your
cause
of
this
my
letters
before
did
satisfy
you
if
youll
patch
a
quarrel
as
matter
whole
you
n
have
to
make
it
with
it
must
not
be
with
this
you
praise
yourself
by
laying
defects
of
judgment
to
me
but
you
patchd
up
your
excuses
not
so
not
so
i
know
you
could
not
lack
i
am
certain
on
t
very
necessity
of
this
thought
that
i
your
partner
in
the
cause
gainst
which
he
fought
could
not
with
graceful
eyes
attend
those
wars
which
fronted
mine
own
peace
as
for
my
wife
i
would
you
had
her
spirit
in
such
another
the
third
o
the
world
is
yours
which
with
a
snaffle
you
may
pace
easy
but
not
such
a
wife
would
we
had
all
such
wives
that
the
men
might
go
to
wars
with
the
women
so
much
uncurbable
her
garboils
c
sar
made
out
of
her
impatience
which
not
wanted
shrewdness
of
policy
too
i
grieving
grant
did
you
too
much
disquiet
for
that
you
must
but
say
i
could
not
help
it
i
wrote
to
you
when
rioting
in
alexandria
you
did
pocket
up
my
letters
and
with
taunts
did
gibe
my
missive
out
of
audience
sir
he
fell
upon
me
ere
admitted
then
three
kings
i
had
newly
feasted
and
did
want
of
what
i
was
i
the
morning
but
next
day
i
told
him
of
myself
which
was
as
much
as
to
have
askd
him
pardon
let
this
fellow
be
nothing
of
our
strife
if
we
contend
out
of
our
question
wipe
him
you
have
broken
the
article
of
your
oath
which
you
shall
never
have
tongue
to
charge
me
with
soft
c
sar
no
lepidus
let
him
speak
the
honours
sacred
which
he
talks
on
now
supposing
that
i
lackd
it
but
on
c
sar
the
article
of
my
oath
to
lend
me
arms
and
aid
when
i
requird
them
the
which
you
both
denied
neglected
rather
and
then
when
poisond
hours
had
bound
me
up
from
mine
own
knowledge
as
nearly
as
i
may
ill
play
the
penitent
to
you
but
mine
honesty
shall
not
make
poor
my
greatness
nor
my
power
work
without
it
truth
is
that
fulvia
to
have
me
out
of
egypt
made
wars
here
for
which
myself
the
ignorant
motive
do
so
far
ask
pardon
as
befits
mine
honour
to
stoop
in
such
a
case
tis
noble
spoken
if
it
might
please
you
to
enforce
no
further
the
griefs
between
ye
to
forget
them
quite
were
to
remember
that
the
present
need
speaks
to
atone
you
worthily
spoken
mec
nas
or
if
you
borrow
one
anothers
love
for
the
instant
you
may
when
you
hear
no
more
words
of
pompey
return
it
again
you
shall
have
time
to
wrangle
in
when
you
have
nothing
else
to
do
thou
art
a
soldier
only
speak
no
more
that
truth
should
be
silent
i
had
almost
forgot
you
wrong
this
presence
therefore
speak
no
more
go
to
then
your
considerate
stone
i
do
not
much
dislike
the
matter
but
the
manner
of
his
speech
for
it
cannot
be
we
shall
remain
in
friendship
our
conditions
so
differing
in
their
acts
yet
if
i
knew
what
hoop
should
hold
us
stanch
from
edge
to
edge
o
the
world
i
would
pursue
it
give
me
leave
c
sar
speak
agrippa
thou
hast
a
sister
by
the
mothers
side
admird
octavia
great
mark
antony
is
now
a
widower
say
not
so
agrippa
if
cleopatra
heard
you
your
reproof
were
well
deservd
of
rashness
i
am
not
married
c
sar
let
me
hear
agrippa
further
speak
to
hold
you
in
perpetual
amity
to
make
you
brothers
and
to
knit
your
hearts
with
an
unslipping
knot
take
antony
octavia
to
his
wife
whose
beauty
claims
no
worse
a
husband
than
the
best
of
men
whose
virtue
and
whose
general
graces
speak
that
which
none
else
can
utter
by
this
marriage
all
little
jealousies
which
now
seem
great
and
all
great
fears
which
now
import
their
dangers
would
then
be
nothing
truths
would
be
but
tales
where
now
half
tales
be
truths
her
love
to
both
would
each
to
other
and
all
loves
to
both
draw
after
her
pardon
what
i
have
spoke
for
tis
a
studied
not
a
present
thought
by
duty
ruminated
will
c
sar
speak
not
till
he
hears
how
antony
is
touchd
with
what
is
spoke
already
what
power
is
in
agrippa
if
i
would
say
agrippa
be
it
so
to
make
this
good
the
power
of
c
sar
and
his
power
unto
octavia
may
i
never
to
this
good
purpose
that
so
fairly
shows
dream
of
impediment
let
me
have
thy
hand
further
this
act
of
grace
and
from
this
hour
the
heart
of
brothers
govern
in
our
loves
and
sway
our
great
designs
there
is
my
hand
a
sister
i
bequeath
you
whom
no
brother
did
ever
love
so
dearly
let
her
live
to
join
our
kingdoms
and
our
hearts
and
never
fly
off
our
loves
again
happily
amen
i
did
not
think
to
draw
my
sword
gainst
pompey
for
he
hath
laid
strange
courtesies
and
great
of
late
upon
me
i
must
thank
him
only
lest
my
remembrance
suffer
ill
report
at
heel
of
that
defy
him
time
calls
upon
s
of
us
must
pompey
presently
be
sought
or
else
he
seeks
out
us
where
lies
he
about
the
mount
misenum
whats
his
strength
by
land
great
and
increasing
but
by
sea
he
is
an
absolute
master
so
is
the
fame
would
we
had
spoke

for
it
yet

honourable
friend
agrippa
good
enobarbus
we
have
cause
to
be
glad
that
matters
are
so
well
digested
you
stayed
well
by
t
in
egypt
ay
sir
we
did
sleep
day
out
of
countenance
and
made
the
night
light
with
drinking
eight
wild
boars
roasted
whole
at
a
breakfast
and
but
twelve
persons
there
is
this
true
this
was
but
as
a
fly
by
an
eagle
we
had
much
more
monstrous
matter
of
feast
which
worthily
deserved
noting
shes
a
most
triumphant
lady
if
report
be
square
to
her
when
she
first
met
mark
antony
she
pursed
up
his
heart
upon
the
river
of
cydnus
there
she
appeared
indeed
or
my
reporter
devised
well
for
her
i
will
tell
you
the
barge
she
sat
in
like
a
burnishd
throne
burnd
on
the
water
the
poop
was
beaten
gold
purple
the
sails
and
so
perfumed
that
the
winds
were
lovesick
with
them
the
oars
were
silver
which
to
the
tune
of
flutes
kept
stroke
and
made
the
water
which
they
beat
to
follow
faster
as
amorous
of
their
strokes
for
her
own
person
it
beggard
all
description
she
did
lie
in
her
pavilion
clothofgold
of
tissue
oerpicturing
that
venus
where
we
see
the
fancy
outwork
nature
on
each
side
her
stood
prettydimpled
boys
like
smiling
cupids
with
diverscolourd
fans
whose
wind
did
seem
to
glow
the
delicate
cheeks
which
they
did
cool
and
what
they
undid
did
o
rare
for
antony
her
gentlewomen
like
the
nereides
so
many
mermaids
tended
her
i
the
eyes
and
made
their
bends
adornings
at
the
helm
a
seeming
mermaid
steers
the
silken
tackle
swell
with
the
touches
of
those
flowersoft
hands
that
yarely
frame
the
office
from
the
barge
a
strange
invisible
perfume
hits
the
sense
of
the
adjacent
wharfs
the
city
cast
her
people
out
upon
her
and
antony
enthrond
i
the
marketplace
did
sit
alone
whistling
to
the
air
which
but
for
vacancy
had
gone
to
gaze
on
cleopatra
too
and
made
a
gap
in
nature
rare
egyptian
upon
her
landing
antony
sent
to
her
invited
her
to
supper
she
replied
it
should
be
better
he
became
her
guest
which
she
entreated
our
courteous
antony
whom
neer
the
word
of
no
woman
heard
speak
being
barberd
ten
times
oer
goes
to
the
feast
and
for
his
ordinary
pays
his
heart
for
what
his
eyes
eat
only
royal
wench
she
made
great
c
sar
lay
his
sword
to
bed
he
ploughd
her
and
she
croppd
i
saw
her
once
hop
forty
paces
through
the
public
street
and
having
lost
her
breath
she
spoke
and
panted
that
she
did
make
defect
perfection
and
breathless
power
breathe
forth
now
antony
must
leave
her
utterly
never
he
will
not
age
cannot
wither
her
nor
custom
stale
her
infinite
variety
other
women
cloy
the
appetites
they
feed
but
she
makes
hungry
where
most
she
satisfies
for
vilest
things

themselves
in
her
that
the
holy
priests
bless
her
when
she
is
riggish
if
beauty
wisdom
modesty
can
settle
the
heart
of
antony
octavia

a
blessed
lottery

yourself
my

thy

you
have
done
well
by
water
and
you
by
land
i
will
praise
any
man
that
will
praise
me
though
it
cannot
be
denied
what
i
have
done
by
land
nor
what
i
have
done
by
water
yes
something
you
can
deny
for
your
own
safety
you
have
been
a
great
thief
by
sea
and
you
by
land
there
i
deny
my
land
service
but
give
me
your
hand
menas
if
our
eyes
had
authority
here
they
might
take
two
thieves
kissing
all
mens
faces
are
true
whatsoeer
their
hands
are
but
there
is
never
a
fair
woman
has
a
true
face
no
slander
they
steal
hearts
we
came
hither
to
fight
with
you
for
my
part
i
am
sorry
it
is
turned
to
a
drinking
pompey
doth
this
day
laugh
away
his
fortune
if
he
do
sure
he
cannot
weep
it
back
again
you
have
said
sir
we
looked
not
for
mark
antony
here
pray
you
is
he
married
to
cleopatra
c
sars
sister
is
called
octavia
true
sir
she
was
the
wife
of
caius
marcellus
but
she
is
now
the
wife
of
marcus
antonius
pray
ye
sir
tis
true
then
is
c
sar
and
he
for
ever
knit
together
if
i
were
bound
to
divine
of
this
unity
i
would
not
prophesy
so
i
think
the
policy
of
that
purpose
made
more
in
the
marriage
than
the
love
of
the
parties
i
think
so
too
but
you
shall
find
the
band
that
seems
to
tie
their
friendship
together
will
be
the
very
strangler
of
their
amity
octavia
is
of
a
holy
cold
and
still
conversation
who
would
not
have
his
wife
so
not
he
that
himself
is
not
so
which
is
mark
antony
he
will
to
his
egyptian
dish
again
then
shall
the
sighs
of
octavia
blow
the
fire
up
in
c
sar
and
as
i
said
before
that
which
is
the
strength
of
their
amity
shall
prove
the
immediate
author
of
their
variance
antony
will
use
his
affection
where
it
is
he
married
but
his
occasion
here
and
thus
it
may
be
come
sir
will
you

have
a
health
for

shall
take
it

lepidus
is
highcoloured
they
have
made
him
drink
almsdrink
as
they
pinch
one
another
by
the
disposition
he
cries
out
no
more
reconciles
them
to
his
entreaty
and
himself
to
the
drink
but
it
raises
the
greater
war
between
him
and
his
discretion
why
this
it
is
to
have
a
name
in
great
mens
fellowship
i
had
as
lief
have
a
reed
that
will
do
me
no
service
as
a
partisan
i
could
not
heave
to
be
called
into
a
huge
sphere
and
not
to
be
seen
to
move
int
are
the
holes
where

should
be
which
pitifully
disaster

take
the
flow
o
the
nile

certain
scales

the
pyramid

high
as
it
is
and
moves
with
it
own
organs
it
lives
by
that
which
nourisheth
it
and
the
elements
once
out
of
it
it
transmigrates
what
colour
is
it
of
of
it
own
colour

tis
a
strange
serpent

so

the
tears
of
it

that
year
indeed
he
was
troubled
with
a
rheum
what
willingly
he
did

not
look
upon
you

when
you

pleasd
that
herods
head

but
how
when

come
thou
near
most
gracious
majesty
didst
thou
behold
octavia
ay
dread
queen
where

lookd
her
in

in
her
gait
remember
if
eer
thou
lookdst
on
majesty
she
creeps
her
motion
and
her
station
are
as
one
she
shows
a
body
rather
than
a

a
statue
than
a
breather
is
this
certain
or
i
have
no
observance
three
in
egypt
cannot
make
better
note
hes
very
knowing
i

perceive
t
theres
nothing

as

more
of
semblable
import
but

wagd
new
wars

pompey
made
his
will
and
read
it
to
public
ear
spoke
scantly
of
me
when
perforce
he
could
not
but
pay
me
terms
of
honour
cold
and
sickly
he
vented
them
most
narrow
measure

me
when
the
best
hint
was
given
him
he
not
took

or
did
it
from
his
teeth

more
unhappy

solder
up
the
rift
when
it
appears
to
you
where
this
begins

having
made
use
of
him
in
the
wars
gainst
pompey
presently
denied

would
not
let

partake
in
the
glory
of
the
action
and
not

here
accuses

of
letters
he
had
formerly
wrote
to

upon
his

appeal
seizes

so
the
poor
third

a
pair
of
chaps

and
throw
between

all
the
food

hast
theyll
grind
the
one
the
other
wheres
antony
hes
walking
in
the
garden
thus
and
spurns
the
rush
that
lies
before
him
cries
fool
lepidus
and
threats
the
throat
of
that
his

and
c
sar
more

my
news
i
might
have
told

twill
be
naught
but
let

be
bring
me
to
antony
come
sir
contemning
rome
he
has
done
all
this
and
more
in
alexandria
heres
the
manner
of
t
i
the
marketplace
on
a
tribunal
silverd
cleopatra
and
himself
in
chairs
of
gold
were
publicly
enthrond
at
the
feet
sat
c
sarion
whom
they
call
my
fathers
son
and
all
the
unlawful
issue
that
their
lust
since
then
hath
made
between
them
unto
her
he
gave
the
stablishment
of
egypt
made
her
of
lower
syria
cyprus
lydia
absolute
queen
this
in
the
public
eye
i
the
common
showplace
where
they
exercise
his
sons
he
there
proclaimd
the
kings
of
kings
great
media
parthia
and
armenia
he
gave
to
alexander
to

he
assignd
syria

she
in
the
habiliments
of
the
goddess
isis
that
day
appeard
and
oft
before
gave
audience
as
tis
reported
so
let
rome
be
thus
informed
who
queasy
with
his
insolence
already
will
their
good
thoughts
call
from
him
the
people
know
it
and
have
now
receivd
his
accusations
whom
does
he
accuse
c
sar
and
that
having
in
sicily
sextus
pompeius
spoild
we
had
not
rated
him
his
part
o
the
isle
then
does
he
say
he
lent
me
some
shipping
unrestord
lastly
he
frets
that
lepidus
of
the
triumvirate
should
be
deposd
and
being
that
we
detain
all
his
revenue
sir
this
should
be
answerd
tis
done
already
and
the
messenger
gone
i
have
told
him
lepidus
was
grown
too
cruel
that
he
his
high
authority
abusd
and
did
deserve
his
change
for
what
i
have
conquerd
i
grant
him
part
but
then
in
his
armenia
and
other
of
his
conquerd
kingdoms
i
demand
the
like
hell
never
yield
to
that
nor
must
not
then
be
yielded
to
in
this
hail
c
sar
and
my

long
ere

did
appear
the

by
the

have
borne
men
and
expectation
fainted
longing
for
what
it
had
not
nay
the
dust
should
have
ascended
to
the
roof
of
heaven
raisd
by
your
populous
troops
but
you
are
come
a
marketmaid
to
rome

prevented
the
ostentation
of

left
unshown

often
left
unlovd
we
should
have
met

by
sea
and
land
supplying
every
stage
with
an
augmented
greeting

and
their

rot
that

will
appear
there
for
a
man
speak
not
against
it
i
will
not
stay
behind
nay
i
have
done
here
comes
the
emperor
is
it
not
strange
canidius
that
from
tarentum
and
brundusium
he
could
so
quickly
cut
the
ionian
sea
and
take
in
toryne
you
have
heard
on
t
sweet
celerity
is
never
more
admird
than
by
the
negligent
a
good
rebuke
which
might
have
well
becomd
the
best
of
men
to
taunt
at
slackness
canidius
we
will
fight
with
him
by
sea
by
sea
what
else
why
will
my
lord
do
so
for
that
he
dares
us
to
t
so
hath
my
lord
dard
him
to
single
fight
ay
and
to
wage
his
battle
at
pharsalia
where
c
sar
fought
with
pompey
but
these
offers
which
serve
not
for
his
vantage
he
shakes
off
and
so
should
you
your
ships
are
not
well
mannd
your
mariners
are
muleters
reapers
people
ingrossd
by
swift
impress
in

are
those
that
often
have
gainst
pompey

their

are
yare
yours
heavy
no
disgrace
shall
fall
you
for
refusing
him
at

being
prepard
for

by
sea
by
sea
most
worthy
sir
you
therein
throw
away
the
absolute
soldiership
you
have
by
land
distract
your
army
which
doth
most
consist
of
warmarkd
footmen
leave
unexecuted
your
own
renowned
knowledge
quite
forego
the
way
which
promises
assurance
and
give
up
yourself
merely
to
chance
and
hazard
from
firm
security
ill
fight
at
sea
i
have
sixty
sails
c
sar
none
better
our
overplus
of
shipping
will
we
burn
and
with
the
rest
fullmannd
from
the
head
of
actium
beat
the
approaching
c
sar
but
if
we
fail
we
then
can
do
t
at

thy
business
the
news
is
true
my
lord
he
is
descried
c
sar
has
taken
toryne
can
he
be
there
in
person
tis
impossible
strange
that
his
power
should
be
canidius
our
nineteen
legions
thou
shalt
hold
by
land
and
our
twelve
thousand
horse
well
to
our
ship
away
my
thetis
how
now
worthy
soldier
o
noble
emperor
do
not
fight
by
sea
trust
not
to
rotten
planks
do
you
misdoubt
this
sword
and
these
my
wounds
let
the
egyptians
and
the
ph
nicians
go
aducking
we
have
used
to
conquer
standing
on
the
earth
and
fighting
foot
to
foot
well
well
away
by
hercules
i
think
i
am
i
the
right
soldier
thou
art
but
his
whole
action
grows
not
in
the
power
on
t
so
our
leaders
led
and
we
are
womens
men
you
keep
by
land
the
legions
and
the
horse
whole
do
you
not
marcus
octavius
marcus
justeius
publicola
and
c
lius
are
for
sea
but
we
keep
whole
by
land
this
speed
of
c
sars
carries
beyond
belief
while
he
was
yet
in
rome
his
power
went
out
in
such
distractions
as
beguild
all
spies
whos
his
lieutenant
hear
you
they
say
one
taurus
well
i
know
the
man
the
emperor
calls
canidius
with
news
the
times
with
labour
and
throes
forth
each
minute
some
taurus
my
lord
strike
not
by
land
keep
whole
provoke
not
battle
till
we
have
done
at

do
not
exceed
the
prescript
of
this
scroll
our
fortune
lies
upon
this
jump
set
we
our
squadrons
on
yond

o
the
hill
in

of
c
sars
battle
from
which
place
we
may
the
number
of
the
ships
behold
and
so
proceed
accordingly
naught
naught
all
naught
i
can
behold
no

the

the

admiral
with
all
their

all
the
whole

of

whats
thy

the
greater
cantle
of
the
world
is
lost
with
very
ignorance
we
have
kissd
away
kingdoms
and
provinces
how
appears
the
fight
on
our
side
like
the
tokend
pestilence
where
death
is
sure
yon
ribaudred
nag
of
egypt
whom
leprosy
oertake
i

the

that
i

did
sicken
at

and
could
not
endure
a
further
view
she
once
being
loofd
the
noble
ruin
of
her
magic
antony
clapson
his
seawing
and
like
a

flies
after
her
i
never

an

of
such
shame
experience
manhood

so
itself
alack
alack
our
fortune
on
the

is
out
of
breath
and
sinks
most
lamentably
had
our
general
been
what
he
knew
himself
it
had
gone
well
o
he
has
given
example
for
our
flight
most
grossly
by

tis
his

sends
so
poor

which
had
superfluous
kings
for

not
many
moons
gone
by

and
speak
such
as

i
come
from

so
declare
thine
office
lord
of
his
fortunes
he
salutes
thee
and
requires
to
live
in
egypt
which
not
granted
he
lessens
his
requests
and
to
thee
sues
to
let
him
breathe
between
the
heavens
and
earth
a
private
man
in
athens
this
for
him
next
cleopatra
does
confess
thy
greatness
submits
her
to
thy
might
and
of
thee
craves
the
circle
of
the
ptolemies
for
her
heirs
now
hazarded
to
thy
grace
for
antony
i
have
no
ears
to

the

shall
fail

she
from

drive
her

take
his

this
if
she
perform
she
shall
not

bring

through

bands
from

win
cleopatra
promise
and
in
our
name
what
she
requires
add
more
from
thine
invention
offers
women
are
not
in
their

fortunes
strong
but

will
perjure
the
neertouchd
vestal
try
thy
cunning
thyreus
make
thine
own
edict
for
thy
pains
which
we
will
answer
as
a
law
c
sar
i
go
observe
how
antony
becomes
his
flaw
and
what
thou
thinkst
his
very
action
speaks
in
every
power
that
moves
c
sar
i
shall
what
shall
we
do
enobarbus
think
and
die
is
antony
or
we
in
fault
for
this
antony
only
that
would
make
his
will
lord
of
his
reason
what
though
you
fled
from
that
great
face
of
war
whose
several
ranges
frighted
each
other
why
should
he
follow
the
itch
of
his
affection
should
not
then
have
nickd
his
captainship
at
such
a
point
when
half
to
half
the
world
opposd
he
being
the
mered
question
twas
a
shame
no
less
than
was
his
loss
to
course
your
flying
flags
and
leave
his
navy
gazing
prithee
peace
is
that
his
answer
ay
my
lord
the
queen
shall
then
have
courtesy
so
she
will
yield
us
up
he
says
so
let
her
knowt
to
the
boy
c
sar
send
this
grizzled
head
and
he
will
fill
thy
wishes
to
the
brim
with
principalities
that
head
my
lord
to
him
again
tell
him
he
wears
the
rose
of
youth
upon
him
from
which
the
world
should
note
something
particular
his
coin
ships
legions
may
be
a
cowards
whose
ministers
would
prevail
under
the
service
of
a
child
as
soon
as
i
the
command
of
c
sar
i
dare
him
therefore
to
lay
his
gay
comparisons
apart
and
answer
me
declind
sword
against
sword
ourselves
alone
ill
write
it
follow
me
yes
like
enough
highbattled
c
sar
will
unstate
his
happiness
and
be
stagd
to
the
show
against
a
sworder
i
see
mens
judgments
are
a
parcel
of
their
fortunes
and
things
outward
do
draw
the
inward
quality
after
them
to
suffer
all
alike
that
he
should
dream
knowing
all
measures
the
full
c
sar
will
answer
his
emptiness
c
sar
thou
hast
subdud
his
judgment
too
a
messenger
from
c
sar
what
no
more
ceremony
see
my
women
against
the
blown
rose
may
they
stop
their
nose
that
kneeld
unto
the
buds
admit
him
sir
mine
honesty
and
i
begin
to
square
the
loyalty
well
held
to
fools
does
make
our
faith
mere
folly
yet
he
that
can
endure
to
follow
with
allegiance
a
falln
lord
does
conquer
him
that
did
his
master
conquer
and
earns
a
place
i
the
story
c
sars
will
hear
it
apart
none
but
friends
say
boldly
so
haply
are
they
friends
to
antony
he
needs
as
many
sir
as
c
sar
has
or
needs
not
us
if
c
sar
please
our
master
will
leap
to
be
his
friend
for
us
you
know
whose
he
is
we
are
and
that
is
c
sars
so
thus
then
thou
most
renownd
c
sar
entreats
not
to
consider
in
what
case
thou
standst
further
than
he
is
c
sar
go
on
right
royal
he
knows
that
you
embrace
not
antony
as
you
did
love
but
as
you
feard
him
o
the
scars
upon
your
honour
therefore
he
does
pity
as
constrained
blemishes
not
as
deservd
he
is
a
god
and
knows
what
is
most
right
mine
honour
was
not
yielded
but
conquerd
merely
to
be
sure
of
that
i
will
ask
antony
sir
sir
thourt
so
leaky
that
we
must
leave
thee
to
thy
sinking
for
thy
dearest
quit
thee
shall
i
say
to
c
sar
what
you
require
of
him
for
he
partly
begs
to
be
desird
to
give
it
much
would
please
him
that
of
his
fortunes
you
should
make
a
staff
to
lean
upon
but
it
would
warm
his
spirits
to
hear
from
me
you
had
left
antony
and
put
yourself
under
his
shroud
the
universal
landlord
whats
your
name

most
kind

to

prompt
to
lay
my

the
doom
of

clear
judgments
make
us
adore
our
errors
laugh
at
s
while
we
strut
to
our
confusion
o
ist
come
to
this
i
found
you
as
a
morsel
cold
upon
dead
c
sars
trencher
nay
you
were
a
fragment
of
cneius
pompeys
besides
what
hotter
hours
unregisterd
in
vulgar
fame
you
have
luxuriously
pickd
out
for
i
am
sure
though
you
can
guess
what
temperance
should
be
you
know
not
what
it
is
wherefore
is
this
to
let
a
fellow
that
will
take
rewards
and
say
god
quit
you
be
familiar
with
my
playfellow
your
hand
this
kingly
seal
and
plighter
of
high
hearts
o
that
i
were
upon
the
hill
of
basan
to
outroar
the
horned
herd
for
i
have
savage
cause
and
to
proclaim
it
civilly
were
like
a
halterd
neck
which
does
the
hangman
thank
for
being
yare
about
him
is
he
whippd
soundly
my
lord
cried
he
and
beggd
a
pardon
he
did
ask
favour
if
that
thy
father
live
let
him
repent
thou
wast
not
made
his
daughter
and
be
thou
sorry
to
follow
c
sar
in
his
triumph
since
thou
hast
been
whippd
for
following
him
henceforth
the
white
hand
of
a
lady
fever
thee
shake
thou
to
look
on
t
get
thee
back
to
c
sar
tell
him
thy
entertainment
look
thou
say
he
makes
me
angry
with
him
for
he
seems
proud
and
disdainful
harping
on
what
i
am
not
what
he
knew
i
was
he
makes
me
angry
and
at
this
time
most
easy
tis
to
do
t
when
my
good
stars
that
were
my
former
guides
have
empty
left
their
orbs
and
shot
their
fires
into
the
abysm
of
hell
if
he
mislike
my
speech
and
what
is
done
tell
him
he
has
hipparchus
my
enfranched
bondman
whom
he
may
at
pleasure
whip
or
hang
or
torture
as
he
shall
like
to
quit
me
urge
it
thou
hence
with
thy
stripes
be
gone
have
you
done
yet
alack
our
terrene
moon
is
now
eclipsd
and
it
portends
alone
the
fall
of
antony
i
must
stay
his
time
to
flatter
c
sar
would
you
mingle
eyes
with
one
that
ties
his
points
not
know
me
yet
coldhearted
toward
me
ah
dear
if
i
be
so
from
my
cold
heart
let
heaven
engender
hail
and
poison
it
in
the
source
and
the
first
stone
drop
in
my
neck
as
it
determines
so
dissolve
my
life
the
next
c
sarion
smite
till
by
degrees
the
memory
of
my
womb
together
with
my
brave
egyptians
all
by
the
discandying
of
this
pelleted
storm

graveless
till
the
flies
and
gnats
of
nile
have
buried
them
for
prey
i
am
satisfied

down
in
alexandria
where
i
will
oppose
his
fate

force
by

threatning
most
sealike
where
hast
thou

my
heart
dost
thou
hear
lady
if
from
the
field
i
shall
return
once
more
to
kiss
these
lips
i
will
appear
in

i
and
my
sword
will
earn
our
chronicle
theres
hope
in
t
yet
thats
my
brave
lord
i
will
betreblesinewd
hearted
breathd
and
fight
maliciously
for
when
mine
hours
were
nice
and
lucky
men
did
ransom
lives
of
me
for
jests
but
now
ill
set
my
teeth
and
send
to
darkness
all
that
stop
me
come
lets
have
one
other
gaudy
night
call
to
me
all
my
sad
captains
fill
our
bowls
once
more
lets
mock
the
midnight
bell
it
is
my
birthday
i
had
thought
to
have
held
it
poor
but
since
my
lord
is
antony
again
i
will
be
cleopatra
we
will
yet
do
well
call
all
his
noble
captains
to
my
lord

to
them
and
tonight
ill
force
the

through
their
scars

on
my
queen
theres
sap
in
t
yet
the
next
time
i
do
fight
ill
make
death
love
me
for
i
will
contend
even
with
his
pestilent
scythe
now
hell
outstare
the
lightning
to
be
furious
is
to
be
frighted
out
of
fear
and
in
that
mood
the
dove
will
peck
the
estridge
and
i
see
still
a
diminution
in
our
captains
brain
restores
his
heart
when
valour
preys
on
reason
it
eats
the
sword
it
fights
with
i
will
seek
some
way
to
leave
him
he
calls
me
boy
and
chides
as
he
had
power
to
beat
me
out
of
egypt
my
messenger
he
hath
whippd
with
rods
dares
me
to
personal
combat
c
sar
to
antony
let
the
old
ruffian
know
i
have
many
other
ways
to
die
meantime
laugh
at
his
challenge
c
sar
must
think
when
one
so
great
begins
to
rage
hes
hunted
even
to
falling
give
him
no
breath
but
now
make
boot
of
his
distraction
never
anger
made
good
guard
for
itself
let
our
best
heads
know
that
tomorrow
the
last
of
many
battles
we
mean
to
fight
within
our
files
there
are
of
those
that
servd

store
to
do
t
and

earnd
the

the
pauses
that
he
makes
c
sar
i
shall
wherefore
is
that
and
what
art
thou
that
darst
appear
thus
to
us
i
am
calld
dercetas
mark
antony
i
servd
who
best
was
worthy
best
to
be
servd
whilst
he
stood
up
and
spoke
he
was
my
master
and
i
wore
my
life
to
spend
upon
his
haters
if
thou
please
to
take
me
to
thee
as
i
was
to
him
ill
be
to
c

if
thou
pleasest
not
i
yield
thee
up
my
life
what
is
t
thou
sayst
i
say
o
c
sar
antony
is
dead
the
breaking
of
so
great
a
thing
should
make
a
greater
crack
the
round
world
should
have
shook
lions
into
civil
streets
and
citizens
to
their
dens
the
death
of
antony
is
not
a
single
doom
in
the
name
lay
a
moiety
of
the
world
he
is
dead
c
sar
not
by
a
public
minister
of
justice
nor
by
a
hired
knife
but
that
self
hand
which
writ
his
honour
in
the
acts
it
did
hath
with
the
courage
which
the
heart
did
lend
it
splitted
the
heart
this
is
his
sword
i
robbd
his
wound
of
it
behold
it
staind
with
his
most
noble
blood
look
you
sad
friends
the
gods
rebuke
me
but
it
is
tidings
to
wash
the
eyes
of
kings
and
strange
it
is
that
nature
must
compel
us
to
lament
our
most
persisted
deeds
his
taints
and
honours
wagd
equal
with
him
a
rarer
spirit
never
did
steer
humanity
but
you
gods
will
give
us
some
faults
to
make
us
men
c
sar
is
touchd
when
such
a
spacious
mirrors
set
before
him
he
needs
must
see
himself
o
antony
i
have
followd
thee
to
this
but
we
do
lance
diseases
in
our
bodies
i
must
perforce
have
shown
to
thee
such
a
declining
day
or
look
on
thine
we
could
not
stall
together
in
the
whole
world
but
yet
let
me
lament
with
tears
as
sovereign
as
the
blood
of
hearts
that
thou
my
brother
my
competitor
in
top
of
all
design
my
mate
in
empire
friend
and
companion
in
the
front
of
war
the
arm
of
mine
own
body
and
the
heart
where
mine
his
thoughts
did
kindle
that
our
stars
unreconciliable
should
divide
our
equalness
to
this
hear
me
good
friends
but
i
will
tell
you
at
some
meeter

known
you

when
boys
or
women

dreams
is
t
not
your
trick
i
understand
not
madam
i
dreamd
there
was
an
emperor
antony
o
such
another
sleep
that
i
might
see
but
such
another
man
if
it
might
please
ye
his
face
was
as
the
heavens
and
therein
stuck
a
sun
and
moon
which
kept
their
course
and
lighted
the
little
o
the
earth
most
sovereign
creature
his
legs
besfrid
the
ocean
his
reard
arm
crested
the
world
his
voice
was
propertied
as
all
the
tuned
spheres
and
that
to
friends
but
when
he
meant
to
quail
and
shake
the
orb
he
was
as
rattling
thunder
for
his
bounty
there
was
no
winter
in
t
an
autumn
twas
that
grew
the
more
by
reaping
his
delights
were
dolphinlike
they
showd
his
back
above
the
element
they
livd
in
in
his
livery
walkd
crowns
and
crownets
realms
and
islands
were
as
plates
droppd
from
his
pocket
cleopatra
think
you
there
was
or
might
be
such
a
man
as
this
i
dreamd
of
gentle
madam
no
you
lie
up
to
the
hearing
of
the
gods
but
if
there
be
or
ever
were
one
such
its
past
the
size
of
dreaming
nature
wants
stuff
to
vie
strange
forms
with
fancy
yet
to
imagine
an
antony
were
natures
piece
gainst
fancy
condemning
shadows
quite
hear
me
good
madam
your
loss
is
as
yourself
great
and
you
bear
it
as
answering
to
the
weight
would
i
might
never
oertake
pursud
success
but
i
do
feel
by
the
rebound
of
yours
a
grief
that
smites
my
very
heart
at
root
i
thank
you
sir
know
you
what
c
sar
means
to
do
with
me
i
am
loath
to
tell
you
what
i
would
you
knew
nay
pray
you
sir
though
he
be
honourable
hell
lead
me
then
in
triumph
madam
he
will
i
know
t
which
is
the
queen
of
egypt

is
the
emperor

arise
you
shall
not
kneel
i
pray
you
rise
rise
egypt
sir
the
gods
will
have
it
thus
my
master
and
my
lord
i
must
obey
take
to
you
no
hard
thoughts
the
record
of
what
injuries
you
did
us
though
written
in
our
flesh
we
shall
remember
as
things
but
done
by
chance
sole
sir
o
the
world
i
cannot
project
mine
own
cause
so
well
to
make
it
clear
but
do
confess
i
have
been
laden
with
like
frailties
which
before
have
often
shamd
our
sex
cleopatra
know
we
will
extenuate
rather
than
enforce
if
you
apply
yourself
to
our
intents
which
towards
you
are
most
gentle
you
shall
find
a
benefit
in
this
change
but
if
you
seek
to
lay
on
me
a
cruelty
by
taking
antonys
course
you
shall
bereave
yourself
of
my
good
purposes
and
put
your
children
to
that
destruction
which
ill
guard
them
from
if
thereon
you
rely
ill
take
my
leave
and
may
through
all
the
world
tis
yours
and
we
your
scutcheons
and
your
signs
of
conquest
shall
hang
in
what
place
you
please
here
my
good
lord
you
shall
advise
me
in
all
for
cleopatra
this

upon
his
peril
that

have
reservd
to
myself
nothing
speak
the
truth
seleucus
madam
i
had
rather

to
purchase
what

thats

o
rarely
base
good
queen
let
us
entreat
you
o
c

what
a
wounding
shame
is
this
that
thou
vouchsafing
here
to
visit
me
doing
the
honour
of
thy
lordliness
to
one
so
meek
that
mine

servant
should
parcel
the
sum
of
my
disgraces
by
addition
of
his
envy
say
good
c
sar
that
i
some
lady
trifles
have
reservd
immoment

of
such
dignity
as
we
greet
modern
friends
withal
and
say
some
nobler
token
i
have
kept
apart
for
livia
and
octavia
to
induce
their
mediation
must
i
be
unfolded
with
one
that
i
have
bred
the

smites
me
beneath
the
fall
i
have
prithee
go
hence
or

through
the
ashes
of

eat
me
you
must
not
think
i
am
so
simple
but
i
know
the
devil
himself
will
not
eat
a
woman
i
know
that
a
woman
is
a
dish
for
the
gods
if
the
devil
dress
her
not
but
truly
these
same
whoreson
devils
do
the
gods
great
harm
in
their
women
for
in
every
ten
that
they
make
the
devils
mar
five
well
get
thee
gone
farewell

i
see

to
praise
my

i
hear
him
mock
the
luck
of

their
after
wrath
husband
i
come
now
to
that

may
say

beguild
theres
dolabella
sent
from
c
sar
call
him
what
work
is
here
charmian
is
this
well
done
it
is
well
done
and
fitting
for
a
princess
descended
of
so
many
royal
kings
ah
soldier
how
goes
it
here
all
dead
c
sar
thy
thoughts
touch
their
effects
in
this
thyself
art
coming
to
see
performd
the
dreaded
act
which
thou
so
soughtst
to
hinder
o
sir
you
are
too
sure
an
augurer
that
you
did
fear
is
done
bravest
at
the
last
she
levelld
at
our
purposes
and
being
royal
took
her
own
way
the
manner
of
their
deaths
i
do
not
see
them
bleed
who
was
last
with
them
a
simple
countryman
that
brought
her
figs
this
was
his
basket
poisond
then
o
c
sar
this
charmian
livd
but
now
she
stood
and
spake
i
found
her
trimming
up
the
diadem
on
her
dead
mistress
tremblingly
she
stood
and
on
the
sudden
droppd
o
noble
weakness
if
they
had
swallowd
poison
twould
appear
by
external
swelling
but
she
looks
like
sleep
as
she
would
catch
another
antony
in
her
strong
toil
of
grace
here
on
her
breast
there
is
a
vent
of
blood
and
something
blown
the
like
is
on
her
arm
this
is
an
aspics
trail
and
these
figleaves
have
slime
upon
them
such
as
the
aspic
leaves
upon
the
caves
of
nile
most
probable
that
so
she
died
for
her
physician
tells
me
she
hath
pursud
conclusions
infinite
of
easy
ways
to
die
take
up
her
bed
and
bear
her
women
from
the
monument
she
shall
be
buried
by
her
antony
no
grave
upon
the
earth
shall
clip
in
it
a
pair
so
famous
high
events
as
these
strike
those
that
make
them
and
their
story
is
no
less
in
pity
than
his
glory
which
brought
them
to
be
lamented
our
army
shall
in
solemn
show
attend
this
funeral
and
then
to
rome
come
dolabella
see
high
order
in
this
great
solemnity
coriolanus
before
we
proceed
any
further
hear
me
speak
speak
speak
you
are
all
resolved
rather
to
die
than
to
famish
resolved
resolved
first
you
know
caius
marcius
is
chief
enemy
to
the
people
we
knowt
we
knowt
let
us
kill
him
and
well
have
corn
at
our
own
price
ist
a
verdict
no
more
talking
ont
let
it
be
done
away
away
one
word
good
citizens
we
are
accounted
poor
citizens
the
patricians
good
what
authority
surfeits
on
would
relieve
us
if
they
would
yield
us
but
the
superfluity
while
it
were
wholesome
we
might
guess
they
relieved
us
humanely
but
they
think
we
are
too
dear
the
leanness
that
afflicts
us
the
object
of
our
misery
is
as
an
inventory
to
particularise
their
abundance
our
sufferance
is
a
gain
to
them
let
us
revenge
this
with
our
pikes
ere
we
become
rakes
for
the
gods
know
i
speak
this
in
hunger
for
bread
not
in
thirst
for
revenge
would
you
proceed
especially
against
caius
marcius
against
him
first
hes
a
very
dog
to
the
commonalty
consider
you
what
services
he
has
done
for
his
country
very
well
and
could
be
content
to
give
him
good
report
fort
but
that
he
pays
himself
with
being
proud
nay
but
speak
not
maliciously
i
say
unto
you
what
he
hath
done
famously
he
did
it
to
that
end
though
softconscienced
men
can
be
content
to
say
it
was
for
his
country
he
did
it
to
please
his
mother
and
to
be
partly
proud
which
he
is
even
to
the
altitude
of
his
virtue
what
he
cannot
help
in
his
nature
you
account
a
vice
in
him
you
must
in
no
way
say
he
is
covetous
if
i
must
not
i
need
not
be
barren
of
accusations
he
hath
faults
with
surplus
to
tire
in
repetition
what
shouts
are
these
the
other
side
o
the
city
is
risen
why
stay
we
prating
here
to
the
capitol
come
come
soft
who
comes
here
worthy
menenius
agrippa
one
that
hath
always
loved
the
people
hes
one
honest
enough
would
all
the
rest
were
so
what
works
my
countrymen
in
hand
where
go
you
with
bats
and
clubs
the
matter
speak
i
pray
you
our
business
is
not
unknown
to
the
senate
they
have
had
inkling
this
fortnight
what
we
intend
to
do
which
now
well
show
em
in
deeds
they
say
poor
suitors
have
strong
breaths
they
shall
know
we
have
strong
arms
too
why
masters
my
good
friends
mine
honest
neighbours
will
you
undo
yourselves
we
cannot
sir
we
are
undone
already
i
tell
you
friends
most
charitable
care
have
the
patricians
of
you
for
your
wants
your
suffering
in
this
dearth
you
may
as
well
strike
at
the
heaven
with
your
staves
as
lift
them
against
the
roman
state
whose
course
will
on
the
way
it
takes
cracking
ten
thousand
curbs
of
more
strong
link
asunder
than
can
ever
appear
in
your
impediment
for
the
dearth
the
gods
not
the
patricians
make
it
and
your
knees
to
them
not
arms
must
help
alack
you
are
transported
by
calamity
thither
where
more
attends
you
and
you
slander
the
helms
o
the
state
who
care
for
you
like
fathers
when
you
curse
them
as
enemies
care
for
us
true
indeed
they
neer
cared
for
us
yet
suffer
us
to
famish
and
their
storehouses
crammed
with
grain
make
edicts
for
usury
to
support
usurers
repeal
daily
any
wholesome
act
established
against
the
rich
and
provide
more
piercing
statutes
daily
to
chain
up
and
restrain
the
poor
if
the
wars
eat
us
not
up
they
will
and
theres
all
the
love
they
bear
us
either
you
must
confess
yourselves
wondrous
malicious
or
be
accusd
of
folly
i
shall
tell
you
a
pretty
tale
it
may
be
you
have
heard
it
but
since
it
serves
my
purpose
i
will
venture
to
scalet
a
little
more
well
ill
hear
it
sir
yet
you
must
not
think
to
fob
off
our
disgrace
with
a
tale
but
ant
please
you
deliver
there
was
a
time
when
all
the
bodys
members
rebelld
against
the
belly
thus
accusd
it
that
only
like
a
gulf
it
did
remain
i
the
midst
o
the
body
idle
and
unactive
still
cupboarding
the
viand
never
bearing
like
labour
with
the
rest
where
the
other
instruments
did
see
and
hear
devise
instruct
walk
feel
and
mutually
participate
did
minister
unto
the
appetite
and
affection
common
of
the
whole
body
the
belly
answerd
well
sir
what
answer
made
the
belly
sir
i
shall
tell
you
with
a
kind
of
smile
which
neer
came
from
the
lungs
but
even
thus
for
look
you
i
may
make
the
belly
smile
as
well
as
speak
it
tauntingly
replied
to
the
discontented
members
the
mutinous
parts
that
envied
his
receipt
even
so
most
fitly
as
you
malign
our
senators
for
that
they
are
not
such
as
you
your
bellys
answer
what
the
kingly
crowned
head
the
vigilant
eye
the
counsellor
heart
the
arm
our
soldier
our
steed
the
leg
the
tongue
our
trumpeter
with
other
muniments
and
petty
helps
in
this
our
fabric
if
that
they
what
then
fore
me
this
fellow
speaks
what
then
what
then
should
by
the
cormorant
belly
be
restraind
who
is
the
sink
o
the
body
well
what
then
the
former
agents
if
they
did
complain
what
could
the
belly
answer
i
will
tell
you
if
youll
bestow
a
small
of
what
you
have
little
patience
a
while
youll
hear
the
bellys
answer
youre
long
about
it
note
me
this
good
friend
your
most
grave
belly
was
deliberate
not
rash
like
his
accusers
and
thus
answerd
true
is
it
my
incorporate
friends
quoth
he
that
i
receive
the
general
food
at
first
which
you
do
live
upon
and
fit
it
is
because
i
am
the
storehouse
and
the
shop
of
the
whole
body
but
if
you
do
remember
i
send
it
through
the
rivers
of
your
blood
even
to
the
court
the
heart
to
the
seat
o
the
brain
and
through
the
cranks
and
offices
of
man
the
strongest
nerves
and
small
inferior
veins
from
me
receive
that
natural
competency
whereby
they
live
and
though
that
all
at
once
you
my
good
friends
this
says
the
belly
mark
me
ay
sir
well
well
though
all
at
once
cannot
see
what
i
do
deliver
out
to
each
yet
i
can
make
my
audit
up
that
all
from
me
do
back
receive
the
flour
of
all
and
leave
me
but
the
bran
what
say
you
tot
it
was
an
answer
how
apply
you
this
the
senators
of
rome
are
this
good
belly
and
you
the
mutinous
members
for
examine
their
counsels
and
their
cares
digest
things
rightly
touching
the
weal
o
the
common
you
shall
find
no
public
benefit
which
you
receive
but
it
proceeds
or
comes
from
them
to
you
and
no
way
from
yourselves
what
do
you
think
you
the
great
toe
of
this
assembly
i
the
great
toe
why
the
great
toe
for
that
being
one
o
the
lowest
basest
poorest
of
this
most
wise
rebellion
thou
gost
foremost
thou
rascal
that
art
worst
in
blood
to
run
leadst
first
to
win
some
vantage
but
make
you
ready
your
stiff
bats
and
clubs
rome
and
her
rats
are
at
the
point
of
battle
the
one
side
must
have
bale
hail
noble
marcius
thanks
whats
the
matter
you
dissentious
rogues
that
rubbing
the
poor
itch
of
your
opinion
make
yourselves
scabs
we
have
ever
your
good
word
he
that
will
give
good
words
to
thee
will
flatter
beneath
abhorring
what
would
you
have
you
curs
that
like
nor
peace
nor
war
the
one
affrights
you
the
other
makes
you
proud
he
that
trusts
to
you
where
he
should
find
you
lions
finds
you
hares
where
foxes
geese
you
are
no
surer
no
than
is
the
coal
of
fire
upon
the
ice
or
hailstone
in
the
sun
your
virtue
is
to
make
him
worthy
whose
offence
subdues
him
and
curse
that
justice
did
it
who
deserves
greatness
deserves
your
hate
and
your
affections
are
a
sick
mans
appetite
who
desires
most
that
which
would
increase
his
evil
he
that
depends
upon
your
favours
swims
with
fins
of
lead
and
hews
down
oaks
with
rushes
hang
ye
trust
ye
with
every
minute
you
do
change
a
mind
and
call
him
noble
that
was
now
your
hate
him
vile
that
was
your
garland
whats
the
matter
that
in
these
several
places
of
the
city
you
cry
against
the
noble
senate
who
under
the
gods
keep
you
in
awe
which
else
would
feed
on
one
another
whats
their
seeking
for
corn
at
their
own
rates
whereof
they
say
the
city
is
well
stord
hang
em
they
say
theyll
sit
by
the
fire
and
presume
to
know
whats
done
i
the
capitol
whos
like
to
rise
who
thrives
and
who
declines
side
factions
and
give
out
conjectural
marriages
making
parties
strong
and
feebling
such
as
stand
not
in
their
liking
below
their
cobbled
shoes
they
say
theres
grain
enough
would
the
nobility
lay
aside
their
ruth
and
let
me
use
my
sword
id
make
a
quarry
with
thousands
of
these
quarterd
slaves
as
high
as
i
could
pick
my
lance
nay
these
are
almost
thoroughly
persuaded
for
though
abundantly
they
lack
discretion
yet
are
they
passing
cowardly
but
i
beseech
you
what
says
the
other
troop
they
are
dissolvd
hang
em
they
said
they
were
anhungry
sighd
forth
proverbs
that
hunger
broke
stone
walls
that
dogs
must
eat
that
meat
was
made
for
mouths
that
the
gods
sent
not
corn
for
the
rich
men
only
with
these
shreds
they
vented
their
complainings
which
being
answerd
and
a
petition
granted
them
a
strange
one
to
break
the
heart
of
generosity
and
make
bold
power
look
pale
they
threw
their
caps
as
they
would
hang
them
on
the
horns
o
the
moon
shouting
their
emulation
what
is
granted
them
five
tribunes
to
defend
their
vulgar
wisdoms
of
their
own
choice
ones
junius
brutus
sicinius
velutus
and
i
know
not
sdeath
the
rabble
should
have
first
unroofd
the
city
ere
so
prevaild
with
me
it
will
in
time
win
upon
power
and
throw
forth
greater
themes
for
insurrections
arguing
this
is
strange
go
get
you
home

upon
my
party
id
revolt
to
make
only
my
wars
with
him
he
is
a
lion
that
i
am
proud
to
hunt
then
worthy
marcius
attend
upon
cominius
to
these
wars
it
is
your
former
promise
sir
it
is
and
i
am
constant
titus
lartius
thou
shalt
see
me
once
more
strike
at
tullus
face
what
art
thou
stiff
standst
out
no
caius
marcius
ill
lean
upon
one
crutch
and
fight
with
tother
ere
stay
behind
this
business
o
truebred
your
company
to
the
capitol
where
i
know
our
greatest
friends
attend
us
lead
you
on
follow
cominius
we
must
follow
you
right
worthy
you
priority
noble
marcius
hence
to
your
homes
be
gone
nay
let
them
follow
the
volsces
have
much
corn
take
these
rats
thither
to
gnaw
their
garners
worshipful
mutiners
your
valour
puts
well
forth
pray
follow
was
ever
man
so
proud
as
is
this
marcius
he
has
no
equal
when
we
were
chosen
tribunes
for
the
people
markd
you
his
lip
and
eyes
nay
but
his
taunts
being
movd
he
will
not
spare
to
gird
the
gods
bemock
the
modest
moon
the
present
wars
devour
him
he
is
grown
too
proud
to
be
so
valiant
such
a
nature
tickled
with
good
success
disdains
the
shadow
which
he
treads
on
at
noon
but
i
do
wonder
his
insolence
can
brook
to
be
commanded
under
cominius
fame
at
the
which
he
aims
in
whom
already
he
is
well
gracd
cannot
better
be
held
nor
more
attaind
than
by
a
place
below
the
first
for
what
miscarries
shall
be
the
generals
fault
though
he
perform
to
the
utmost
of
a
man
and
giddy
censure
will
then
cry
out
of
marcius
o
if
he
had
borne
the
business
besides
if
things
go
well
opinion
that
so
sticks
on
marcius
shall
of
his
demerits
rob
cominius
come
half
all
cominius
honours
are
to
marcius
though
marcius
earnd
them
not
and
all
his
faults
to
marcius
shall
be
honours
though
indeed
in
aught
he
merit
not
lets
hence
and
hear
how
the
dispatch
is
made
and
in
what
fashion
more
than
his
singularity
he
goes
upon
this
present
action
lets
along
so
your
opinion
is
aufidius
that
they
of
rome
are
enterd
in
our
counsels
and
know
how
we
proceed
is
it
not
yours
what
ever
have
been
thought
on
in
this
state
that
could
be
brought
to
bodily
act
ere
rome
had
circumvention
tis
not
four
days
gone
since
i
heard
thence
these
are
the
words
i
think
i
have
the
letter
here
yes
here
it
is
they
have
pressd
a
power
but
it
is
not
known
whether
for
east
or
west
the
dearth
is
great
the
people
mutinous
and
it
is
rumourd
cominius
marcius
your
old
enemy
who
is
of
rome
worse
hated
than
of
you
and
titus
lartius
a
most
valiant
roman
these
three
lead
on
this
preparation
whither
tis
bent
most
likely
tis
for
you
consider
of
it
our
armys
in
the
field
we
never
yet
made
doubt
but
rome
was
ready
to
answer
us
nor
did
you
think
it
folly
to
keep
your
great
pretences
veild
till
when
they
needs
must
show
themselves
which
in
the
hatching
it
seemd
appeard
to
rome
by
the
discovery
we
shall
be
shortend
in
our
aim
which
was
to
take
in
many
towns
ere
almost
rome
should
know
we
were
afoot
noble
aufidius
take
your
commission
hie
you
to
your
bands
let
us
alone
to
guard
corioli
if
they
set
down
befores
for
the
remove
bring
up
your
army
but
i
think
youll
find
theyve
not
prepared
for
us
o
doubt
not
that
i
speak
from
certainties
nay
more
some
parcels
of
their
power
are
forth
already
and
only
hitherward
i
leave
your
honours
if
we
and
caius
marcius
chance
to
meet
tis
sworn
between
us
we
shall
ever
strike
till
one
can
do
no
more
the
gods
assist
you
and
keep
your
honours
safe
farewell
farewell
farewell
i
pray
you
daughter
sing
or
express
yourself
in
a
more
comfortable
sort
if
my
son
were
my
husband
i
would
freelier
rejoice
in
that
absence
wherein
he
won
honour
than
in
the
embracements
of
his
bed
where
he
would
show
most
love
when
yet
he
was
but
tenderbodied
and
the
only
son
of
my
womb
when
youth
with
comeliness
plucked
all
gaze
his
way
when
for
a
day
of
kings
entreaties
a
mother
should
not
sell
him
an
hour
from
her
beholding
i
considering
how
honour
would
become
such
a
person
that
it
was
no
better
than
picturelike
to
hang
by
the
wall
if
renown
made
it
not
stir
was
pleased
to
let
him
seek
danger
where
he
was
like
to
find
fame
to
a
cruel
war
i
sent
him
from
whence
he
returned
his
brows
bound
with
oak
i
tell
thee
daughter
i
sprang
not
more
in
joy
at
first
hearing
he
was
a
manchild
than
now
in
first
seeing
he
had
proved
himself
a
man
but
had
he
died
in
the
business
madam
how
then
then
his
good
report
should
have
been
my
son
i
therein
would
have
found
issue
hear
me
profess
sincerely
had
i
a
dozen
sons
each
in
my
love
alike
and
none
less
dear
than
thine
and
my
good
marcius
i
had
rather
had
eleven
die
nobly
for
their
country
than
one
voluptuously
surfeit
out
of
action
madam
the
lady
valeria
is
come
to
visit
you
beseech
you
give
me
leave
to
retire
myself

shall
not

i
hear
hither
your
husbands
drum
see
him
pluck
aufidius
down
by
the
hair
as
children
from
a
bear
the
volsces
shunning
him
methinks
i
see
him
stamp
thus
and
call
thus
come
on
you
cowards
you
were
got
in
fear
though
you
were
born
in
rome
his
bloody
brow
with
his
maild
hand
then
wiping
forth
he
goes
like
to
a
harvestman
thats
taskd
to
mow
or
all
or
lose
his
hire
his
bloody
brow
o
jupiter
no
blood
away
you
fool
it
more
becomes
a
man
than
gilt
his
trophy
the
breasts
of
hecuba
when
she
did
suckle
hector
lookd
not
lovelier
than
hectors
forehead
when
it
spit
forth
blood
at
grecian
swords
contemning
tell
valeria
we
are
fit
to
bid
her
welcome

friends
come
blow
thy
blast
tullus
aufidius
is
he
within
your
walls
no
nor
a
man
that
fears
you
less
than
he
thats
lesser
than
a
little
hark
our
drums
are
bringing
forth
our
youth
well
break
our
walls
rather
than
they
shall
pound
us
up
our
gates
which
yet
seem
shut
we
have
but
pinnd
with
rushes
theyll
open
of
themselves
hark
you
far
off
there
is
aufidius
list
what
work

makes
amongst
your
cloven
army
o
they

not
but
issue
forth

city
now
put
your
shields
before
your
hearts
and
fight
with
hearts
more
proof
than
shields
advance
brave
titus
they
do
disdain
us
much
beyond
our
thoughts
which
makes
me
sweat
with
wrath
come
on
my
fellows
he
that
retires
ill
take
him
for
a
volsce
and
he
shall
feel
mine
edge
all
the
contagion
of
the
south
light
on
you
you
shames
of
rome
you
herd
of
boils
and
plagues
plaster
you
oer
that
you
may
be
abhorrd
further
than
seen
and
one
infect
another
against
the
wind
a
mile
you
souls
of
geese
that
bear
the
shapes
of
men
how
have
you
run
from
slaves
that
apes
would
beat
pluto
and
hell
all
hurt
behind
backs
red
and
faces
pale
with
flight
and
agud
fear

and
charge

or
by
the
fires
of
heaven
ill
leave
the
foe
and
make
my
wars
on
you
look
to
t
come
on
if
youll
stand
fast
well
beat
them
to
their
wives
as
they
us
to
our
trenches
followd
so
now
the
gates
are
ope
now
prove
good
seconds
tis
for
the
followers
fortune
widens
them
not
for
the
fliers
mark
me
and
do
the
like
foolhardiness
not
i
nor
i
see
they
have
shut
him
in
to
the
pot
i
warrant
him
what
is
become
of
marcius
slain
sir
doubtless
following
the
fliers
at
the
very
heels
with
them
he
enters
who
upon
the
sudden
clappdto
their
gates
he
is
himself
alone
to
answer
all
the
city
o
noble
fellow
who
sensibly
outdares
his
senseless
sword
and
when
it
bows
stands
up
thou
art
left
marcius
a
carbuncle
entire
as
big
as
thou
art
were
not
so
rich
a
jewel
thou
wast
a
soldier
even
to
catos
wish
not
fierce
and
terrible
only
in
strokes
but
with
thy
grim
looks
and
the
thunderlike
percussion
of
thy
sounds
thou
madst
thine
enemies
shake
as
if
the
world
were
feverous
and
did
tremble
look
sir
o
tis
marcius
lets
fetch
him
off
or
make
remain
alike
this
will
i
carry
to
rome
and
i
this
a
murrain
ont
i
took
this
for
silver
see
here
these
movers
that
do
prize
their
hours
at
a
crackd
drachme
cushions
leaden
spoons
irons
of
a
doit
doublets
that
hangmen
would
bury
with
those
that
wore
them
these
base
slaves
ere
yet
the
fight
be
done
pack
up
down
with
them
and
hark
what
noise
the
general
makes
to
him
there
is
the
man
of
my
souls
hate
aufidius
piercing
our
romans
then
valiant
titus
take
convenient
numbers
to
make
good
the
city
whilst
i
with
those
that
have
the
spirit
will
haste
to
help
cominius
worthy
sir
thou
bleedst
thy
exercise
hath
been
too
violent
for
a
second
course
of
fight
sir
praise
me
not
my
work
hath
yet
not
warmd
me
fare
you
well
the
blood
i
drop
is
rather
physical
than
dangerous
to
me
to
aufidius
thus
i
will
appear
and
fight
now
the
fair
goddess
fortune
fall
deep
in
love
with
thee
and
her
great
charms
misguide
thy
opposers
swords
bold
gentleman
prosperity
be
thy
page
thy
friend
no
less
than
those
she
places
highest
so
farewell
thou
worthiest
marcius
go
sound
thy
trumpet
in
the
marketplace
call
thither
all
the
officers
of
the
town
where
they
shall
know
our
mind
away
breathe
you
my
friends
well
fought
we
are
come
off
like
romans
neither
foolish
in
our
stands
nor
cowardly
in
retire
believe
me
sirs
we
shall
be
chargd
again
whiles
we
have
struck
by
interims
and
conveying
gusts
we
have
heard
the
charges
of
our
friends
ye
roman
gods
lead
their
successes
as
we
wish
our
own
that
both
our
powers
with
smiling
fronts
encountering
may
give
you
thankful
sacrifice
thy
news
the
citizens
of
corioli
have
issud
and
given
to
lartius
and
to
marcius
battle
i
saw
our
party
to
their
trenches
driven
and
then
i
came
away
though
thou
speakst
truth
methinks
thou
speakst
not
well
how
long
ist
since
above
an
hour
my
lord
tis
not
a
mile
briefly
we
heard
their
drums
how
couldst
thou
in
a
mile
confound
an
hour
and
bring
thy
news
so
late
spies
of
the
volsces
held
me
in
chase
that
i
was
forcd
to
wheel
three
or
four
miles
about
else
had
i
sir
half
an
hour
since
brought
my
report
whos
yonder
that
does
appear
as
he
were
flayd
o
gods
he
has
the
stamp
of
marcius
and
i
have
beforetime
seen
him
thus
come
i
too
late
the
shepherd
knows
not
thunder
from
a
tabor
more
than
i
know
the
sound
of
marcius
tongue
from
every
meaner
man
come
i
too
late
ay
if
you
come
not
in
the
blood
of
others
but
mantled
in
your
own
o
let
me
clip
ye
in
arms
as
sound
as
when
i
wood
in
heart
as
merry
as
when
our
nuptial
day
was
done
and
tapers
burnd
to
bedward
flower
of
warriors
how
ist
with
titus
lartius
as
with
a
man
busied
about
decrees
condemning
some
to
death
and
some
to
exile
ransoming
him
or
pitying
threatning
the
other
holding
corioli
in
the
name
of
rome
even
like
a
fawning
greyhound
in
the
leash
to
let
him
slip
at
will
where
is
that
slave
which
told
me
they
had
beat
you
to
your
trenches
where
is
he
call
him
hither
let
him
alone

did
inform
the
truth
but
for
our
gentlemen
the
common
file
a
plague
tribunes
for
them
the
mouse
neer
shunnd
the
cat
as
they
did
budge
from
rascals
worse
than
they
but
how
prevaild
you
will
the
time
serve
to
tell
i
do
not
think
where
is
the
enemy
are
you
lords
o
the
field
if
not
why
cease
you
till
you
are
so
marcius
we
have
at
disadvantage
fought
and
did
retire
to
win
our
purpose
how
lies
their
battle
know
you
on
which
side
they
have
placd
their
men
of
trust
as
i
guess
marcius
their
bands
i
the
vaward
are
the
antiates
of
their
best
trust
oer
them
aufidius
their
very
heart
of
hope
i
do
beseech
you
by
all
the
battles
wherein
we
have
fought
by
the
blood
we
have
shed
together
by
the
vows
we
have
made
to
endure
friends
that
you
directly
set
me
against
aufidius
and
his
antiates
and
that
you
not
delay
the
present
but
filling
the
air
with
swords
advancd
and
darts
we
prove
this
very
hour
though
i
could
wish
you
were
conducted
to
a
gentle
bath
and
balms
applied
to
you
yet
dare
i
never
deny
your
asking
take
your
choice
of
those
that
best
can
aid
your
action
those
are
they
that
most
are
willing
if
any
such
be
here
as
it
were
sin
to
doubt
that
love
this
painting
wherein
you
see
me
smeard
if
any
fear
lesser
his
person
than
an
ill
report
if
any
think
brave
death
outweighs
bad
life
and
that
his
countrys
dearer
than
himself
let
him
alone
or
so
many
so
minded
wave
thus
to
express
his
disposition
and
follow
marcius
o
me
alone
make
you
a
sword
of
me
if

shows
be
not
outward
which
of
you
but
is
four
volsces
none
of
you
but
is
able
to
bear
against
the
great
aufidius
a
shield
as
hard
as
his
a
certain
number
though
thanks
to
all

saucd
with

i
may
spur
on

journey
i
shall
sir
the
augurer
tells
me
we
shall
have
news
tonight
good
or
bad
not
according
to
the
prayer
of
the
people
for
they
love
not
marcius
nature
teaches
beasts
to
know
their
friends
pray
you
who
does
the
wolf
love
the
lamb
ay
to
devour
him
as
the
hungry
plebeians
would
the
noble
marcius
hes
a
lamb
indeed
that
baes
like
a
bear
hes
a
bear
indeed
that
lives
like
a
lamb
you
two
are
old
men
tell
me
one
thing
that
i
shall
ask
you
well
sir
well
sir
in
what
enormity
is
marcius
poor
in
that
you
two
have
not
in
abundance
hes
poor
in
no
one
fault
but
stored
with
all
especially
in
pride
and
topping
all
others
in
boasting
this
is
strange
now
do
you
two
know
how
you
are
censured
here
in
the
city
i
mean
of
us
o
the
right
hand
file
do
you
why
how
are
we
censured
because
you
talk
of
pride
now
will
you
not
be
angry
well
well
sir
well
why
tis
no
great
matter
for
a
very
little
thief
of
occasion
will
rob
you
of
a
great
deal
of
patience
give
your
dispositions
the
reins
and
be
angry
at
your
pleasures
at
the
least
if
you
take
it
as
a
pleasure
to
you
in
being
so
you
blame
marcius
for
being
proud
we
do
it
not
alone
sir
i
know
you
can
do
very
little
alone
for
your
helps
are
many
or
else
your
actions
would
grow
wondrous
single
your
abilities
are
too
infantlike
for
doing
much
alone
you
talk
of
pride
o
that
you
could
turn
your
eyes
towards
the
napes
of
your
necks
and
make
but
an
interior
survey
of
your
good
selves
o
that
you
could
what
then
sir
why
then
you
should
discover
a
brace
of
unmeriting
proud
violent
testy
magistrates
alias
fools
as
any
in
rome
menenius
you
are
known
well
enough
too
i
am
known
to
be
a
humorous
patrician
and
one
that
loves
a
cup
of
hot
wine
with
not
a
drop
of
allaying
tiber
int
said
to
be
something
imperfect
in
favouring
the
first
complaint
hasty
and
tinderlike
upon
too
trivial
motion
one
that
converses
more
with
the
buttock
of
the
night
than
with
the
forehead
of
the
morning
what
i
think
i
utter
and
spend
my
malice
in
my
breath
meeting
two
such
wealsmen
as
you
are
i
cannot
call
you
lycurguses
if
the
drink
you
give
me
touch
my
palate
adversely
i
make
a
crooked
face
at
it
i
cannot
say
your
worships
have
delivered
the
matter
well
when
i
find
the
ass
in
compound
with
the
major
part
of
your
syllables
and
though
i
must
be
content
to
bear
with
those
that
say
you
are
reverend
grave
men
yet
they
lie
deadly
that
tell
you
have
good
faces
if
you
see
this
in
the
map
of
my
microcosm
follows
it
that
i
am
known
well
enough
too
what
harm
can
your
bisson
conspectuities
glean
out
of
this
character
if
i
be
known
well
enough
too
come
sir
come
we
know
you
well
enough
you
know
neither
me
yourselves
nor
anything
you
are
ambitious
for
poor
knaves
caps
and
legs
you
wear
out
a
good
wholesome
forenoon
in
hearing
a
cause
between
an
orangewife
and
a
fossetseller
and
then
rejourn
the
controversy
of
threepence
to
a
second
day
of
audience
when
you
are
hearing
a
matter
between
party
and
party
if
you
chance
to
be
pinched
with
the
colic
you
make
faces
like
mummers
set
up
the
bloody
flag
against
all
patience
and
in
roaring
for
a
chamberpot
dismiss
the
controversy
bleeding
the
more
entangled
by
your
hearing
all
the
peace
you
make
in
their
cause
is
calling
both
the
parties
knaves
you
are
a
pair
of
strange
ones
come
come
you
are
well
understood
to
be
a
perfecter
giber
for
the
table
than
a
necessary
bencher
in
the
capitol
our
very
priests
must
become
mockers
if
they
shall
encounter
such
ridiculous
subjects
as
you
are
when
you
speak
best
unto
the
purpose
it
is
not
worth
the
wagging
of
your
beards
and
your
beards
deserve
not
so
honourable
a
grave
as
to
stuff
a
botchers
cushion
or
to
be
entombed
in
an
asss
packsaddle
yet
you
must
be
saying
marcius
is
proud
who
in
a
cheap
estimation
is
worth
all
your
predecessors
since
deucalion
though
peradventure
some
of
the
best
of
em
were
hereditary
hangmen
good
den
to
your
worships
more
of
your
conversation
would
infect
my
brain
being
the
herdsmen
of
the
beastly
plebeians
i
will
be
bold
to
take
my
leave
of
you
how

as
fair

the
good
patricians
must
be
visited
from
whom
i
have
receivd
not
only
greetings
but
with
them
change
of
honours
i
have
livd
to
see
inherited
my
very
wishes
and
the
buildings
of
my
fancy
only
theres
one
thing
wanting
which
i
doubt
not
but
our
rome
will
cast
upon
thee
know
good
mother
i
had
rather
be
their
servant
in
my
way
than
sway
with
them
in
theirs
on
to
the
capitol
all
tongues
speak
of
him
and
the
bleared
sights
are
spectacled
to
see
him
your
prattling
nurse
into
a
rapture
lets
her
baby
cry
while
she
chats
him
the
kitchen
malkin
pins
her
richest
lockram
bout
her
reechy
neck
clambering
the
walls
to
eye
him
stalls
bulks
windows
are
smotherd
up
leads
filld
and
ridges
horsd
with
variable
complexions
all
agreeing
in
earnestness
to
see
him
seldshown
flamens
do
press
among
the
popular
throngs
and
puff
to
win
a
vulgar
station
our
veild
dames
commit
the
war
of
white
and
damask
in
their
nicelygawded
cheeks
to
the
wanton
spoil
of
ph
bus
burning
kisses
such
a
pother
as
if
that
whatsoever
god
who
leads
him
were
slily
crept
into
his
human
powers
and
gave
him
graceful
posture
on
the
sudden
i
warrant
him
consul
then
our
office
may
during
his
power
go
sleep
he
cannot
temperately
transport
his
honours
from
where
he
should
begin
and
end
but
will
lose
those
he
hath
won
in
that
theres
comfort
doubt
not
the
commoners
for
whom
we
stand
but
they
upon
their
ancient
malice
will
forget
with
the
least
cause
these
his
new
honours
which
that
hell
give
them
make
i
as
little
question
as
he
is
proud
to
dot
i
heard
him
swear
were
he
to
stand
for
consul
never
would
he
appear
i
the
marketplace
nor
on
him
put
the
napless
vesture
of
humility
nor
showing
as
the
manner
is
his
wounds
to
the
people
beg
their
stinking
breaths
tis
right
it
was
his
word
o
he
would
miss
it
rather
than
carry
it
but
by
the
suit
o
the
gentry
to
him
and
the
desire
of
the
nobles
i
wish
no
better
than
have
him
hold
that
purpose
and
to
put
it
in
execution
tis
most
like
he
will
it
shall
be
to
him
then
as
our
good
wills
a
sure
destruction
so
it
must
fall
out
to
him
or
our
authorities
for
an
end
we
must
suggest
the
people
in
what
hatred
he
still
hath
held
them
that
to
his
power
he
would
have
made
them
mules
silencd
their
pleaders
and
dispropertied
their
freedoms
holding
them
in
human
action
and
capacity
of
no
more
soul
nor
fitness
for
the
world
than
camels
in
the
war
who
have
their
provand
only
for
bearing
burdens
and
sore
blows
for
sinking
under
them
this
as
you
say
suggested
at
some
time
when
his
soaring
insolence
shall
teach
the
people
which
time
shall
not
want
if
he
be
put
upon
t
and
thats
as
easy
as
to
set
dogs
on
sheep
will
be
his
fire
to
kindle
their
dry
stubble
and
their
blaze
shall
darken
him
for
ever
whats
the
matter
you
are
sent
for
to
the
capitol
tis
thought
that
marcius
shall
be
consul
i
have
seen
the
dumb
men
throng
to
see
him
and
the
blind
to
hear
him
speak
matrons
flung
gloves
ladies
and
maids
their
scarfs
and
handkerchers
upon
him
as
he
passd
the
nobles
bended
as
to
joves
statue
and
the
commons
made
a
shower
and
thunder
with
their
caps
and
shouts
i
never
saw
the
like
lets
to
the
capitol
and
carry
with
us
ears
and
eyes
for
the
time
but
hearts
for
the
event
have
with
you
come
come
they
are
almost
here
how
many
stand
for
consulships
three
they
say
but
tis
thought
of
every
one
coriolanus
will
carry
it
thats
a
brave
fellow
but
hes
vengeance
proud
and
loves
not
the
common
people
faith
there
have
been
many
great
men
that
have
flattered
the
people
who
neer
loved
them
and
there
be
many
that
they
have
loved
they
know
not
wherefore
so
that
if
they
love
they
know
not
why
they
hate
upon
no
better
a
ground
therefore
for
coriolanus
neither
to
care
whether
they
love
or
hate
him
manifests
the
true
knowledge
he
has
in
their
disposition
and
out
of
his
noble
carelessness
lets
them
plainly
seet
if
he
did
not
care
whether
he
had
their
love
or
no
he
waved
indifferently
twixt
doing
them
neither
good
nor
harm
but
he
seeks
their
hate
with
greater
devotion
than
they
can
render
it
him
and
leaves
nothing
undone
that
may
fully
discover
him
their
opposite
now
to
seem
to
affect
the
malice
and
displeasure
of
the
people
is
as
bad
as
that
which
he
dislikes
to
flatter
them
for
their
love
he
hath
deserved
worthily
of
his
country
and
his
ascent
is
not
by
such
easy
degrees
as
those
who
having
been
supple
and
courteous
to
the
people
bonneted
without
any
further
deed
to
have
them
at
all
into
their
estimation
and
report
but
he
hath
so
planted
his
honours
in
their
eyes
and
his
actions
in
their
hearts
that
for
their
tongues
to
be
silent
and
not
confess
so
much
were
a
kind
of
ingrateful
injury
to
report
otherwise
were
a
malice
that
giving
itself
the
lie
would
pluck
reproof
and
rebuke
from
every
ear
that
heard
it
no
more
of
him
he
is
a
worthy
man
make
way
they
are
coming
having
determind
of
the
volsces
and
to
send
for
titus
lartius
it
remains
as
the
main
point
of
this
our
aftermeeting
to
gratify
his
noble
service
that
hath
thus
stood
for
his
country
therefore
please
you
most
reverend
and
grave
elders
to
desire
the
present
consul
and
last
general
in
our
wellfound
successes
to
report
a
little
of
that
worthy
work
performd
by
caius
marcius
coriolanus
whom
we
meet
here
both
to
thank
and
to
remember
with
honours
like
himself
speak
good
cominius
leave
nothing
out
for
length
and
make
us
think
rather
our
states
defective
for
requital
than
we
to
stretch
it
out
masters
o
the
people
we
do
request
your
kindest
ears
and
after
your
loving
motion
toward
the
common
body
to
yield
what
passes
here
we
are
convented
upon
a
pleasing
treaty
and
have
hearts
inclinable
to
honour
and
advance
the
theme
of
our
assembly
which
the
rather
we
shall
be
blessd
to
do
if
he
remember
a
kinder
value
of
the
people
than
he
hath
hereto
prizd
them
at
thats
off
thats
off
i
would
you
rather
had
been
silent
please
you
to
hear
cominius
speak
most
willingly
but
yet
my
caution
was
more
pertinent
than
the
rebuke
you
give
it
he
loves
your
people
but
tie
him
not
to
be
their
bedfellow
worthy
cominius
speak
nay
keep
your
place
sit
coriolanus
never
shame
to
hear
what
you
have
nobly
done
your
honours
pardon
i
had
rather
have
my
wounds
to
heal
again
than
hear
say
how
i
got
them
sir
i
hope
my
words
disbenchd
you
not
no
sir
yet
oft
when
blows
have
made
me
stay
i
fled
from
words
you
soothd
not
therefore
hurt
not
but
your
people
i
love
them
as
they
weigh
pray
now
sit
down
i
had
rather
have
one
scratch
my
head
i
the
sun
when
the
alarum
were
struck
than
idly
sit
to
hear
my
nothings
monsterd
masters
of
the
people
your
multiplying
spawn
how
can
he
flatter
thats
thousand
to
one
good
one
when
you
now
see
he
had
rather
venture
all
his
limbs
for
honour
than
one
on
s
ears
to
hear
it
proceed
cominius
i
shall
lack
voice
the
deeds
of
coriolanus
should
not
be
utterd
feebly
it
is
held
that
valour
is
the
chiefest
virtue
and
most
dignifies
the
haver
if
it
be
the
man
i
speak
of
cannot
in
the
world
be
singly
counterpoisd
at
sixteen
years
when
tarquin
made
a
head
for
rome
he
fought
beyond
the
mark
of
others
our
then
dictator
whom
with
all
praise
i
point
at
saw
him
fight
when
with
his
amazonian
chin
he
drove
the
bristled
lips
before
him
he
bestrid
an
oerpressd
roman
and
i
the
consuls
view
slew
three
opposers
tarquins
self
he
met
and
struck
him
on
his
knee
in
that
days
feats
when
he
might
act
the
woman
in
the
scene
he
provd
best
man
i
the
field
and
for
his
meed
was
browbound
with
the
oak
his
pupil
age
manenterd
thus
he
waxed
like
a
sea
and
in
the
brunt
of
seventeen
battles
since
he
lurchd
all
swords
of
the
garland
for
this
last
before
and
in
corioli
let
me
say
i
cannot
speak
him
home
he
stoppd
the
fliers
and
by
his
rare
example
made
the
coward
turn
terror
into
sport
as
weeds
before
a
vessel
under
sail
so
men
obeyd
and
fell
below
his
stem
his
sword
deaths
stamp
where
it
did
mark
it
took
from
face
to
foot
he
was
a
thing
of
blood
whose
every
motion
was
timd
with
dying
cries
alone
he
enterd
the
mortal
gate
of
the
city
which
he
painted
with
shunless
destiny
aidless
came
off
and
with
a
sudden
reenforcement
struck
corioli
like
a
planet
now
alls
his
when
by
and
by
the
din
of
war
gan
pierce
his
ready
sense
then
straight
his
doubled
spirit
requickend
what
in
flesh
was
fatigate
and
to
the
battle
came
he
where
he
did
run
reeking
oer
the
lives
of
men
as
if
twere
a
perpetual
spoil
and
till
we
calld
both
field
and
city
ours
he
never
stood
to
ease
his
breast
with
panting
worthy
man
he
cannot
but
with
measure
fit
the
honours
which
we
devise
him
our
spoils
he
kickd
at
and
lookd
upon
things
precious
as
they
were
the
common
muck
o
the
world
he
covets
less
than
misery
itself
would
give
rewards
his
deeds
with
doing
them
and
is
content
to
spend
the
time
to
end
it
hes
right
noble
let
him
be
calld
for
call
coriolanus
he
doth
appear
the
senate
coriolanus
are
well
pleasd
to
make
thee
consul
i
do
owe
them
still
my
life
and
services
it
then
remains
that
you
do
speak
to
the
people
i
do
beseech
you
let
me
oerleap
that
custom
for
i
cannot
put
on
the
gown
stand
naked
and
entreat
them
for
my
wounds
sake
to
give
their
suffrage
please
you
that
i
may
pass
this
doing
sir
the
people
must
have
their
voices
neither
will
they
bate
one
jot
of
ceremony
put
them
not
to
t
pray
you
go
fit
you
to
the
custom
and
take
to
you
as
your
predecessors
have
your
honour
with
your
form
it
is
a
part
that
i
shall
blush
in
acting
and
might
well
be
taken
from
the
people
mark
you
that
to
brag
unto
them
thus
i
did
and
thus
show
them
the
unaching
scars
which
i
should
hide
as
if
i
had
receivd
them
for
the
hire
of
their
breath
only
do
not
stand
upont
we
recommend
to
you
tribunes
of
the
people
our
purpose
to
them
and
to
our
noble
consul
wish
we
all
joy
and
honour
to
coriolanus
come
all
joy
and
honour
you
see
how
he
intends
to
use
the
people
may
they
perceive
s
intent
he
will
require
them
as
if
he
did
contemn
what
he
requested
should
be
in
them
to
give
come
well
inform
them
of
our
proceedings
here
on
the
marketplace
i
know
they
do
attend
us
once
if
he
do
require
our
voices
we
ought
not
to
deny
him
we
may
sir
if
we
will
we
have
power
in
ourselves
to
do
it
but
it
is
a
power
that
we
have
no
power
to
do
for
if
he
show
us
his
wounds
and
tell
us
his
deeds
we
are
to
put
our
tongues
into
those
wounds
and
speak
for
them
so
if
he
tell
us
his
noble
deeds
we
must
also
tell
him
our
noble
acceptance
of
them
ingratitude
is
monstrous
and
for
the
multitude
to
be
ingrateful
were
to
make
a
monster
of
the
multitude
of
the
which
we
being
members
should
bring
ourselves
to
be
monstrous
members
and
to
make
us
no
better
thought
of
a
little
help
will
serve
for
once
we
stood
up
about
the
corn
he
himself
stuck
not
to
call
us
the
manyheaded
multitude
we
have
been
called
so
of
many
not
that
our
heads
are
some
brown
some
black
some
abram
some
bald
but
that
our
wits
are
so
diversely
coloured
and
truly
i
think
if
all
our
wits
were
to
issue
out
of
one
skull
they
would
fly
east
west
north
south
and
their
consent
of
one
direct
way
should
be
at
once
to
all
the
points
o
the
compass
think
you
so
which
way
do
you
judge
my
wit
would
fly
nay
your
wit
will
not
so
soon
out
as
another
mans
will
tis
strongly
wedged
up
in
a
blockhead
but
if
it
were
at
liberty
twould
sure
southward
why
that
way
to
lose
itself
in
a
fog
where
being
three
parts
melted
away
with
rotten
dews
the
fourth
would
return
for
conscience
sake
to
help
to
get
thee
a
wife
you
are
never
without
your
tricks
you
may
you
may
are
you
all
resolved
to
give
your
voices
but
thats
no
matter
the
greater
part
carries
it
i
say
if
he
would
incline
to
the
people
there
was
never
a
worthier

twos
and

threes

to
make
his
requests

what

brought
you
to
t
mine
own
desert
your
own
desert
ay
not
mine
own
desire
how
not
your
own
desire
no
sir
twas
never
my
desire
yet
to
trouble
the
poor
with
begging
you
must
think
if
we
give
you
any
thing
we
hope
to
gain
by
you
well
then
i
pray
your
price
o
the
consulship
the
price
is
to
ask

kindly
kindly
sir
i
pray
let

ha
t
i
have
wounds
to
show
you
which
shall
be
yours
in
private
your
good
voice
sir
what
say
you
you
shall
ha
t
worthy
sir
a
match
sir
there
is
in
all
two
worthy
voices
begged
i
have
your
alms
adieu
but
this
is
something
odd
an
twere
to
give
again
but
tis
no
matter
pray
you
now
if
it
may
stand
with
the
tune
of
your
voices
that
i
may
be
consul
i
have
here
the
customary
gown
you
have
deserved
nobly
of
your
country
and
you
have
not
deserved
nobly
your
enigma
you
have
been
a
scourge
to
her
enemies
you
have
been
a
rod
to
her
friends
you
have
not
indeed
loved
the
common
people
you
should
account
me
the
more
virtuous
that
i
have
not
been
common
in
my
love
i
will
sir
flatter
my
sworn
brother
the
people
to
earn
a
dearer
estimation
of
them
tis
a
condition
they
account
gentle
and
since
the
wisdom
of
their
choice
is
rather
to
have
my
hat
than
my
heart
i
will
practise
the
insinuating
nod
and
be
off
to
them
most
counterfeitly
that
is
sir
i
will
counterfeit
the
bewitchment
of
some
popular
man
and
give
it
bountifully
to
the
desirers
therefore
beseech
you
i
may
be
consul
we
hope
to
find
you
our
friend
and
therefore
give
you
our
voices
heartily
you
have
received
many
wounds
for
your
country
i
will
not
seal
your
knowledge
with
showing
them
i
will
make
much
of
your
voices
and
so
trouble
you
no
further
the
gods
give
you
joy
sir
heartily
most
sweet
voices
better
it
is
to
die
better
to
starve
than
crave
the
hire
which
first
we
do
deserve
why
in
this
woolvish
toge
should
i
stand
here
to
beg
of
hob
and
dick
that
do
appear
their
needless
vouches
custom
calls
me
to
t
what
custom
wills
in
all
things
should
we
do
t
the
dust
on
antique
time
would
lie
unswept
and
mountainous
error
be
too
highly
heapd
for
truth
to
oerpeer
rather
than
fool
it
so
let
the
high
office
and
the
honour
go
to
one
that
would
do
thus
i
am
half
through
the
one
part
sufferd
the
other
will
i
do
here
come
more
voices
your
voices
for
your
voices
i
have
fought
watchd
for
your
voices
for
your
voices
bear
of
wounds
two
dozen
odd
battles
thrice
six
i
have
seen
and
heard
of
for
your
voices
have
done
many
things
some
less
some
more
your
voices
indeed
i
would
be
consul
he
has
done
nobly
and
cannot
go
without
any
honest
mans
voice
therefore
let
him
be
consul
the
gods
give
him
joy
and
make
him
good
friend
to
the
people
amen
amen
god
save
thee
noble
consul
worthy
voices
you
have
stood
your
limitation
and
the
tribunes
endue
you
with
the
peoples
voice
remains
that
in
the
official
marks
invested
you
anon
do
meet
the
senate
is
this
done
the
custom
of
request
you
have
dischargd
the
people
do
admit
you
and
are
summond
to
meet
anon
upon
your
approbation
where
at
the
senatehouse
there
coriolanus
may
i
change
these
garments
you
may
sir
that
ill
straight
do
and
knowing
myself
again
repair
to
the
senatehouse
ill
keep
you
company
will
you
along
we
stay
here
for
the
people
fare
you
well
he
has
it
now
and
by
his
looks
methinks
tis
warm
ats
heart
with
a
proud
heart
he
wore
his
humble
weeds
will
you
dismiss
the
people
how
now
my
masters
have
you
chose
this
man
he
has
our
voices
sir
we
pray
the
gods
he
may
deserve
your
love
amen
sir
to
my
poor
unworthy
notice
he
mockd
us
when
he
beggd
our
voices
certainly
he
flouted
us
downright
no
tis
his
kind
of
speech
he
did
not
mock
us
not
one
amongst
us
save
yourself
but
says
he
used
us
scornfully
he
should
have
showd
us
his
marks
of
merit
wounds
receivd
fors
country
why
so
he
did
i
am
sure
no
no
no
man
saw
em
he
said
he
had
wounds
which
he
could
show
in
private
and
with
his
hat
thus
waving
it
in
scorn
i
would
be
consul
says
he
aged
custom
but
by
your
voices
will
not
so
permit
me
your
voices
therefore
when
we
granted
that
here
was
i
thank
you
for
your
voices
thank
you
your
most
sweet
voices
now
you
have
left
your
voices
i
have
no
further
with
you
was
not
this
mockery
why
either
were
you
ignorant
to
see
t
or
seeing
it
of
such
childish
friendliness
to
yield
your
voices
could
you
not
have
told
him
as
you
were
lessond
when
he
had
no
power
but
was
a
petty
servant
to
the
state
he
was
your
enemy
ever
spake
against
your
liberties
and
the
charters
that
you
bear
i
the
body
of
the
weal
and
now
arriving
a
place
of
potency
and
sway
o
the
state
if
he
should
still
malignantly
remain
fast
foe
to
the
plebeii
your
voices
might
be
curses
to
yourselves
you
should
have
said
that
as
his
worthy
deeds
did
claim
no
less
than
what
he
stood
for
so
his
gracious
nature
would
think
upon
you
for
your
voices
and
translate
his
malice
towards
you
into
love
standing
your
friendly
lord
thus
to
have
said
as
you
were
foreadvisd
had
touchd
his
spirit
and
tried
his
inclination
from
him
pluckd
either
his
gracious
promise
which
you
might
as
cause
had
calld
you
up
have
held
him
to
or
else
it
would
have
galld
his
surly
nature
which
easily
endures
not
article
tying
him
to
aught
so
putting
him
to
rage
you
should
have
taen
the
advantage
of
his
choler
and
passd
him
unelected
did
you
perceive
he
did
solicit
you
in
free
contempt
when
he
did
need
your
loves
and
do
you
think
that
his
contempt
shall
not
be
bruising
to
you
when
he
hath
power
to
crush
why
had
your
bodies
no
heart
among
you
or
had
you
tongues
to
cry
against
the
rectorship
of
judgment
have
you
ere
now
denied
the
asker
and
now
again
of
him
that
did
not
ask
but
mock
bestow
your
sudfor
tongues
hes
not
confirmd
we
may
deny
him
yet
and
will
deny
him
ill
have
five
hundred
voices
of
that
sound
ay
twice
five
hundred
and
their
friends
to
piece
em
get
you
hence
instantly
and
tell
those
friends
they
have
chose
a
consul
that
will
from
them
take
their
liberties
make
them
of
no
more
voice
than
dogs
that
are
as
often
beat
for
barking
as
therefore
kept
to
do
so
let
them
assemble
and
on
a
safer
judgment
all
revoke
your
ignorant
election
enforce
his
pride
and
his
old
hate
unto
you
besides
forget
not
with
what
contempt
he
wore
the
humble
weed
how
in
his
suit
he
scornd
you
but
your
loves
thinking
upon
his
services
took
from
you
the
apprehension
of
his
present
portance
which
most
gibingly
ungravely
he
did
fashion
after
the
inveterate
hate
he
bears
you
lay
a
fault
on
us
your
tribunes
that
we
labourd
no
impediment
between
but
that
you
must
cast
your
election
on
him
say
you
chose
him
more
after
our
commandment
than
as
guided
by
your
own
true
affections
and
that
your
minds
preoccupied
with
what
you
rather
must
do
than
what
you
should
made
you
against
the
grain
to
voice
him
consul
lay
the
fault
on
us
ay
spare
us
not
say
we
read
lectures
to
you
how
youngly
he
began
to
serve
his
country
how
long
continud
and
what
stock
he
springs
of
the
noble
house
o
the
marcians
from
whence
came
that
ancus
marcius
numas
daughters
son
who
after
great
hostilius
here
was
king
of
the
same
house
publius
and
quintus
were
that
our
best
water
brought
by
conduits
hither
and
censorinus
that
was
so
surnamd
and
nobly
namd
so
twice
being
censor
was
his
great
ancestor
one
thus
descended
that
hath
beside
well
in
his
person
wrought
to
be
set
high
in
place
we
did
commend
to
your
remembrances
but
you
have
found
scaling
his
present
bearing
with
his
past
that
hes
your
fixed
enemy
and
revoke
your
sudden
approbation
say
you
neer
had
done
t
harp
on
that
still
but
by
our
putting
on
and
presently
when
you
have
drawn
your
number
repair
to
the
capitol
we
will
so
almost
all
repent
in
their
election
let
them
go
on
this
mutiny
were
better
put
in
hazard
than
stay
past
doubt
for
greater
if
as
his
nature
is
he
fall
in
rage
with
their
refusal
both
observe
and
answer
the
vantage
of
his
anger
to
the
capitol
come
we
will
be
there
before
the
stream
o
the
people
and
this
shall
seem
as
partly
tis
their
own
which
we
have
goaded
onward
tullus
aufidius
then
had
made
new
head
he
had
my
lord
and
that
it
was
which
causd
our
swifter
composition
so
then
the
volsces
stand
but
as
at
first
ready
when
time
shall
prompt
them
to
make
road
upon
s
again
they
are
worn
lord
consul
so
that
we
shall
hardly
in
our
ages
see
their
banners
wave
again
saw
you
aufidius
on
safeguard
he
came
to
me
and
did
curse
against
the
volsces
for
they
had
so
vilely
yielded
the
town
he
is
retird
to
antium
spoke
he
of
me
he
did
my
lord
how
what
how
often
he
had
met
you
sword
to
sword
that
of
all
things
upon
the
earth
he
hated
your
person
most
that
he
would
pawn
his
fortunes
to
hopeless
restitution
so
he
might
be
calld
your
vanquisher
at
antium
lives
he
at
antium
i
wish
i
had
a
cause
to
seek
him
there
to
oppose
his
hatred
fully
welcome
home
behold
these
are
the
tribunes
of
the
people
the
tongues
o
the
common
mouth
i
do
despise
them
for
they
do
prank
them
in
authority
against
all
noble
sufferance
pass
no
further
ha
what
is
that
it
will
be
dangerous
to
go
on
no
further
what
makes
this
change
the
matter
hath
he
not
passd
the
noble
and
the
common
cominius
no
have
i
had
childrens

tribunes
give
way
he
shall
to
the
marketplace
the
people
are
incensd
against
him
stop
or
all
will
fall
in
broil
are
these
your
herd
must
these
have
voices
that
can
yield
them
now
and
straight
disclaim
their
tongues
what
are
your
offices
you
being
their
mouths
why
rule
you
not
their
teeth
have
you
not
set
them
on
be
calm
be
calm
it
is
a
purposd
thing
and
grows
by
plot
to
curb
the
will
of
the
nobility
suffert
and
live
with
such
as
cannot
rule
nor
ever
will
be
ruld
callt
not

people
cry
you
mockd
them
and
of
late
when

repind
scandalld
the
suppliants
for
the
people
calld
them
timepleasers
flatterers
foes
to

this
was
known
before
not

you
informd
them
sithence
how
i
inform
them
you
are
like
to
do
such
business
not

each
way
to
better
yours
why
then
should
i
be
consul
by
yond
clouds
let
me
deserve
so
ill
as
you
and
make
me
your
fellow
tribune
you
show
too
much
of
that
for
which
the
people
stir
if
you
will
pass
to
where
you
are
bound
you
must
inquire
your
way
which
you
are
out
of
with
a
gentler
spirit
or
never
be
so
noble
as
a
consul
nor

be
calm
the

dishonourd
rub

i
the
plain
way
of
his
merit

was
my
speech
and

their
pardons
for
the
mutable
rankscented

therein
behold
themselves
i
say
again
in
soothing
them
we
nourish
gainst
our
senate
the
cockle
of
rebellion
insolence
sedition
which
we
ourselves
have
ploughd
for
sowd
and
scatterd
by
mingling
them
with
us
the
honourd
number
who
lackd
not
virtue
no
nor
power
but
that
which
they
have
given
to
beggars
well
no

words
we
beseech
you
how
no
more
as
for
my
country

my
lungs

as
patient
as
the

not
poison
any
further
shall
remain
hear
you
this
triton
of
the
minnows
mark
you
his
absolute
shall
twas
from
the
canon
shall
o
good
but
most
unwise
patricians
why
you
grave
but
reckless
senators
have
you
thus
given
hydra
here
to
choose
an
officer
that
with
his
peremptory
shall
being

how
soon
confusion
may
enter
twixt
the
gap
of
both

usd
sometime
in
greece
well
well
no
more
of
that
though
there
the
people
had
more
absolute
power
i
say
they
nourishd
disobedience
fed
the
ruin
of
the
state
why
shall
the
people
give
one
that
speaks
thus
their
voice
ill
give
my
reasons
more
worthier
than
their
voices
they
know
the
corn
was
not
our
recompense
resting
well
assurd
they
neer
did
service
for
t
being
pressd
to
the
war
even
when
the
navel
of
the
state
was
touchd
they
would
not
thread
the
gates
this
kind
of
service
did
not
deserve
corn
gratis
being
i
the
war
their
mutinies
and
revolts
wherein
they
showd
most
valour
spoke
not
for
them
the
accusation
which
they
have
often
made
against
the
senate
all
cause
unborn
could
never
be
the
motive
of
our
so
frank
donation
well
what
then
how
shall
this
bisson
multitude
digest
the
senates
courtesy
let
deeds
express
whats
like
to
be
their
words
we
did
request
it
we
are
the
greater
poll
and
in
true
fear
they
gave
us
our
demands
thus
we
debase
the
nature
of
our
seats
and
make
the
rabble
call
our
cares
fears
which
will
in
time
break
ope
the
locks
o
the
senate
and
bring
in
the
crows
to
peck
the
eagles
come
enough
enough
with
overmeasure
no
take
more
what
may
be
sworn
by
both
divine
and
human
seal
what
i
end
withal
this
double
worship
where
one
part
does
disdain
with
cause
the
other
insult
without
all
reason
where
gentry
title
wisdom
cannot
conclude
but
by
the
yea
and
no
of
general
ignorance
it
must
omit
real
necessities
and
give
way
the
while
to
unstable
slightness
purpose
so
barrd
it
follows
nothing
is
done
to
purpose
therefore
beseech
you
you
that
will
be
less
fearful
than
discreet
that
love
the
fundamental
part
of
state
more
than
you
doubt
the
change
on
t
that
prefer
a
noble
life
before
a
long
and
wish
to
jump
a
body
with
a
dangerous
physic
thats
sure
of
death
without
it
at
once
pluck
out
the
multitudinous
tongue
let
them
not
lick
the
sweet
which
is
their
poison
your
dishonour
mangles
true
judgment
and
bereaves
the
state
of
that
integrity
which
should
become
it
not
having
the
power
to
do
the
good
it
would
for
the
ill
which
doth
control
t
he
has
said
enough
he
has
spoken
like
a
traitor
and
shall
answer
as
traitors
do
thou
wretch
despite
oerwhelm
thee
what
should
the
people
do
with
these
bald
tribunes
on
whom
depending
their
obedience
fails
to
the
greater
bench
in
a
rebellion
when
whats
not
meet
but
what
must
be
was
law
then
were
they
chosen
in
a
better
hour
let
what
is
meet
be
said
it
must
be
meet
and
throw
their
power
i
the
dust
manifest

trident
or
jove
for
s
power
to
thunder
his
hearts
his
mouth
what
his
breast
forges
that
his

and
being
angry

that

heres
goodly

what
the

where

this
viper
that
would
depopulate
the
city
and
be
every
man
himself
you
worthy
tribunes
he
shall
be
thrown
down
the
tarpeian
rock
with
rigorous
hands
he
hath
resisted
law
and
therefore
law
shall
scorn
him
further
trial
than
the
severity
of
the
public
power
which
he
so
sets
at
nought
he
shall
well
know
the
noble
tribunes
are
the

a
word
or
two
the
which
shall
turn
you
to
no
further
harm
than
so
much
loss
of
time
speak
briefly
then
for
we
are
peremptory
to
dispatch
this
viperous
traitor
to
eject
him
hence
were
but
one
danger
and
to
keep
him
here
our
certain
death
therefore
it
is
decreed
he
dies
tonight
now
the
good
gods
forbid
that
our
renowned
rome
whose
gratitude
towards
her
deserved
children
is
enrolld
in
joves
own
book
like
an
unnatural
dam
should
now
eat
up
her
own
hes
a
disease
that
must
be
cut
away
o
hes
a
limb
that
has
but
a
disease
mortal
to
cut
it
off
to
cure
it
easy
what
has
he
done
to
rome
thats
worthy
death
killing
our
enemies
the
blood
he
hath
lost
which
i
dare
vouch
is
more
than
that
he
hath
by
many
an
ounce
he
droppd
it
for
his
country
and
what
is
left
to
lose
it
by
his
country
were
to
us
all
that
dot
and
suffer
it
a
brand
to
th
end
o
the
world
this
is
clean
kam
merely
awry
when
he
did
love
his
country
it
honourd
him
the
service
of
the
foot
being
once
gangrend
is
not
then
respected
for
what
before
it
was
well
hear
no
more
pursue
him
to
his
house
and
pluck
him
thence
lest
his
infection
being
of
catching
nature
spread
further
one
word
more
one
word
this
tigerfooted
rage
when
it
shall
find
the
harm
of
unscannd
swiftness
will
too
late
tie
leaden
pounds
tos
heels
proceed
by
process
lest
parties
as
he
is
belovd
break
out
and
sack
great
rome
with
romans
if
twere
so
what
do
ye
talk
have
we
not
had
a
taste
of
his
obedience
our
diles
smote
ourselves
resisted
come
consider
this
he
has
been
bred
i
the
wars
since
he
could
draw
a
sword
and
is
ill
schoold
in
bolted
language
meal
and
bran
together
he
throws
without
distinction
give
me
leave
ill
go
to
him
and
undertake
to
bring
him
where
he
shall
answer
by
a
lawful
form
in
peace
to
his
utmost
peril
noble
tribunes
it
is
the
humane
way
the
other
course
will
prove
too
bloody
and
the
end
of
it
unknown
to
the
beginning
noble
menenius
be
you
then
as
the
peoples
officer
masters
lay
down
your
weapons
go
not
home
meet
on
the
marketplace
well
attend
you
there
where
if
you
bring
not
marcius
well
proceed
in
our
first
way
ill
bring
him
to
you
let
me
desire
your
company
he
must
come
or
what
is
worst
will
follow
pray
you
lets
to
him
let
them
pull
all
about
mine
ears
present
me
death
on
the
wheel
or
at
wild
horses
heels
or
pile
ten
hills
on
the
tarpeian
rock
that
the
precipitation
might
down
stretch
below
the
beam
of
sight
yet
will
i
still
be
thus
to
them
you
do
the
nobler
i
muse
my
mother
does
not
approve
me
further
who
was
wont
to
call
them
woollen
vassals
things
created
to
buy
and
sell
with
groats
to
show
bare
heads
in
congregations
to
yawn
be
still
and
wonder
when
one
but
of
my
ordinance
stood
up
to
speak
of
peace
or
war
i
talk
of
you
why
did
you
wish
me
milder
would
you
have
me
false
to
my
nature
rather
say
i
play
the
man
i
am
o
sir
sir
sir
i
would
have
had
you
put
your
power
well
on
before
you
had
worn
it
out
let
go
you
might
have
been
enough
the
man
you
are
with
striving
less
to
be
so
lesser
had
been
the
thwarting
of
your
dispositions
if
you
had
not
showd
them
how
you
were
disposd
ere
they
lackd
power
to
cross
you
let
them
hang
ay
and
burn
too
come
come
you
have
been
too
rough
something
too
rough
you
must
return
and
mend
it
theres
no
remedy
unless
by
not
so
doing
our
good
city
cleave
in
the
midst
and
perish
pray
be
counselld
i
have
a
heart
of
mettle
apt
as
yours
but
yet
a
brain
that
leads
my
use
of
anger
to
better
vantage
well
said
noble
woman
before
he
should
thus
stoop
to
the
herd
but
that
the
violent
fit
o
the
time
craves
it
as
physic
for
the
whole
state
i
would
put
mine
armour
on
which
i
can
scarcely
bear
what
must
i
do
return
to
the
tribunes
well
what
then
what
then
repent
what
you
have
spoke
for
them
i
cannot
do
it
to
the
gods
must
i
then
dot
to
them
you
are
too
absolute
though
therein
you
can
never
be
too
noble
but
when
extremities
speak
i
have
heard
you
say
honour
and
policy
like
unseverd
friends
i
the
war
do
grow
together
grant
that
and
tell
me
in
peace
what
each
of
them
by
th
other
lose
that
they
combine
not
there
tush
tush
a
good
demand
if
it
be
honour
in
your
wars
to
seem
the
same
you
are
not
which
for
your
best
ends
you
adopt
your
policy
how
is
it
less
or
worse
that
it
shall
hold
companionship
in
peace
with
honour
as
in
war
since
that
to
both
it
stands
in
like
request
why
force
you
this
because
that
now
it
lies
you
on
to
speak
to
the
people
not
by
your
own
instruction
nor
by
the
matter
which
your
heart
prompts
you
but
with
such
words
that
are
but
rooted
in
your
tongue
though
but
bastards
and
syllables
of
no
allowance
to
your
bosoms
truth
now
this
no
more
dishonours
you
at
all
than
to
take
in
a
town
with
gentle
words
which
else
would
put
you
to
your
fortune
and
the
hazard
of
much
blood
i
would
dissemble
with
my
nature
where
my
fortunes
and
my
friends
at
stake
requird
i
should
do
so
in
honour
i
am
in
this
your
wife
your
son
these
senators
the
nobles
and
you
will
rather
show
our
general
louts
how
you
can
frown
than
spend
a
fawn
upon
em
for
the
inheritance
of
their
loves
and
safeguard
of
what
that
want
might
ruin
noble
lady
come
go
with
us
speak
fair
you
may
salve
so
not
what
is
dangerous
present
but
the
loss
of
what
is
past
i
prithee
now
my
son
go
to
them
with
this
bonnet
in
thy
hand
and
thus
far
having
stretchd
it
here
be
with
them
thy
knee
bussing
the
stones
for
in
such
business
action
is
eloquence
and
the
eyes
of
the
ignorant
more
learned
than
the
ears
waving
thy
head
which
often
thus
correcting
thy
stout
heart
now
humble
as
the
ripest
mulberry
that
will
not
hold
the
handling
or
say
to
them
thou
art
their
soldier
and
being
bred
in
broils
hast
not
the
soft
way
which
thou
dost
confess
were
fit
for
thee
to
use
as
they
to
claim
in
asking
their
good
loves
but
thou
wilt
frame
thyself
forsooth
hereafter
theirs
so
far
as
thou
hast
power
and
person
this
but
done
even
as
she
speaks
why
their
hearts
were
yours
for
they
have
pardons
being
askd
as
free
as
words
to
little
purpose
prithee
now
go
and
be
ruld
although
i
know
thou
hadst
rather
follow
thine
enemy
in
a
fiery
gulf
than
flatter
him
in
a
bower
here
is
cominius
i
have
been
i
the
marketplace
and
sir
tis
fit
you
make
strong
party
or
defend
yourself
by
calmness
or
by
absence
alls
in
anger
only
fair
speech
i
think
twill
serve
if
he
can
thereto
frame
his
spirit
he
must
and
will
prithee
now
say
you
will
and
go
about
it
must
i
go
show
them
my
unbarbed
sconce
must
i
with
my
base
tongue
give
to
my
noble
heart
a
lie
that
it
must
bear
well
i
will
dot
yet
were
there
but
this
single
plot
to
lose
this
mould
of
marcius
they
to
dust
should
grind
it
and
throw
t
against
the
wind
to
the
marketplace
you
have
put
me
now
to
such
a
part
which
never
i
shall
discharge
to
the
life
come
come
well
prompt
you
i
prithee
now
sweet
son
as
thou
hast
said
my
praises
made
thee
first
a
soldier
so
to
have
my
praise
for
this
perform
a
part
thou
hast
not
done
before
well
i
must
do

shall
be
so
i
the
right
and
strength
o

insisting
on
the
old
prerogative
and
power
i
the
truth

i
shall
inform

and
when
such
time
they
have
begun
to
cry
let
them
not
cease
but
with
a
din
confusd
enforce
the
present
execution
of
what
we
chance
to
sentence
very
well
make
them
be
strong
and
ready
for
this
hint
when
we
shall
hap
to
give
t
them
go
about
it
put
him
to
choler
straight
he
hath
been
usd
ever
to
conquer
and
to
have
his
worth
of
contradiction
being
once
chafd
he
cannot
be
reind
again
to
temperance
then
he
speaks
whats
in
his
heart
and
that
is
there
which
looks
with
us
to
break
his
neck
well
here
he
comes
calmly
i
do
beseech
you
ay
as
an
ostler
that
for
the
poorest
piece
will
bear
the
knave
by
the
volume
the
honourd
gods
keep
rome
in
safety
and
the
chairs
of
justice
supplied
with
worthy
men
plant
love
among
us
throng
our
large
temples
with
the
shows
of
peace
and
not
our
streets
with
war
amen
amen
a
noble
wish
draw
near
ye
people
list
to
your
tribunes
audience
peace
i
say
first
hear
me
speak
well
say
peace
ho
shall
i
be
chargd
no
further
than
this
present
must
all
determine
here
i
do
demand
if
you
submit
you
to
the
peoples
voices
allow
their
officers
and
are
content
to
suffer
lawful
censure
for
such
faults
as
shall
be
provd
upon
you
i
am
content
lo
citizens
he
says
he
is
content
the
warlike
service
he
has
done
consider
think
upon
the
wounds
his
body
bears
which
show
like
graves
i
the
holy
churchyard
scratches
with
briers
scars
to
move
laughter
only
consider
further
that
when
he
speaks
not
like
a
citizen
you
find
him
like
a
soldier
do
not
take
his
rougher
accents
for
malicious
sounds
but
as
i
say
such
as
become
a
soldier
rather
than
envy
you
well
well
no
more
what
is
the
matter
that
being
passd
for
consul
with
full
voice
i
am
so
dishonourd
that
the
very
hour
you
take
it
off
again
answer
to
us
say
then
tis
true
i
ought
so
we
charge
you
that
you
have
contrivd
to
take
from
rome
all
seasond
office
and
to
wind
yourself
into
a
power
tyrannical
for
which
you
are
a
traitor
to
the
people
how
traitor
nay
temperately
your
promise
the
fires
i
the
lowest
hell
foldin
the
people
call
me
their
traitor
thou
injurious
tribune
within
thine
eyes
sat
twenty
thousand
deaths
in
thy
hands
clutchd
as
many
millions
in
thy
lying
tongue
both
numbers
i
would
say
thou
liest
unto
thee
with
a
voice
as
free
as
i
do
pray
the
gods
mark
you
this
people
to
the
rock
to
the
rock
with
him
peace
we
need
not
put
new
matter
to
his
charge
what
you
have
seen
him
do
and
heard
him
speak
beating
your
officers
cursing
yourselves
opposing
laws
with
strokes
and
here
defying
those
whose
great
power
must
try
him
even
this
so
criminal
and
in
such
capital
kind
deserves
the
extremest
death
but
since
he
hath
servd
well
for
rome
what
do
you
prate
of
service
i
talk
of
that
that
know
it
you
is
this
the
promise
that
you
made
your
mother
know
i
pray
you
ill
know
no
further
let
them
pronounce
the
steep
tarpeian
death
vagabond
exile
flaying
pent
to
linger
but
with
a
grain
a
day
i
would
not
buy
their
mercy
at
the
price
of
one
fair
word
nor
check
my
courage
for
what
they
can
give
to
have
t
with
saying
good
morrow
for
that
he
has
as
much
as
in
him
lies
from
time
to
time
envied
against
the
people
seeking
means
to
pluck
away
their
power
as
now
at
last
given
hostile
strokes
and
that
not
in
the
presence
of
dreaded
justice
but
on
the
ministers
that
do
distribute
it
in
the
name
o
the
people
and
in
the
power
of
us
the
tribunes
we
even
from
this
instant
banish
him
our
city
in
peril
of
precipitation
from
off
the
rock
tarpeian
never
more
to
enter
our
rome
gates
i
the
peoples
name
i
say
it
shall
be
so
it
shall
be
so
it
shall
be
so

and
it
shall
be
so

her
enemies
marks
upon
me
i
do
love
my
countrys
good
with
a
respect
more
tender
more
holy
and
profound
than
mine
own
life
my
dear
wifes
estimate
her
wombs
increase
and
treasure
of
my
loins
then

rotten
fens

loves
i
prize
as
the
dead
carcases
of
unburied
men
that
do
corrupt
my
air
i
banish
you
and
here
remain
with
your
uncertainty
let
every
feeble
rumour
shake
your
hearts
your
enemies
with
nodding
of
their
plumes
fan
you
into
despair
have
the
power
still
to
banish
your
defenders
till
at
length
your
ignorance
which
finds
not
till
it
feels
making
but
reservation
of
yourselves
still
your
own
foes
deliver
you
as
most
abated
captives
to
some
nation
that
won
you
without
blows
despising
for
you

worthy
coriolanus
that

to
thine

name
thou
hast
a
grim
appearance

caius
marcius
who
hath
done
to
thee
particularly
and
to
all
the
volsces
great
hurt
and
mischief
thereto
witness
may
my
surname
coriolanus
the
painful
service
the
extreme
dangers
and
the
drops
of
blood
shed
for
my
thankless
country
are
requited
but
with
that
surname
a
good
memory
and
witness
of
the
malice
and
displeasure
which
thou
shouldst
bear
me
only
that
name
remains
the
cruelty
and
envy
of
the
people
permitted
by
our
dastard
nobles
who
have
all
forsook
me
hath
devourd
the
rest
and
sufferd
me
by
the
voice
of
slaves
to
be
whoopd
out
of
rome
now
this
extremity
hath
brought
me
to
thy
hearth
not
out
of
hope
mistake
me
not
to
save
my
life
for
if
i
had
feard
death
of
all
the
men
i
the
world
i
would
have
voided
thee
but
in
mere
spite
to
be
full
quit
of
those
my
banishers
stand
i
before
thee
here
then
if
thou
hast
a
heart
of
wreak
in
thee
that
will
revenge
thine
own
particular
wrongs
and
stop
those
maims
of
shame
seen
through
thy
country
speed
thee
straight
and
make
my
misery
serve
thy
turn
so
use
it
that
my
revengeful
services
may
prove
as
benefits
to
thee
for
i
will
fight
against
my
cankerd
country
with
the
spleen
of
all
the
under
fiends
but
if
so
be
thou
darst
not
this
and
that
to
prove
more
fortunes
thou
art
tird
then
in
a
word
i
also
am
longer
to
live
most
weary
and
present
my
throat
to
thee
and
to
thy
ancient
malice
which
not
to
cut
would
show
thee
but
a
fool
since
i
have
ever
followd
thee
with
hate
drawn
tuns
of
blood
out
of
thy
countrys
breast
and
cannot
live
but
to
thy
shame
unless
it
be
to
do
thee
service
o
marcius
marcius
each
word
thou
hast
spoke
hath
weeded
from
my
heart
a
root
of
ancient
envy
if
jupiter
should
from
yond
cloud
speak
divine
things
and
say
tis
true
id
not
believe
them
more
than
thee
all
noble
marcius
let
me
twine
mine
arms
about
that
body
where
against
my
grained
ash
a
hundred
times
hath
broke
and
scarrd
the
moon
with
splinters
here
i
clip
the
anvil
of
my
sword
and
do
contest
as
hotly
and
as
nobly
with
thy
love
as
ever
in
ambitious
strength
i
did
contend
against
thy
valour
know
thou
first
i
lovd
the
maid
i
married
never
man
sighd
truer
breath
but
that
i
see
thee
here
thou
noble
thing
more
dances
my
rapt
heart
than
when
i
first
my
wedded
mistress
saw
bestride
my
threshold
why
thou
mars
i
tell
thee
we
have
a
power
on
foot
and
i
had
purpose
once
more
to
hew
thy
target
from
thy
brawn
or
lose
mine
arm
for
t
thou
hast
beat
me
out
twelve
several
times
and
i
have
nightly
since
dreamt
of
encounters
twixt
thyself
and
me
we
have
been
down
together
in
my
sleep
unbuckling
helms
fisting
each
others
throat
and
wakd
half
dead
with
nothing
worthy
marcius
had
we
no
quarrel
else
to
rome
but
that
thou
art
thence
banishd
we
would
muster
all
from
twelve
to
seventy
and
pouring
war
into
the
bowels
of
ungrateful
rome
like
a
bold
flood
oerbear
o
come
go
in
and
take
our
friendly
senators
by
the
hands
who
now
are
here
taking
their
leaves
of
me
who
am
prepard
against
your
territories
though
not
for
rome
itself
you
bless
me
gods
therefore
most
absolute
sir
if
thou
wilt
have
the
leading
of
thine
own
revenges
take
the
one
half
of
my
commission
and
set
down
as
best
thou
art
experiencd
since
thou
knowst
thy
countrys
strength
and
weakness
thine
own
ways
whether
to
knock
against
the
gates
of
rome
or
rudely
visit
them
in
parts
remote
to
fright
them
ere
destroy
but
come
in
let
me
commend
thee
first
to
those
that
shall
say
yea
to
thy
desires
a
thousand
welcomes
and
more
a
friend
than
eer
an
enemy
yet
marcius
that
was
much
your
hand
most
welcome
heres
a
strange
alteration
by
my
hand
i
had
thought
to
have
strucken
him
with
a
cudgel
and
yet
my
mind
gave
me
his
clothes
made
a
false
report
of
him
what
an
arm
he
has
he
turned
me
about
with
his
finger
and
his
thumb
as
one
would
set
up
a
top
nay
i
knew
by
his
face
that
there
was
something
in
him
he
had
sir
a
kind
of
face
methought
i
cannot
tell
how
to
term
it
he
had
so
looking
as
it
were
would
i
were
hanged
but
i
thought
there
was
more
in
him
than
i
could
think
so
did
i
ill
be
sworn
he
is
simply
the
rarest
man
i
the
world
i
think
he
is
but
a
greater
soldier
than
he
you
wot
on
who
my
master
nay
its
no
matter
for
that
worth
six
on
him
nay
not
so
neither
but
i
take
him
to
be
the
greater
soldier
faith
look
you
one
cannot
tell
how
to
say
that
for
the
defence
of
a
town
our
general
is
excellent
ay
and
for
an
assault
too
o
slaves
i
can
tell
you
news
news
you
rascals
what
what
what
lets
partake
what
what
what
lets
partake
i
would
not
be
a
roman
of
all
nations
i
had
as
lief
be
a
condemned
man
wherefore
wherefore
wherefore
wherefore
why
heres
he
that
was
wont
to
thwack
our
general
caius
marcius
why
do
you
say
thwack
our
general
i
do
not
say
thwack
our
general
but
he
was
always
good
enough
for
him
come
we
are
fellows
and
friends
he
was
ever
too
hard
for
him
i
have
heard
him
say
so
himself
he
was
too
hard
for
him
directly
to
say
the
truth
on
t
before
corioli
he
scotched
him
and
notched
him
like
a
carbonado
an
he
had
been
cannibally
given
he
might
have
broiled
and
eaten
him
too
but
more
of
thy
news
why
he
is
so
made
on
here
within
as
if
he
were
son
and
heir
to
mars
set
at
upper
end
o
the
table
no
question
asked
him
by
any
of
the
senators
but
they
stand
bald
before
him
our
general
himself
makes
a
mistress
of
him
sanctifies
himself
with
s
hand
and
turns
up
the
white
o
the
eye
to
his
discourse
but
the
bottom
of
the
news
is
our
general
is
out
i
the
middle
and
but
one
half
of
what
he
was
yesterday
for
the
other
has
half
by
the
entreaty
and
grant
of
the
whole
table
hell
go
he
says
and
sowle
the
porter
of
rome
gates
by
the
ears
he
will
mow
down
all
before
him
and
leave
his
passage
polled
and
hes
as
like
to
do
t
as
any
man
i
can
imagine
do
t
he
will
do
t
for
look
you
sir
he
has
as
many
friends
as
enemies
which
friends
sir
as
it
were
durst
not
look
you
sir
show
themselves
as
we
term
it
his
friends
whilst
hes
in
directitude
directitude
whats
that
but
when
they
shall
see
sir
his
crest
up
again
and
the
man
in
blood
they
will
out
of
their
burrows
like
comes
after
rain
and
revel
all
with
him
but
when
goes
this
forward
tomorrow
today
presently
you
shall
have
the
drum
struck
up
this
afternoon
tis
as
it
were
a
parcel
of
their
feast
and
to
be
executed
ere
they
wipe
their
lips
why
then
we
shall
have
a
stirring
world
again
this
peace
is
nothing
but
to
rust
iron
increase
tailors
and
breed
balladmakers
let
me
have
war
say
i
it
exceeds
peace
as
far
as
day
does
night
its
spritely
waking
audible
and
full
of
vent
peace
is
a
very
apoplexy
lethargy
mulled
deaf
sleepy
insensible
a
getter
of
more
bastard
children
than
wars
a
destroyer
of
men
tis
so
and
as
war
in
some
sort
may
be
said
to
be
a
ravisher
so
it
cannot
be
denied
but
peace
is
a
great
maker
of
cuckolds
ay
and
it
makes
men
hate
one
another
reason
because
they
then
less
need
one
another
the
wars
for
my
money
i
hope
to
see
romans
as
cheap
as
volscians
they
are
rising
they
are
rising
in
in
in
in
we
hear
not
of
him
neither
need
we
fear
him
his
remedies
are
tame
i
the
present
peace
and
quietness
o
the
people
which
before
were
in
wild
hurry
here
do
we
make
his
friends
blush
that
the
world
goes
well
who
rather
had
though
they
themselves
did
suffer
by
t
behold
dissentious
numbers
pestering
streets
than
see
our
tradesmen
singing
in
their
shops
and
going
about
their
functions
friendly
we
stood
to
t
in
good
time
is
this
menenius
tis
he
tis
he
o
he
is
grown
most
kind
of
late
hail
sir
hail
to
you
both
your
coriolanus
is
not
much
missd
but
with
his
friends
the
commonwealth
doth
stand
and
so
would
do
were
he
more
angry
at
it
alls
well
and
might
have
been
much
better
if
he
could
have
temporizd
where
is
he
hear
you
nay
i
hear
nothing
his
mother
and
his
wife
hear
nothing
from
him
the
gods
preserve
you
both
good
den
our
neighbours
good
den
to
you
all
good
den
to
you
all
ourselves
our
wives
and
children
on
our
knees
are
bound
to
pray
for
you
both
live
and
thrive
farewell
kind
neighbours
we
wishd
coriolanus
had
lovd
you
as
we
did
now
the
gods
keep
you
farewell
farewell
farewell
farewell
this
is
a
happier
and
more
comely
time
than
when
these
fellows
ran
about
the
streets
crying
confusion
caius
marcius
was
a
worthy
officer
i
the
war
but
insolent
oercome
with
pride
ambitious
past
all
thinking
selfloving
and
affecting
one
sole
throne
without
assistance
i
think
not
so
we
should
by
this
to
all
our
lamentation
if
he
had
gone
forth
consul
found
it
so
the
gods
have
well
prevented
it
and
rome
sits
safe
and
still
without
him
worthy
tribunes
there
is
a
slave
whom
we
have
put
in
prison
reports
the
volsces
with
two
several
powers
are
enterd
in
the
roman
territories
and
with
the
deepest
malice
of
the
war
destroy
what
lies
before
them
tis
aufidius
who
hearing
of
our
marcius
banishment
thrusts
forth
his
horns
again
into
the
world
which
were
inshelld
when
marcius
stood
for
rome
and
durst
not
once
peep
out
come
what
talk
you
of
marcius
go
see
this
rumourer
whippd
it
cannot
be
the
volsces
dare
break
with
us
cannot
be
we
have
record
that
very
well
it
can
and
three
examples
of
the
like
have
been
within
my
age
but
reason
with
the
fellow
before
you
punish
him
where
he
heard
this
lest
you
shall
chance
to
whip
your
information
and
beat
the
messenger
who
bids
beware
of
what
is
to
be
dreaded
tell
not
me
i
know
this
cannot
be
not
possible
the
nobles
in
great
earnestness
are
going
all
to
the
senatehouse
some
news
is
come
that
turns
their
countenances
tis
this
slave
go
whip
him
fore
the
peoples
eyes
his
raising
nothing
but
his
report
yes
worthy
sir
the
slaves
report
is
seconded
and
more
more
fearful
is
deliverd
what
more
fearful
it
is
spoke
freely
out
of
many
mouths
how
probable
i
do
not
know
that
marcius
joind
with
aufidius
leads
a
power
gainst
rome
and
vows
revenge
as
spacious
as
between
the
youngst
and
oldest
thing
this
is
most
likely
raisd
only
that
the
weaker
sort
may
wish
good
marcius
home
again
the
very
trick
on
t
this
is
unlikely
he
and
aufidius
can
no
more
atone
than
violentest
contrariety
you
are
sent
for
to
the
senate
a
fearful
army
led
by
caius
marcius
associated
with
aufidius
rages
upon
our
territories
and
have
already
oerborne
their
way
consumd
with
fire
and
took

o

made
good
work
what
news
what
news
you
have
holp
to
ravish
your
own
daughters
and
to
melt
the
city
leads
upon
your
pates
to
see
your
wives
dishonourd
to
your
noses
whats
the
news
whats
the
news
your
temples
burned
in
their
cement
and
your
franchises
whereon
you
stood
confind
into
an
augers
bore
pray
now
your
news
you
have
made
fair
work
i
fear
me
pray
your
news
if
marcius
should
be
joind
with
volscians
if
he
is
their
god
he
leads
them
like
a
thing
made
by
some
other
deity
than
nature
that
shapes
man
better
and
they
follow
him
against
us
brats
with
no
less
confidence
than
boys
pursuing
summer
butterflies
or
butchers
killing
flies
you
have
made
good
work
you
and
your
apronmen
you
that
stood
so
much
upon
the
voice
of
occupation
and
the
breath
of
garliceaters
he
will
shake
your
rome
about
your
ears
as
hercules
did
shake
down
mellow
fruit
you
have
made
fair
work
but
is
this
true
sir
ay
and
youll
look
pale
before
you
find
it
other
all
the
regions
do
smilingly
revolt
and
who
resist
are
mockd
for
valiant
ignorance
and
perish
constant
fools
who
ist
can
blame
him
your
enemies
and
his
find
something
in
him
we
are
all
undone
unless
the
noble
man
have
mercy
who
shall
ask
it
the
tribunes
cannot
dot
for
shame
the
people
deserve
such
pity
of
him
as
the
wolf
does
of
the
shepherds
for
his
best
friends
if
they
should
say
be
good
to
rome
they
chargd
him
even
as
those
should
do
that
had
deservd
his
hate
and
therein
showd
like
enemies
tis
true
if
he
were
putting
to
my
house
the
brand
that
should
consume
it
i
have
not
the
face
to
say
beseech
you
cease
you
have
made
fair
hands
you
and
your
crafts
you
have
crafted
fair
you
have
brought
a
trembling
upon
rome
such
as
was
never
so
incapable
of
help
say
not
we
brought
it
say
not
we
brought
it
how
was
it
we
we
lovd
him
but
like
beasts
and
cowardly
nobles
gave
way
unto
your
clusters
who
did
hoot
him
out
o
the
city
but
i
fear
theyll
roar
him
in
again
tullus
aufidius
the
second
name
of
men
obeys
his
points
as
if
he
were
his
officer
desperation
is
all
the
policy
strength
and
defence
that
rome
can
make
against
them
here
come
the
clusters
and
is
aufidius
with
him
you
are
they
that
made
the
air
unwholesome
when
you
cast
your
stinking
greasy
caps
in
hooting
at
coriolanus
exile
now
hes
coming
and
not
a
hair
upon
a
soldiers
head
which
will
not
prove
a
whip
as
many
coxcombs
as
you
threw
caps
up
will
he
tumble
down
and
pay
you
for
your
voices
tis
no
matter
if
he
could
burn
us
all
into
one
coal
we
have
deservd
it
faith
we
hear
fearful
news
for
mine
own
part
when
i
said
banish
him
i
said
twas
pity
and
so
did
i
and
so
did
i
and
to
say
the
truth
so
did
very
many
of
us
that
we
did
we
did
for
the
best
and
though
we
willingly
consented
to
his
banishment
yet
it
was
against
our
will
youre
goodly
things
you
voices
you
have
made
good
work
you
and
your
cry
shalls
to
the
capitol
o
ay
what
else
go
masters
get
you
home
be
not
dismayd
these
are
a
side
that
would
be
glad
to
have
this
true
which
they
so
seem
to
fear
go
home
and
show
no
sign
of
fear
the
gods
be
good
to
us
come
masters
lets
home
i
ever
said
we
were
i
the
wrong
when
we
banished
him
so
did
we
all
but
come
lets
home
i
do
not
like
this
news
nor
i
lets
to
the
capitol
would
half
my
wealth
would
buy
this
for
a
lie
pray
let
us
go
do
they
still
fly
to
the
roman
i
do
not
know
what
witchcrafts
in
him
but
your
soldiers
use
him
as
the
grace
fore
meat
their
talk
at
table
and
their
thanks
at
end
and
you
are
darkend
in
this
action
sir
even
by
your
own
i
cannot
help
it
now
unless
by
using
means
i
lame
the
foot
of
our
design
he
bears
himself
more
proudlier
even
to
my
person
than
i
thought
he
would
when
first
i
did
embrace
him
yet
his
nature
in
thats
no
changeling
and
i
must
excuse
what
cannot
be
amended
yet
i
wish
sir
i
mean
for
your
particular
you
had
not
joind
in
commission
with
him
but
either
had
borne
the
action
of
yourself
or
else
to
him
had
left
it
solely
i
understand
thee
well
and
be
thou
sure
when
he
shall
come
to
his
account
he
knows
not
what
i
can
urge
against
him
although
it
seems
and
so
he
thinks
and
is
no
less
apparent
to
the
vulgar
eye
that
he
bears
all
things
fairly
and
shows
good
husbandry
for
the
volscian
state
fights
dragonlike
and
does
achieve
as
soon
as
draw
his
sword
yet
he
hath
left
undone
that
which
shall
break
his
neck
or
hazard
mine
wheneer
we
come
to
our
account
sir
i
beseech
you
think
you
hell
carry
rome
all
places
yield
to
him
ere
he
sits
down
and
the
nobility
of
rome
are
his
the
senators
and
patricians
love
him
too
the
tribunes
are
no
soldiers
and
their
people
will
be
as
rash
in
the
repeal
as
hasty
to
expel
him
thence
i
think
hell
be
to
rome
as
is
the
osprey
to
the
fish
who
takes
it
by
sovereignty
of
nature
first
he
was
a
noble
servant
to
them
but
he
could
not
carry
his
honours
even
whether
twas
pride
which
out
of
daily
fortune
ever
taints
the
happy
man
whether
defect
of
judgment
to
fail
in
the
disposing
of
those
chances
which
he
was
lord
of
or
whether
nature
not
to
be
other
than
one
thing
not
moving
from
the
casque
to
the
cushion
but
commanding
peace
even
with
the
same
austerity
and
garb
as
he
controlld
the
war
but
one
of
these
as
he
hath
spices
of
them
all
not
all
for
i
dare
so
far
free
him
made
him
feard
so
hated
and
so
banishd
but
he
has
a
merit
to
choke
it
in
the
utterance
so
our
virtues
lie
in
the
interpretation
of
the
time
and
power
unto
itself
most
commendable
hath
not
a
tomb
so
evident
as
a
chair
to
extol
what
it
hath
done
one
fire
drives
out
one
fire
one
nail
one
nail
rights
by
rights
falter
strengths
by
strengths
do
fail
come
lets
away
when
caius
rome
is
thine
thou
art
poorst
of
all
then
shortly
art
thou
mine
no
ill
not
go
you
hear
what
he
hath
said
which
was
sometime
his
general
who
lovd
him
in
a
most
dear
particular
he
calld
me
father
but
what
o
that
go
you
that
banishd
him
a
mile
before
his
tent
fall
down
and
knee
the
way
into
his
mercy
nay
if
he
coyd
to
hear
cominius
speak
ill
keep
at
home
he
would
not
seem
to
know
me
do
you
hear
yet
one
time
he
did
call
me
by
my
name
i
urgd
our
old
acquaintance
and
the
drops
that
we
have
bled
together
coriolanus
he
would
not
answer
to
forbad
all
names
he
was
a
kind
of
nothing
titleless
till
he
had
forgd
himself
a
name
o
the
fire
of
burning
rome
why
so
you
have
made
good
work
a
pair
of
tribunes
that
have
rackd
for
rome
to
make
coals
cheap
a
noble
memory
i
minded
him
how
royal
twas
to
pardon
when
it
was
less
expected
he
replied
it
was
a
bare
petition
of
a
state
to
one
whom
they
had
punishd
very
well
could
he
say
less
i
offerd
to
awaken
his
regard
fors
private
friends
his
answer
to
me
was
he
could
not
stay
to
pick
them
in
a
pile
of
noisome
musty
chaff
he
said
twas
folly
for
one
poor
grain
or
two
to
leave
unburnt
and
still
to
nose
the
offence
for
one
poor
grain
or
two
i
am
one
of
those
his
mother
wife
his
child
and
this
brave
fellow
too
we
are
the
grains
you
are
the
musty
chaff
and
you
are
smelt
above
the
moon
we
must
be
burnt
for
you
nay
pray
be
patient
if
you
refuse
your
aid
in
this
soneverneeded
help
yet
do
not
upbraids
with
our
distress
but
sure
if
you
would
be
your
countrys
pleader
your
good
tongue
more
than
the
instant
army
we
can
make
might
stop
our
countryman
no
ill
not
meddle
pray
you
go
to
him
what
should
i
do
only
make
trial
what
your
love
can
do
for
rome
towards
marcius
well
and
say
that
marcius
return
me
as
cominius
is
returnd
unheard
what
then
but
as
a
discontented
friend
griefshot
with
his
unkindness
say
t
be
so
yet
your
good
will
must
have
that
thanks
from
rome
after
the
measure
as
you
intended
well
ill
undertake
it
i
think
hell
hear
me
yet
to
bite
his
lip
and
hum
at
good
cominius
much
unhearts
me
he
was
not
taken
well
he
had
not
dind
the
veins
unfilld
our
blood
is
cold
and
then
we
pout
upon
the
morning
are
unapt
to
give
or
to
forgive
but
when
we
have
stuffd
these
pipes
and
these
conveyances
of
our
blood
with
wine
and
feeding
we
have
suppler
souls
than
in
our
priestlike
fasts
therefore
ill
watch
him
till
he
be
dieted
to
my
request
and
then
ill
set
upon
him
you
know
the
very
road
into
his
kindness
and
cannot
lose
your
way
good
faith
ill
prove
him
speed
how
it
will
i
shall
ere
long
have
knowledge
of
my
success
hell
never
hear
him
not
i
tell
you
he
does
sit
in
gold
his
eye
red
as
twould
burn
rome
and
his
injury
the
gaoler
to
his
pity
i
kneeld
before
him
twas
very
faintly
he
said
rise
dismissd
me
thus
with
his
speechless
hand
what
he
would
do
he
sent
in
writing
after
me
what
he
would
not
bound
with
an
oath
to
yield
to
his
conditions
so
that
all
hope
is
vain
unless
his
noble
mother
and
his
wife
who
as
i
hear
mean
to
solicit
him
for
mercy
to
his
country
therefore
lets
hence
and
with
our
fair
entreaties
haste
them
on
stay
whence
are
you
stand
and
go
back
you
guard
like
men
tis
well
but
by
your
leave
i
am
an
officer
of
state
and
come
to
speak
with
coriolanus
from
whence
from
rome
you
may
not
pass
you
must
return
our
general
will
no
more
hear
from
thence
youll
see
your
rome
embracd
with
fire
before
youll
speak
with
coriolanus
good
my
friends
if
you
have
heard
your
general
talk
of
rome
and
of
his
friends
there
it
is
lots
to
blanks
my
name
hath
touchd
your
ears
it
is
menenius
be
it
so
go
back
the
virtue
of
your
name
is
not
here
passable
i
tell
thee
fellow
thy
general
is
my
lover
i
have
been
the
book
of
his
good
acts
whence
men
have
read
his
fame
unparalleld
haply
amplified
for
i
have
ever
glorified
my
friends
of
whom
hes
chief
with
all
the
size
that
verity
would
without
lapsing
suffer
nay
sometimes
like
to
a
bowl
upon
a
subtle
ground
i
have
tumbled
past
the
throw
and
in
his
praise
have
almost
stampd
the
leasing
therefore
fellow
i
must
have
leave
to
pass
faith
sir
if
you
had
told
as
many
lies
in
his
behalf
as
you
have
uttered
words
in
your
own
you
should
not
pass
here
no
though
it
were
as
virtuous
to
lie
as
to
live
chastely
therefore
go
back
prithee
fellow
remember
my
name
is
menenius
always
factionary
on
the
party
of
your
general
howsoever
you
have
been
his
liar
as
you
say
you
have
i
am
one
that
telling
true
under
him
must
say
you
cannot
pass
therefore
go
back
has
he
dined
canst
thou
tell
for
i
would
not
speak
with
him
till
after
dinner
you
are
a
roman
are
you
i
am
as
thy
general
is
then
you
should
hate
rome
as
he
does
can
you
when
you
have
pushed
out
your
gates
the
very
defender
of
them
and
in
a
violent
popular
ignorance
given
your
enemy
your
shield
think
to
front
his
revenges
with
the
easy
groans
of
old
women
the
virginal
palms
of
your
daughters
or
with
the
palsied
intercession
of
such
a
decayed
dotant
as
you
seem
to
be
can
you
think
to
blow
out
the
intended
fire
your
city
is
ready
to
flame
in
with
such
weak
breath
as
this
no
you
are
deceived
therefore
back
to
rome
and
prepare
for
your
execution
you
are
condemned
our
general
has
sworn
you
out
of
reprieve
and
pardon

say
an
errand
for
you

shall
know
now

i
am
in

shall
perceive
that
a
jack
guardant
cannot
office
me
from
my
son
coriolanus
guess
but
by
my
entertainment
with
him
if
thou
standest
not
i
the
state
of
hanging
or
of
some
death
more
long
in
spectatorship

never
admitted
a
private
whisper
no
not
with
such
friends
that
thought
them
sure
of
you
this
last
old
man
whom
with
a
crackd
heart
i
have
sent
to
rome
lovd
me
above
the
measure
of
a
father
nay
godded
me
indeed
their
latest
refuge
was
to
send
him
for
whose
old
love
i
have
though
i
showd
sourly
to
him
once
more
offerd
the
first
conditions
which
they
did
refuse
and
cannot
now
accept
to
grace
him
only
that
thought
he
could
do
more
a
very
little
i
have
yielded
to
fresh
embassies
and
suits
nor
from
the
state
nor
private
friends
hereafter
will
i
lend
ear
to
ha
what
shout
is
this
shall
i
be
tempted
to
infringe
my
vow
in
the
same
time
tis
made
i
will
not
my
wife
comes
foremost
then
the
honourd
mould
wherein
this
trunk
was
framd
and
in
her
hand
the
grandchild
to
her
blood
but
out
affection
all
bond
and
privilege
of
nature
break
let
it
be
virtuous
to
be
obstinate
what
is
that
curtsy
worth
or
those
doves
eyes
which
can
make
gods
forsworn
i
melt
and
am
not
of
stronger
earth
than
others
my
mother
bows
as
if
olympus
to
a
molehill
should
in
supplication
nod
and
my
young
boy
hath
an
aspect
of
intercession
which
great
nature
cries
deny
not
let
the
volsces
plough
rome
and
harrow
italy
ill
never
be
such
a
gosling
to
obey
instinct
but
stand
as
if
a
man
were
author
of
himself
and
knew
no
other
kin
my
lord
and
husband
these
eyes
are
not
the
same
i
wore
in
rome
the
sorrow
that
delivers
us
thus
changd
makes
you
think
so
like
a
dull
actor
now
i
have
forgot
my
part
and
i
am
out
even
to
a
full
disgrace
best
of
my
flesh
forgive
my
tyranny
but
do
not
say
for
that
forgive
our
romans
o
a
kiss
long
as
my
exile
sweet
as
my
revenge
now
by
the
jealous
queen
of
heaven
that
kiss
i
carried
from
thee
dear
and
my
true
lip
hath
virgind
it
eer
since
you
gods
i
prate
and
the
most
noble
mother
of
the
world
leave
unsaluted
sink
my
knee
i
the
earth
of
thy
deep
duty
more
impression
show
than
that
of
common
sons
o
stand
up
blessd
whilst
with
no
softer
cushion
than
the
flint
i
kneel
before
thee
and
unproperly
show
duty
as
mistaken
all
this
while
between
the
child
and
parent
what
is
this
your
knees
to
me
to
your
corrected
son
then
let
the
pebbles
on
the
hungry
beach
fillip

stars
then
let
the
mutinous
winds
strike
the
proud
cedars
gainst
the
fiery
sun
murdring
impossibility
to
make
what
cannot
be
slight
work
thou
art
my
warrior
i
holp
to
frame
thee
do
you
know
this
lady
the
noble
sister
of
publicola
the
moon
of
rome
chaste
as
the
icicle
thats
curdied
by
the
frost
from
purest
snow
and
hangs
on
dians
temple
dear
valeria
this
is
a
poor
epitome
of
yours
which
by
the
interpretation
of
full
time
may
show
like
all
yourself
the
god
of
soldiers
with
the
consent
of
supreme
jove
inform
thy
thoughts
with
nobleness
that
thou
mayst
prove
to
shame
unvulnerable
and
stick
i
the
wars
like
a
great
seamark
standing
every
flaw
and
saving
those
that
eye
thee
your
knee
sirrah
thats
my
brave
boy
even
he
your
wife
this
lady
and
myself
are
suitors
to
you
i
beseech
you
peace
or
if
youd
ask
remember
this
before
the
things
i
have
forsworn
to
grant
may
never
be
held
by
you
denials
do
not
bid
me
dismiss
my
soldiers
or
capitulate
again
with
romes
mechanics
tell
me
not
wherein
i
seem
unnatural
desire
not
to
allay
my
rages
and
revenges
with
your
colder
reasons
o
no
more
no
more
you
have
said
you
will
not
grant
us
any
thing
for
we
have
nothing
else
to
ask
but
that
which
you
deny
already
yet
we
will
ask
that
if
you
fail
in
our
request
the
blame
may
hang
upon
your
hardness
therefore
hear
us
aufidius
and
you
volsces
mark
for
well
hear
nought
from
rome
in
private
your
request
should
we
be
silent
and
not
speak
our
raiment
and
state
of
bodies
would
bewray
what
life
we
have
led
since
thy
exile
think
with
thyself
how
more
unfortunate
than
all
living
women
are
we
come
hither
since
that
thy
sight
which
should
make
our
eyes
flow
with
joy
hearts
dance
with
comforts
constrains
them
weep
and
shake
with
fear
and
sorrow
making
the
mother
wife
and
child
to
see
the
son
the
husband
and
the
father
tearing
his
countrys
bowels
out
and
to
poor
we
thine
enmitys
most
capital
thou
barrst
us
our
prayers
to
the
gods
which
is
a
comfort
that
all
but
we
enjoy
for
how
can
we
alas
how
can
we
for
our
country
pray
whereto
we
are
bound
together
with
thy
victory
whereto
we
are
bound
alack
or
we
must
lose
the
country
our
dear
nurse
or
else
thy
person
our
comfort
in
the
country
we
must
find
an
evident
calamity
though
we
had
our
wish
which
side
should
win
for
either
thou
must
as
a
foreign
recreant
be
led
with
manacles
through
our
streets
or
else
triumphantly
tread
on
thy
countrys
ruin
and
bear
the
palm
for
having
bravely
shed
thy
wife
and
childrens
blood
for
myself
son
i
purpose
not
to
wait
on
fortune
till
these
wars
determine
if
i
cannot
persuade
thee
rather
to
show
a
noble
grace
to
both
parts
than
seek
the
end
of
one
thou
shalt
no
sooner
march
to
assault
thy
country
than
to
tread
trust
tot
thou
shalt
not
on
thy
mothers
womb
that
brought
thee
to
this
world
ay
and
mine
that
brought
you
forth
this
boy
to
keep
your
name
living
to
time
a
shall
not
tread
on
me
ill
run
away
till
i
am
bigger
but
then
ill
fight
not
of
a
womans
tenderness
to
be
requires
nor
child
nor
womans
face
to
see
i
have
sat
too
long
nay
go
not
from
us
thus
if
it
were
so
that
our
request
did
tend
to
save
the
romans
thereby
to
destroy
the
volsces
whom
you
serve
you
might
condemn
us
as
poisonous
of
your
honour
no
our
suit
is
that
you
reconcile
them
while
the
volsces
may
say
this
mercy
we
have
showd
the
romans
this
we
receivd
and
each
in
either
side
give
the
allhail
to
thee
and
cry
be
blessd
for
making
up
this
peace
thou
knowst
great
son
the
end
of
wars
uncertain
but
this
certain
that
if
thou
conquer
rome
the
benefit
which
thou
shalt
thereby
reap
is
such
a
name
whose
repetition
will
be
doggd
with
curses
whose
chronicle
thus
writ
the
man
was
noble
but
with
his
last
attempt
he
wipd
it
out
destroyd
his
country
and
his
name
remains
to
the
ensuing
age
abhorrd
speak
to
me
son
thou
hast
affected
the
fine
strains
of
honour
to
imitate
the
graces
of
the
gods
to
tear
with
thunder
the
wide
cheeks
o
the
air
and
yet
to
charge
thy
sulphur
with
a
bolt
that
should
but
rive
an
oak
why
dost
not
speak
thinkst
thou
it
honourable
for
a
noble
man
still
to
remember
wrongs
daughter
speak
you
he
cares
not
for
your
weeping
speak
thou
boy
perhaps
thy
childishness
will
move
him
more
than
can
our
reasons
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
more
bound
to
s
mother
yet
here
he
lets
me
prate
like
one
i
the
stocks
thou
hast
never
in
thy
life
showd
thy
dear
mother
any
courtesy
when
she
poor
hen
fond
of
no
second
brood
has
cluckd
thee
to
the
wars
and
safely
home
loaden
with
honour
say
my
requests
unjust
and
spurn
me
back
but
if
it
be
not
so
thou
art
not
honest
and
the
gods
will
plague
thee
that
thou
restrainst
from
me
the
duty
which
to
a
mothers
part
belongs
he
turns
away
down
ladies
let
us
shame
him
with
our
knees
to
his
surname
coriolanus
longs
more
pride
than
pity
to
our
prayers
down
an
end
this
is
the
last
so
we
will
home
to
rome
and
die
among
our
neighbours
nay
behold
us
this
boy
that
cannot
tell
what
he
would
have
but
kneels
and
holds
up
hands
for
fellowship
does
reason
our
petition
with
more
strength
than
thou
hast
to
deny
t
come
let
us
go
this
fellow
had
a
volscian
to
his
mother
his
wife
is
in
corioli
and
his
child
like
him
by
chance
yet
give
us
our
dispatch

am
hushd
until

afire
and
then

speak
a
little
o
mother

have
you
done

the
heavens

the
gods

down
and
this
unnatural
scene
they
laugh
at
o
my
mother
mother
o
you
have
won
a
happy
victory
to
rome
but
for
your
son
believe
it
o
believe
it
most
dangerously
you
have
with
him
prevaild
if
not
most
mortal
to
him
but
let
it
come
aufidius
though
i
cannot
make
true
wars
ill
frame
convenient
peace
now
good
aufidius
were
you
in
my
stead
would
you
have
heard
a
mother
less
or
granted
less
aufidius
i
was
movd
withal
i
dare
be
sworn
you
were
and
sir
it
is
no
little
thing
to
make
mine
eyes
to
sweat
compassion
but
good
sir
what
peace
youll
make
advise
me
for
my
part
ill
not
to
rome
ill
back
with
you
and
pray
you
stand
to
me
in
this
cause
o
mother
wife
i
am
glad
thou
hast
set
thy
mercy
and
thy
honour
at
difference
in
thee
out
of
that
ill
work
myself
a
former
fortune
ay
by
and
by
but
we
will
drink
together
and
you
shall
bear
a
better
witness
back
than
words
which
we
on
like
conditions
would
have
counterseald
come
enter
with
us
ladies
you
deserve
to
have
a
temple
built
you
all
the
swords
in
italy
and
her
confederate
arms
could
not
have
made
this
peace
see
you
yond
coign
o
the
capitol
yond
cornerstone
why
what
of
that
if
it
be
possible
for
you
to
displace
it
with
your
little
finger
there
is
some
hope
the
ladies
of
rome
especially
his
mother
may
prevail
with
him
but
i
say
there
is
no
hope
in
t
our
throats
are
sentenced
and
stay
upon
execution
ist
possible
that
so
short
a
time
can
alter
the
condition
of
a
man
there
is
differency
between
a
grub
and
a
butterfly
yet
your
butterfly
was
a
grub
this
marcius
is
grown
from
man
to
dragon
he
has
wings
hes
more
than
a
creeping
thing
he
loved
his
mother
dearly
so
did
he
me
and
he
no
more
remembers
his
mother
now
than
an
eightyearold
horse
the
tartness
of
his
face
sours
ripe
grapes
when
he
walks
he
moves
like
an
engine
and
the
ground
shrinks
before
his
treading
he
is
able
to
pierce
a
corslet
with
his
eye
talks
like
a
knell
and
his
hum
is
a
battery
he
sits
in
his
state
as
a
thing
made
for
alexander
what
he
bids
be
done
is
finished
with
his
bidding
he
wants
nothing
of
a
god
but
eternity
and
a
heaven
to
throne
in
yes
mercy
if
you
report
him
truly
i
paint
him
in
the
character
mark
what
mercy
his
mother
shall
bring
from
him
there
is
no
more
mercy
in
him
than
there
is
milk
in
a
male
tiger
that
shall
our
poor
city
find
and
all
this
is
long
of
you
the
gods
be
good
unto
us
no
in
such
a
case
the
gods
will
not
be
good
unto
us
when
we
banished
him
we
respected
not
them
and
he
returning
to
break
our
necks
they
respect
not
us
sir
if
youd
save
your
life
fly
to
your
house
the
plebeians

got
your
fellowtribune
and
hale

vouch
the
truth
of
it
him
i
accuse
the
city

by
this
hath
enterd
and
intends
to
appear
before
the
people
hoping
to
purge
himself
with
words
dispatch
most
welcome
how
is
it
with
our
general
even
so
as
with
a
man
by
his
own
alms
empoisond
and
with
his
charity
slain
most
noble
sir
if
you
do
hold
the
same
intent
wherein
you
wishd
us
parties
well
deliver
you
of
your
great
danger
sir
i
cannot
tell
we
must
proceed
as
we
do
find
the
people
the
people
will
remain
uncertain
whilst
twixt
you
theres
difference
but
the
fall
of
either
makes
the
survivor
heir
of
all
i
know
it
and
my
pretext
to
strike
at
him
admits
a
good
construction
i
raisd
him
and
i
pawnd
mine
honour
for
his
truth
who
being
so
heightend
he
waterd
his
new
plants
with
dews
of
flattery
seducing
so
my
friends
and
to
this
end
he
bowd
his
nature
never
known
before
but
to
be
rough
unswayable
and
free
sir
his
stoutness
when
he
did
stand
for
consul
which
he
lost
by
lack
of
stooping
that
i
would
have
spoke
of
being
banishd
fort
he
came
unto
my
hearth
presented
to
my
knife
his
throat
i
took
him
made
him
jointservant
with
me
gave
him
way
in
all
his
own
desires
nay
let
him
choose
out
of
my
files
his
projects
to
accomplish
my
best
and
freshest
men
servd
his
designments
in
mine
own
person
holp
to
reap
the
fame
which
he
did
end
all
his
and
took
some
pride
to
do
myself
this
wrong
till
at
the
last
i
seemd
his
follower
not
partner
and
he
wagd
me
with
his
countenance
as
if
i
had
been
mercenary
so
he
did
my
lord
the
army
marvelld
at
it
and
in
the
last
when
we
had
carried
rome
and
that
we
lookd
for
no
less
spoil
than
glory
there
was
it
for
which
my
sinews
shall
be
stretchd
upon
him
at
a
few
drops
of
womens
rheum
which
are
as
cheap
as
lies
he
sold
the
blood
and
labour
of
our
great
action
therefore
shall
he
die
and
ill
renew
me
in
his
fall
but
hark
your
native
town
you
enterd
like
a
post
and
had
no
welcomes
home
but
he
returns
splitting
the
air
with
noise
and
patient
fools
whose
children
he
hath
slain
their
base
throats
tear
with
giving
him
glory
therefore
at
your
vantage
ere
he
express
himself
or
move
the
people
with
what
he
would
say
let
him
feel
your
sword
which
we
will
second
when
he
lies
along
after
your

his

with

say
no
more
here
come
the

not
deservd

have
you
with
heed
perusd
what
i
have
written
to
you
we
have
and
grieve
to
hear
t
what
faults
he
made
before
the
last
i
think
might
have
found
easy
fines
but
there
to
end
where
he
was
to
begin
and
give
away
the
benefit
of
our
levies
answering
us
with
our
own
charge
making
a
treaty
where
there
was
a
yielding
this
admits
no
excuse
he
approaches
you
shall
hear
him

great
command

bloody
passage
led
your
wars
even
to
the
gates
of
rome

more
than
counterpoise

the
charges
of
the
action
we
have
made
peace
with
no
less
honour
to
the
antiates

to
the
romans
and
we
here
deliver
subscribd
by
the
consuls

patricians
together
with
the
seal
o
the

take
hold
of
him
touching
this
dreaded
sight

i
have
entreated

to
watch
the
minutes
of
this
night
that
if
again
this
apparition
come
he
may
approve
our

sit
down
awhile
and
let

so
fortified
against
our
story
what
we
two
nights
have
seen
well
sit
we
down
and
let
us
hear
bernardo
speak
of
this
last
night
of
all
when
yond
same
star
thats
westward
from
the
pole
had
made
his
course
to
illume
that
part
of
heaven
where
now
it
burns
marcellus
and
myself
the
bell
then
beating
one
peace
break
thee
off
look
where
it
comes
again
in
the
same
figure
like
the
king
thats
dead
thou
art
a
scholar
speak
to
it
horatio
looks
it
not
like
the
king
mark
it
horatio
most
like
it
harrows
me
with
fear
and
wonder
it
would
be
spoke
to
question
it
horatio
what
art
thou
that
usurpst
this
time
of
night
together
with
that
fair
and
warlike
form
in
which
the
majesty
of
buried
denmark
did
sometimes
march
by
heaven
i
charge
thee
speak
it
is
offended
see
it
stalks
away
stay
speak
speak
i
charge
thee
speak
tis
gone
and
will
not
answer
how
now
horatio
you
tremble
and
look
pale
is
not
this
something
more
than
fantasy
what
think
you
on
t
before
my
god
i
might
not
this
believe
without
the
sensible
and
true
avouch
of
mine
own
eyes
is
it
not
like
the
king
as
thouart
to
thyself
such
was
the
very
armour
he
had
on
when
he
the
ambitious
norway
combated
so
frownd
he
once
when
in
an
angry
parle
he
smote
the
sledded
polacks
on
the
ice
tis
strange
thus
twice
before
and
jump
at
this
dead
hour
with
martial
stalk
hath
he
gone
by
our
watch
in
what
particular
thought
to
work
i
know
not
but
in
the
gross
and
scope
of
my
opinion
this
bodes
some
strange
eruption
to
our
state
good
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
he
that
knows
why
this
same
strict
and
most
observant
watch
so
nightly
toils
the
subject
of
the
land
and
why
such
daily
cast
of
brazen
cannon
and
foreign
mart
for
implements
of
war
why
such
impress
of
shipwrights
whose
sore
task
does
not
divide
the
sunday
from
the
week
what
might
be
toward
that
this
sweaty
haste
doth
make
the
night
jointlabourer
with
the
day
who
is
t
that
can
inform
me
that
can
i
at
least
the
whisper
goes
so
our
last
king
whose
image
even
but
now
appeard
to
us
was
as
you
know
by
fortinbras
of
norway
thereto
prickd
on
by
a
most
emulate
pride
dard
to
the
combat
in
which
our
valiant
hamlet
for
so
this
side
of
our
known
world
esteemd
him
did
slay
this
fortinbras
who
by
a
seald
compact
well
ratified
by
law
and
heraldry
did
forfeit
with
his
life
all
those
his
lands
which
he
stood
seizd
of
to
the
conqueror
against
the
which
a
moiety
competent
was
gaged
by
our
king
which
had
returnd
to
the
inheritance
of
fortinbras
had
he
been
vanquisher
as
by
the
same
covenant
and
carriage
of
the
article
designd
his
fell
to
hamlet
now
sir
young
fortinbras
of
unimproved
mettle
hot
and
full
hath
in
the
skirts
of
norway
here
and
there
sharkd
up
a
list
of
lawless
resolutes
for
food
and
diet
to
some
enterprise
that
hath
a
stomach
in
t
which
is
no
other
as
it
doth
well
appear
unto
our
state
but
to
recover
of
us
by
strong
hand
and
terms
compulsative
those
foresaid
lands
so
by
his
father
lost
and
this
i
take
it
is
the
main
motive
of
our
preparations
the
source
of
this
our
watch
and
the
chief
head
of
this
posthaste
and
romage
in
the
land
i
think
it
be
no
other
but
een
so
well
may
it
sort
that
this
portentous
figure
comes
armed
through
our
watch
so
like
the
king
that
was
and
is
the
question
of
these
wars
a
mote
it
is
to
trouble
the
minds
eye
in
the
most
high
and
palmy
state
of
rome
a
little
ere
the
mightiest
julius
fell
the
graves
stood
tenantless
and
the
sheeted
dead
did
squeak
and
gibber
in
the
roman
streets
as
stars
with
trains
of
fire
and
dews
of
blood
disasters
in
the
sun
and
the
moist
star
upon
whose
influence
neptunes
empire
stands
was
sick
almost
to
doomsday
with
eclipse
and
even
the
like
precurse
of
fierce
events
as
harbingers
preceding
still
the
fates
and
prologue
to
the
omen
coming
on
have
heaven
and
earth
together
demonstrated
unto
our
climatures
and
countrymen
but
soft
behold
lo
where
it
comes
again
ill
cross
it
though
it
blast
me
stay
illusion
if
thou
hast
any
sound
or
use
of
voice
speak
to
me
if
there
be
any
good
thing
to
be
done
that
may
to
thee
do
ease
and
grace
to
me
speak
to
me
if
thou
art
privy
to
thy
countrys
fate
which
happily
foreknowing
may
avoid
o
speak
or
if
thou
hast
uphoarded
in
thy
life
extorted
treasure
in
the
womb
of
earth
for
which
they
say
you
spirits
oft
walk
in
death
speak
of
it
stay
and
speak
stop
it
marcellus
shall
i
strike
at
it
with
my
partisan
do
if
it
will
not
stand
tis
here
tis
here
tis
gone
we
do
it
wrong
being
so
majestical
to
offer
it
the
show
of
violence
for
it
is
as
the
air
invulnerable
and
our
vain
blows
malicious
mockery
it
was
about
to
speak
when
the
cock
crew
and
then
it
started
like
a
guilty
thing
upon
a
fearful
summons
i
have
heard
the
cock
that
is
the
trumpet
to
the
morn
doth
with
his
lofty
and
shrillsounding
throat
awake
the
god
of
day
and
at
his
warning
whether
in
sea
or
fire
in
earth
or
air
the
extravagant
and
erring
spirit
hies
to
his
confine
and
of
the
truth
herein
this
present
object
made
probation
it
faded
on
the
crowing
of
the
cock
some
say
that
ever
gainst
that
season
comes
wherein
our
saviours
birth
is
celebrated
the
bird
of
dawning
singeth
all
night
long
and
then
they
say
no
spirit
can
walk
abroad
the
nights
are
wholesome
then
no
planets
strike
no
fairy
takes
nor
witch
hath
power
to
charm
so
hallowd
and
so
gracious
is
the
time
so
have
i
heard
and
do
in
part
believe
it
but
look
the
morn
in
russet
mantle
clad
walks
oer
the
dew
of
yon
high
eastern
hill
break
we
our
watch
up
and
by
my
advice
let
us
impart
what
we
have
seen
tonight
unto
young
hamlet
for
upon
my
life
this
spirit
dumb
to
us
will
speak
to
him
do
you
consent
we
shall
acquaint
him
with
it
as
needful
in
our
loves
fitting
our
duty
lets
dot
i
pray
and
i
this
morning
know
where
we
shall
find
him
most
conveniently
though
yet
of
hamlet
our
dear
brothers
death
the
memory
be
green
and
that
it
us
befitted
to
bear
our
hearts
in
grief
and
our
whole
kingdom
to
be
contracted
in
one
brow
of
woe
yet
so
far
hath
discretion
fought
with
nature
that
we
with
wisest
sorrow
think
on
him
together
with
remembrance
of
ourselves
therefore
our
sometime
sister
now
our
queen
the
imperial
jointress
of
this
warlike
state
have
we
as
twere
with
a
defeated
joy
with
one
auspicious
and
one
dropping
eye
with
mirth
in
funeral
and
with
dirge
in
marriage
in
equal
scale
weighing
delight
and
dole
taken
to
wife
nor
have
we
herein
barrd
your
better
wisdoms
which
have
freely
gone
with
this
affair
along
for
all
our
thanks
now
follows
that
you
know
young
fortinbras
holding
a
weak
supposal
of
our
worth
or
thinking
by
our
late
dear
brothers
death
our
state
to
be
disjoint
and
out
of
frame
colleagued
with
the
dream
of
his
advantage
he
hath
not
faild
to
pester
us
with
message
importing
the
surrender
of
those
lands
lost
by
his
father
with
all
bands
of
law
to
our
most
valiant
brother
so
much
for
him
now
for
ourself
and
for
this
time
of
meeting
thus
much
the
business
is
we
have
here
writ
to
norway
uncle
of
young
fortinbras
who
impotent
and
bedrid
scarcely
hears
of
this
his
nephews
purpose
to
suppress
his
further
gait
herein
in
that
the
levies
the
lists
and
full
proportions
are
all
made
out
of
his
subject
and
we
here
dispatch
you
good
cornelius
and
you
voltimand
for
bearers
of
this
greeting
to
old
norway
giving
to
you
no
further
personal
power
to
business
with
the
king
more
than
the
scope
of
these
delated
articles
allow
farewell
and
let
your
haste
commend
your
duty
in
that
and
all
things
will
we
show
our
duty
in
that
and
all
things
will
we
show
our
duty

doubt
it
nothing
heartily
farewell
and
now
laertes
whats
the
news
with
you

told
us
of
some
suit
what
ist

cannot
speak
of
reason
to
the
dane
and
lose
your
voice
what
wouldst
thou
beg
laertes
that
shall
not
be
my
offer
not
thy
asking
the
head
is
not
more
native
to
the
heart
the
hand
more
instrumental
to
the
mouth
than
is
the
throne
of
denmark
to
thy
father
what
wouldst
thou
have
laertes
dread
my
lord
your
leave
and
favour
to
return
to
france
from
whence
though
willingly
i
came
to
denmark
to
show
my
duty
in
your
coronation
yet
now
i
must
confess
that
duty
done
my
thoughts
and
wishes
bend
again
toward
france
and
bow
them
to
your
gracious
leave
and
pardon
have
you
your
fathers
leave
what
says
polonius
he
hath
my
lord
wrung
from
me
my
slow
leave
by
laboursome
petition
and
at
last
upon
his
will

hard
consent

him
leave
to
go

fair
hour

best
graces

thy
will

little

and
less
than
kind
how
is
it
that
the
clouds
still
hang
on
you
not
so
my
lord
i
am
too
much
i
the
sun
good
hamlet
cast
thy
nighted
colour
off
and
let
thine
eye
look
like
a
friend
on
denmark
do
not
for
ever
with
thy
vailed
lids
seek
for
thy
noble
father
in
the
dust
thou
knowst
tis
common
all
that
live
must
die
passing
through
nature
to
eternity
ay
madam
it
is
common
if
it
be
why
seems
it
so
particular
with
thee
seems
madam
nay
it
is
i
know
not
seems
tis
not
alone
my
inky
cloak
good
mother
nor
customary
suits
of
solemn
black
nor
windy
suspiration
of
forcd
breath
no
nor
the
fruitful
river
in
the
eye
nor
the
dejected
haviour
of
the
visage
together
with
all
forms
modes
shows
of
grief
that
can
denote
me
truly
these
indeed
seem
for
they
are
actions
that
a
man
might
play
but
i
have
that
within
which
passeth
show
these
but
the
trappings
and
the
suits
of
woe
tis
sweet
and
commendable
in
your
nature
hamlet
to
give
these
mourning
duties
to
your
father
but
you
must
know
your
father
lost
a
father
that
father
lost
lost
his
and
the
survivor
bound
in
filial
obligation
for
some
term
to
do
obsequious
sorrow
but
to
persever
in
obstinate
condolement
is
a
course
of
impious
stubbornness
tis
unmanly
grief
it
shows
a
will
most
incorrect
to
heaven
a
heart
unfortified
a
mind
impatient
an
understanding
simple
and
unschoold
for
what
we
know
must
be
and
is
as
common
as
any
the
most
vulgar
thing
to
sense
why
should
we
in
our
peevish
opposition
take
it
to
heart
fie
tis
a
fault
to
heaven
a
fault
against
the
dead
a
fault
to
nature
to
reason
most
absurd
whose
common
theme
is
death
of
fathers
and
who
still
hath
cried
from
the
first
corse
till
he
that
died
today
this
must
be
so
we
pray
you
throw
to
earth
this
unprevailing
woe
and
think
of
us
as
of
a
father
for
let
the
world
take
note
you
are
the
most
immediate
to
our
throne
and
with
no
less
nobility
of
love
than
that
which
dearest
father
bears
his
son
do
i
impart
toward
you
for
your
intent
in
going
back
to
school
in
wittenberg
it
is
most
retrograde
to
our
desire
and
we
beseech
you
bend
you
to
remain
here
in
the
cheer
and
comfort
of
our
eye
our
chiefest
courtier
cousin
and
our
son
let
not
thy
mother
lose
her
prayers
hamlet
i
pray
thee
stay
with
us
go
not
to
wittenberg
i
shall
in
all
my
best
obey
you
madam
why
tis
a
loving
and
a
fair
reply
be
as
ourself
in
denmark
madam
come
this
gentle
and
unforcd
accord
of
hamlet
sits
smiling
to
my
heart
in
grace
whereof
no
jocund
health
that
denmark
drinks
today
but
the
great
cannon
to
the
clouds
shall
tell
and
the
kings
rouse
the
heavens
shall
bruit
again
respeaking
earthly
thunder
come
away
o
that
this
too
too
solid
flesh
would
melt
thaw
and
resolve
itself
into
a
dew
or
that
the
everlasting
had
not
fixd
his
canon
gainst
selfslaughter
o
god
o
god
how
weary
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
seem
to
me
all
the
uses
of
this
world
fie
on
t
o
fie
tis
an
unweeded
garden
that
grows
to
seed
things
rank
and
gross
in
nature
possess
it
merely
that
it
should
come
to
this
but
two
months
dead
nay
not
so
much
not
two
so
excellent
a
king
that
was
to
this
hyperion
to
a
satyr
so
loving
to
my
mother
that
he
might
not
beteem
the
winds
of
heaven
visit
her
face
too
roughly
heaven
and
earth
must
i
remember
why
she
would
hang
on
him
as
if
increase
of
appetite
had
grown
by
what
it
fed
on
and
yet
within
a
month
let
me
not
think
ont
frailty
thy
name
is
woman
a
little
month
or
ere
those
shoes
were
old
with
which
she
followd
my
poor

body
like
niobe
all
tears
why
she
even
she
o
god
a
beast
that
wants
discourse
of
reason
would
have
mournd
longer
married
with
mine
uncle
my
fathers
brother
but
no
more
like
my
father
than
i
to
hercules
within
a
month
ere
yet
the
salt
of
most
unrighteous
tears
had
left
the
flushing
in
her
galled
eyes
she
married
o
most
wicked
speed
to
post
with
such
dexterity
to
incestuous
sheets
it
is
not
nor
it
cannot
come
to
good
but
break
my
heart
for
i
must
hold
my
tongue
hail
to
your
lordship
i
am
glad
to
see
you
well
horatio
or
i
do
forget
myself
the
same

your
poor
servant

that
name
with
you

truant
disposition

my
lord

would
not
hear
your
enemy

mine
ear
that
violence
to
make
it
truster
of
your
own
report
against
yourself
i
know
you
are
no
truant
but
what
is
your
affair

elsinore
well
teach
you
to
drink
deep
ere

depart
my
lord
i
came
to
see
your
fathers
funeral
i
pray
thee

not
mock
me
fellowstudent
i
think

to
see

followd
hard
upon
thrift
thrift
horatio

funeral
bakd

had
met
my
dearest
foe
in
heaven
ere

had
ever
seen
that
day
horatio

father
methinks
i
see
my
father
o
where
my
lord
in
my
minds
eye
horatio
i
saw
him
once
he
was
a
goodly
king
he
was
a
man
take
him
for
all
in
all
i
shall
not
look
upon
his
like
again
my
lord
i
think
i
saw
him
yesternight
saw
who
my
lord
the
king
your
father
the
king
my
father
season
your
admiration
for
a
while
with
an
attent
ear
till
i
may
deliver
upon
the
witness
of
these
gentlemen
this
marvel
to
you
for
gods
love
let
me
hear
two
nights
together
had
these
gentlemen
marcellus
and
bernardo
on
their
watch
in
the
dead
vast
and
middle
of
the
night
been
thus
encounterd
a
figure
like
your
father
armed
at
points
exactly
capape
appears
before
them
and
with
solemn
march
goes
slow
and
stately
by
them
thrice
he
walkd
by
their
oppressd
and
fearsurprised
eyes
within
his
truncheons
length
whilst
they
distilld
almost
to
jelly
with
the
act
of
fear
stand
dumb
and
speak
not
to
him
this
to
me
in
dreadful
secrecy
impart
they
did
and
i
with
them
the
third
night
kept
the
watch
where
as
they
had
deliverd
both
in
time
form
of
the
thing
each
word
made
true
and
good
the
apparition
comes
i
knew
your
father
these
hands
are
not
more
like
but
where
was
this
my
lord
upon
the
platform
where
we
watchd
did
you
not
speak
to
it
my
lord
i
did
but
answer
made
it
none
yet
once
methought
it
lifted
up
its
head
and
did
address
itself
to
motion
like
as
it
would
speak
but
even
then
the
morning
cock
crew
loud
and
at
the
sound
it
shrunk
in
haste
away
and
vanishd
from
our
sight
tis
very
strange
as
i
do
live
my
honourd
lord
tis
true
and
we
did
think
it
writ
down
in
our
duty
to
let
you
know
of
it
indeed
indeed
sirs
but
this
troubles
me
hold
you
the
watch
tonight
we
do
my
lord
we
do
my
lord
armd
say
you
armd
my
lord
armd
my
lord
from
top
to
toe
my
lord
from
head
to
foot
my
lord
from
head
to
foot
then
saw
you
not
his
face
o
yes
my
lord
he
wore
his
beaver
up
what
lookd
he
frowningly
a
countenance
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
pale
or
red
nay
very
pale
and
fixd
his
eyes
upon
you
most
constantly
i
would
i
had
been
there
it
would
have
much
amazd
you
very
like
very
like
stayd
it
long
while
one
with
moderate
haste
might
tell
a
hundred
longer
longer
longer
longer
not
when
i
saw
it
his
beard
was
grizzled
no
it
was
as
i
have
seen
it
in
his
life
a
sable
silverd
i
will
watch
tonight
perchance
twill
walk
again
i
warrant
it
will
if
it
assume
my
noble
fathers
person
ill
speak
to
it
though
hell
itself
should
gape
and
bid
me
hold
my
peace
i
pray
you
all
if
you
have
hitherto
conceald
this
sight
let
it
be
tenable
in
your
silence
still
and
whatsoever
else
shall
hap
tonight
give
it
an
understanding
but
no
tongue
i
will
requite
your
loves
so
fare
you
well
upon
the
platform
twixt
eleven
and
twelve
ill
visit
you
our
duty
to
your
honour
your
loves
as
mine
to
you
farewell
my
fathers
spirit
in
arms
all
is
not
well
i
doubt
some
foul
play
would
the
night
were
come
till
then
sit
still
my
soul
foul
deeds
will
rise
though
all
the
earth
oerwhelm
them
to
mens
eyes
my
necessaries
are
embarkd
farewell
and
sister
as
the
winds
give
benefit
and
convoy
is
assistant
do
not
sleep
but
let
me
hear
from
you
do
you
doubt
that
for
hamlet
and
the
trifling
of
his
favour
hold
it
a
fashion
and
a
toy
in
blood
a
violet
in
the
youth
of
primy
nature
forward
not
permanent
sweet
not
lasting
the
perfume
and
suppliance
of
a
minute
no
more
no
more
but
so
think
it
no
more
for
nature
crescent
does
not
grow
alone
in
thews
and
bulk
but
as
this
temple
waxes
the
inward
service
of
the
mind
and
soul
grows
wide
withal
perhaps
he
loves
you
now
and
now
no
soil
nor
cautel
doth
besmirch
the
virtue
of
his
will
but
you
must
fear
his
greatness
weighd
his
will
is
not
his
own
for
he
himself
is
subject
to
his
birth
he
may
not
as
unvalud
persons
do
carve
for
himself
for
on
his
choice
depends
the
safety
and
the
health
of
the
whole
state
and
therefore
must
his
choice
be
circumscribd
unto
the
voice
and
yielding
of
that
body
whereof
he
is
the
head
then
if
he
says
he
loves
you
it
fits
your
wisdom
so
far
to
believe
it
as
he
in
his
particular
act
and
place
may
give
his
saying
deed
which
is
no
further
than
the
main
voice
of
denmark
goes
withal
then
weigh
what
loss
your
honour
may
sustain
if
with
too
credent
ear
you
list
his
songs
or
lose
your
heart
or
your
chaste
treasure
open
to
his
unmasterd
importunity
fear
it
ophelia
fear
it
my
dear
sister
and
keep
you
in
the
rear
of
your
affection
out
of
the
shot
and
danger
of
desire
the
chariest
maid
is
prodigal
enough
if
she
unmask
her
beauty
to
the
moon
virtue
herself
scapes
not
calumnious
strokes
the
canker
galls
the
infants
of
the
spring
too
oft
before
their
buttons
be
disclosd
and
in
the
morn
and
liquid
dew
of
youth
contagious
blastments
are
most
imminent
be
wary
then
best
safety
lies
in
fear
youth
to
itself
rebels
though
none
else
near
i
shall
th
effect
of
this
good
lesson
keep
as
watchman
to
my
heart
but
good
my
brother
do
not
as
some
ungracious
pastors
do
show
me
the
steep
and
thorny
way
to
heaven
whiles
like
a
puffd
and
reckless
libertine
himself
the
primrose
path
of
dalliance
treads
and
recks
not
his
own
rede
o
fear
me
not
i
stay
too
long
but
here
my
father
comes
a
double
blessing
is
a
double
grace
occasion
smiles
upon
a
second
leave
yet
here
laertes
aboard
aboard
for
shame
the
wind
sits
in
the
shoulder
of
your
sail
and
you
are
stayd
for
there
my
blessing
with
thee
and
these
few
precepts
in
thy
memory
look
thou
character
give
thy
thoughts
no
tongue
nor
any
unproportiond
thought
his
act
be
thou
familiar
but
by
no
means
vulgar
the
friends
thou
hast
and
their
adoption
tried
grapple
them
to
thy
soul
with
hoops
of
steel
but
do
not
dull
thy
palm
with
entertainment
of
each
newhatchd
unfledgd
comrade
beware
of
entrance
to
a
quarrel
but
being
in
bear
t
that
th
opposed
may
beware
of
thee
give
every
man
thine
ear
but
few
thy
voice
take
each
mans
censure
but
reserve
thy
judgment
costly
thy
habit
as
thy
purse
can
buy
but
not
expressd
in
fancy
rich
not
gaudy
for
the
apparel
oft
proclaims
the
man
and
they
in
france
of
the
best
rank
and
station
are
most
select
and
generous
chief
in
that
neither
a
borrower
nor
a
lender
be
for
loan
oft
loses
both
itself
and
friend
and
borrowing
dulls
the
edge
of
husbandry
this
above
all
to
thine
own
self
be
true
and
it
must
follow
as
the
night
the
day
thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
man
farewell
my
blessing
season
this
in
thee
most
humbly
do
i
take
my
leave
my
lord
the
time
invites
you
go
your
servants
tend
farewell
ophelia
and
remember
well
what
i
have
said
to
you
tis
in
my
memory
lockd
and
you
yourself
shall
keep
the
key
of
it
farewell
what
is
t
ophelia
he
hath
said
to
you
so
please
you
something
touching
the
lord
hamlet
marry
well
bethought
tis
told
me
he
hath
very
oft
of
late
given
private
time
to
you
and
you
yourself
have
of
your
audience
been
most
free
and
bounteous
if
it
be
so
as
so
tis
put
on
me
and
that
in
way
of
caution
i
must
tell
you
you
do
not
understand
yourself
so
clearly
as
it
behoves
my
daughter
and
your
honour
what
is
between
you
give
me
up
the
truth
he
hath
my
lord
of
late
made
many
tenders
of
his
affection
to
me
affection
pooh
you
speak
like
a
green
girl
unsifted
in
such
perilous
circumstance
do
you
believe
his
tenders
as
you
call
them
i
do
not
know
my
lord
what
i
should
think
marry
ill
teach
you
think
yourself
a
baby
that
you
have
taen
these
tenders
for
true
pay
which
are
not
sterling
tender
yourself
more
dearly
or
not
to
crack
the
wind
of
the
poor
phrase
running
it
thus
youll
tender
me
a
fool
my
lord
he
hath
importund
me
with
love
in
honourable
fashion
ay
fashion
you
may
call
it
go
to
go
to
and
hath
given
countenance
to
his
speech
my
lord
with
almost
all
the
holy
vows
of
heaven
ay
springes
to
catch
woodcocks
i
do
know
when
the
blood
burns
how
prodigal
the
soul
lends
the
tongue
vows
these
blazes
daughter
giving
more
light
than
heat
extinct
in
both
even
in
their
promise
as
it
is
amaking
you
must
not
take
for
fire
from
this
time
be
somewhat
scanter
of
your
maiden
presence
set
your
entreatments
at
a
higher
rate
than
a
command
to
parley
for
lord
hamlet
believe
so
much
in
him
that
he
is
young
and
with
a
larger
tether
may
he
walk
than
may
be
given
you
in
few
ophelia
do
not
believe
his
vows
for
they
are
brokers
not
of
that
dye
which
their
investments
show
but
mere
implorators
of
unholy
suits
breathing
like
sanctified
and
pious
bawds
the
better
to
beguile
this
is
for
all
i
would
not
in
plain
terms
from
this
time
forth
have
you
so
slander
any
moments
leisure
as
to
give
words
or
talk
with
the
lord
hamlet
look
to
t
i
charge
you
come
your
ways
i
shall
obey
my
lord
the
air
bites
shrewdly
it
is
very
cold
it
is
a
nipping
and
an
eager
air
what
hour
now
i
think
it
lacks
of
twelve
no
it
is
struck
indeed
i
heard
it
not
then
it
draws
near
the
season
wherein
the
spirit
held
his
wont
to
walk
what
does
this
mean
my
lord
the
king
doth
wake
tonight
and
takes
his
rouse
keeps
wassail
and
the
swaggering
upspring
reels
and
as
he
drains
his
draughts
of
rhenish
down
the
kettledrum
and
trumpet
thus
bray
out
the
triumph
of
his
pledge
is
it
a
custom
ay
marry
is
t
but
to
my
mind
though
i
am
native
here
and
to
the
manner
born
it
is
a
custom
more
honourd
in
the
breach
than
the
observance
this
heavyheaded
revel
east
and
west
makes
us
traducd
and
taxd
of
other
nations
they
clepe
us
drunkards
and
with
swinish
phrase
soil
our
addition
and
indeed
it
takes
from
our
achievements
though
performd
at
height
the
pith
and
marrow
of
our
attribute
so
oft
it
chances
in
particular
men
that
for
some
vicious
mole
of
nature
in
them
as
in
their
birth
wherein
they
are
not
guilty
since
nature
cannot
choose
his
origin
by
the
oergrowth
of
some
complexion
oft
breaking
down
the
pales
and
forts
of
reason
or
by
some
habit
that
too
much
oerleavens
the
form
of
plausive
manners
that
these
men
carrying
i
say
the
stamp
of
one
defect
being
natures
livery
or
fortunes
star
their
virtues
else
be
they
as
pure
as
grace
as
infinite
as
man
may
undergo
shall
in
the
general
censure
take
corruption
from
that
particular
fault
the
dram
of

doth
all
the
noble
substance
of
a

to
his

let
me
not

in

but
tell
why
thy
canonizd
bones
hearsed
in
death
have
burst
their
cerements
why
the
sepulchre
wherein
we
saw
thee
quietly
inurnd
hath
opd
his
ponderous
and
marble
jaws
to
cast
thee
up
again
what
may
this
mean
that
thou
dead
corse
again
in
complete
steel
revisitst
thus
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
making
night
hideous
and
we
fools
of
nature
so
horridly
to
shake
our
disposition
with
thoughts
beyond
the
reaches
of
our
souls
say
why
is
this
wherefore
what
should
we
do
it
beckons
you
to
go
away
with
it
as
if
it
some
impartment
did
desire
to
you
alone
look
with
what
courteous
action
it
waves
you
to
a
more
removed
ground
but
do
not
go
with
it
no
by
no
means
it
will
not
speak
then
will
i
follow
it
do
not
my
lord
why
what
should
be
the
fear
i
do
not
set
my
life
at
a
pins
fee
and
for
my
soul
what
can
it
do
to
that
being
a
thing
immortal
as
itself
it
waves
me
forth
again
ill
follow
it
what
if
it
tempt
you
toward
the
flood
my
lord
or
to
the
dreadful
summit
of
the
cliff
that
beetles
oer
his
base
into
the
sea
and
there
assume
some
other
horrible
form
which
might
deprive
your
sovereignty
of
reason
and
draw
you
into
madness
think
of
it
the
very
place
puts
toys
of
desperation
without
more
motive
into
every
brain
that
looks
so
many
fathoms
to
the
sea
and
hears
it
roar
beneath
it
waves
me
still
go
on
ill
follow
thee
you
shall
not
go
my
lord
hold
off
your
hands
be
ruld
you
shall
not
go
my
fate
cries
out
and
makes
each
petty
artery
in
this
body
as
hardy
as
the
nemean
lions
nerve
still
am
i
calld
unhand
me
gentlemen
by
heaven
ill
make
a
ghost
of
him
that
lets
me
i
say
away
go
on
ill
follow
thee
he
wares
desperate
with
imagination
lets
follow
tis
not
fit
thus
to
obey
him
have
after
to
what
issue
will
this
come
something
is
rotten
in
the
state
of
denmark
heaven
will
direct
it
nay
lets
follow
him
whither
wilt
thou
lead
me
speak
ill
go
no
further
mark
me
i
will
my
hour
is
almost
come
when
i
to
sulphurous
and
tormenting
flames
must
render
up
myself
alas
poor
ghost
pity
me
not
but
lend
thy
serious
hearing
to
what
i
shall
unfold
speak
i
am
bound
to
hear
so
art
thou
to
revenge
when
thou
shalt
hear
what
i
am
thy
fathers
spirit
doomd
for
a
certain
term
to
walk
the
night
and
for
the
day
confind
to
fast
in
fires
till
the
foul
crimes
done
in
my
days
of
nature
are
burnt
and
purgd
away
but
that
i
am
forbid
to
tell
the
secrets
of
my
prisonhouse
i
could
a
tale
unfold
whose
lightest
word
would
harrow
up
thy
soul
freeze
thy
young
blood
make
thy
two
eyes
like
stars
start
from
their
spheres
thy
knotted
and
combined
locks
to
part
and
each
particular
hair
to
stand
an
end
like
quills
upon
the
fretful
porpentine
but
this
eternal
blazon
must
not
be
to
ears
of
flesh
and
blood
list
list
o
list
if
thou
didst
ever
thy
dear
father
love
o
god
revenge
his
foul
and
most
unnatural
murder
murder
murder
most
foul
as
in
the
best
it
is
but
this
most
foul
strange
and
unnatural
haste
me
to
knowt
that
i
with
wings
as
swift
as
meditation
or
the
thoughts
of
love
may
sweep
to
my
revenge
i
find
thee
apt
and
duller
shouldst
thou
be
than
the
fat
weed
that
rots
itself
in
ease
on
lethe
wharf
wouldst
thou
not
stir
in
this
now
hamlet
hear
tis
given
out
that
sleeping
in
mine
orchard
a
serpent
stung
me
so
the
whole
ear
of
denmark
is
by
a
forged
process
of
my
death
rankly
abusd
but
know
thou
noble
youth
the
serpent
that
did
sting
thy
fathers
life
now
wears
his
crown
o
my
prophetic
soul
my
uncle
ay
that
incestuous
that
adulterate
beast
with
witchcraft
of
his
wit
with
traitorous
gifts
o
wicked
wit
and
gifts
that
have
the
power
so
to
seduce
won
to
his
shameful
lust
the
will
of
my
most
seemingvirtuous
queen
o
hamlet
what
a
fallingoff
was
there
from
me
whose
love
was
of
that
dignity
that
it
went
hand
in
hand
even
with
the
vow
i
made
to
her
in
marriage
and
to
decline
upon
a
wretch
whose
natural
gifts
were
poor
to
those
of
mine
but
virtue
as
it
never
will
be
movd
though
lewdness
court
it
in
a
shape
of
heaven
so
lust
though
to
a
radiant
angel
linkd
will
sate
itself
in
a
celestial
bed
and
prey
on
garbage
but
soft
methinks
i
scent
the
morning
air
brief
let
me
be
sleeping
within
mine
orchard
my
custom
always
in
the
afternoon
upon
my
secure
hour
thy
uncle
stole
with
juice
of
cursed
hebona
in
a
vial
and
in
the
porches
of
mine
ears
did
pour
the
leperous
distilment
whose
effect
holds
such
an
enmity
with
blood
of
man
that
swift
as
quicksilver
it
courses
through
the
natural
gates
and
alleys
of
the
body
and
with
a
sudden
vigour
it
doth
posset
and
curd
like
eager
droppings
into
milk
the
thin
and
wholesome
blood
so
did
it
mine
and
a
most
instant
tetter
barkd
about
most
lazarlike
with
vile
and
loathsome
crust
all
my
smooth
body
thus
was
i
sleeping
by
a
brothers
hand
of
life
of
crown
of
queen
at
once
dispatchd
cut
off
even
in
the
blossoms
of
my
sin
unhouseld
disappointed
unaneld
no
reckoning
made
but
sent
to
my
account
with
all
my
imperfections
on
my
head
o
horrible
o
horrible
most
horrible
if
thou
hast
nature
in
thee

it
not
let
not
the
royal
bed
of
denmark

couch
for
luxury

reynaldo
i
will
my
lord
you
shall
do
marvellous
wisely
good
reynaldo
before
you
visit
him
to
make
inquiry
of
his
behaviour
my
lord
i
did
intend
it
marry
well
said
very
well
said
look
you
sir
inquire
me
first
what
danskers
are
in
paris
and
how
and
who
what
means
and
where
they
keep
what
company
at
what
expense
and
finding
by
this
encompassment
and
drift
of
question
that
they
do
know
my
son
come
you
more
nearer
than
your
particular
demands
will
touch
it
take
you
as
twere
some
distant
knowledge
of
him
as
thus
i
know
his
father
and
his
friends
and
in
part
him
do
you
mark
this
reynaldo
ay
very
well
my
lord
and
in
part
him
but
you
may
say
not
well
but
ift
be
he
i
mean
hes
very
wild
addicted
so
and
so
and
there
put
on
him
what
forgeries
you
please
marry
none
so
rank
as
may
dishonour
him
take
heed
of
that
but
sir
such
wanton
wild
and
usual
slips
as
are
companions
noted
and
most
known
to
youth
and
liberty
as
gaming
my
lord
ay
or
drinking
fencing
swearing
quarrelling
drabbing
you
may
go
so
far
my
lord
that
would
dishonour
him
faith
no
as
you
may
season
it
in
the
charge
you
must
not
put
another
scandal
on
him
that
he
is
open
to
incontinency
thats
not
my
meaning
but
breathe
his
faults
so
quaintly
that
they
may
seem
the
taints
of
liberty
the
flash
and
outbreak
of
a
fiery
mind
a
savageness
in
unreclaimed
blood
of
general
assault
but
my
good
lord
wherefore
should
you
do
this
ay
my
lord
i
would
know
that
marry
sir
heres
my
drift
and
i
believe
it
is
a
fetch
of
warrant
you
laying
these
slight
sullies
on
my
son
as
twere
a
thing
a
little
soild
i
the
working
mark
you
your
party
in
converse
him
you
would
sound
having
ever
seen
in
the
prenominate
crimes
the
youth
you
breathe
of
guilty
be
assurd
he
closes
with
you
in
this
consequence
good
sir
or
so
or
friend
or
gentleman
according
to
the
phrase
or
the
addition
of
man
and
country
very
good
my
lord
and
then
sir
does
he
this
he
does
what
was
i
about
to
say
by
the
mass
i
was
about
to
say
something
where
did
i
leave
at
closes
in
the
consequence
at
friend
or
so
and
gentleman
at
closes
in
the
consequence
ay
marry
he
closes
with
you
thus
i
know
the
gentleman
i
saw
him
yesterday
or
t
other
day
or
then
or
then
with
such
or
such
and
as
you
say
there
was
a
gaming
there
oertook
in
s
rouse
there
falling
out
at
tennis
or
perchance
i
saw
him
enter
such
a
house
of
sale
videlicet
a
brothel
or
so
forth
see
you
now
your
bait
of
falsehood
takes
this
carp
of
truth
and
thus
do
we
of
wisdom
and
of
reach
with
windlasses
and
with
assays
of
bias
by
indirections
find
directions
out
so
by
my
former
lecture
and
advice
shall
you
my
son
you
have
me
have
you
not
my
lord
i
have
god

the
matter
alas
my
lord
i
have
been
so
affrighted
with
what
in
the
name
of
god
my
lord
as
i
was
sewing
in
my
closet
lord
hamlet
with
his
doublet
all
unbracd
no
hat
upon
his
head
his
stockings
fould
ungarterd
and
downgyved
to
his
ancle
pale
as
his
shirt
his
knees
knocking
each
other
and
with
a
look
so
piteous
in
purport
as
if
he
had
been
loosed
out
of
hell
to
speak
of
horrors
he
comes
before
me
mad
for
thy
love
my
lord
i
do
not
know
but
truly
i
do
fear
it
what
said
he
he
took
me
by
the
wrist
and
held
me
hard
then
goes
he
to
the
length
of
all
his
arm
and
with
his
other
hand
thus
oer
his
brow
he
falls
to
such
perusal
of
my
face
as
he
would
draw
it
long
stayd
he
so
at
last
a
little
shaking
of
mine
arm
and
thrice
his
head
thus
waving
up
and
down
he
raisd
a
sigh
so
piteous
and
profound
that
it
did
seem
to
shatter
all
his
bulk
and
end
his
being
that
done
he
lets
me
go
and
with
his
head
over
his
shoulder
turnd
he
seemd
to
find
his
way
without
his
eyes
for
out
o
doors
he
went
without
their
help
and
to
the
last
bended
their
light
on
me
come
go
with
me
i
will
go
seek
the
king
this
is
the
very
ecstasy
of
love
whose
violent
property
fordoes
itself
and
leads
the
will
to
desperate
undertakings
as
oft
as
any
passion
under
heaven
that
does
afflict
our
natures
i
am
sorry
what
have
you
given
him
any
hard
words
of
late
no
my
good
lord
but
as
you
did
command
i
did
repel
his
letters
and
denied
his
access
to
me
that
hath
made
him
mad
i
am
sorry
that
with
better
heed
and
judgment
i
had
not
quoted
him
i
feard
he
did
but
trifle
and
meant
to
wrack
thee
but
beshrew
my
jealousy
by
heaven
it
is
as
proper
to
our
age
to
cast
beyond
ourselves
in
our
opinions
as
it
is
common
for
the
younger
sort
to
lack
discretion
come
go
we
to
the
king
this
must
be
known
which
being
kept
close
might
move
more
grief
to
hide
than
hate
to
utter
love
come
welcome
dear
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
moreover
that
we
much
did
long
to
see
you
the
need
we
have
to
use
you
did
provoke
our
hasty
sending
something
have
you
heard
of
hamlets
transformation
so
i
call
it
since
nor
the
exterior
nor
the
inward
man
resembles
that
it
was
what
it
should
be
more
than
his
fathers
death
that
thus
hath
put
him
so
much
from
the
understanding
of
himself
i
cannot
dream
of
i
entreat
you
both
that
being
of
so
young
days
brought
up
with
him
and
since
so
neighbourd
to
his
youth
and
humour
that
you
vouchsafe
your
rest
here
in
our
court
some
little
time
so
by
your
companies
to
draw
him
on
to
pleasures
and
to
gather
so
much
as
from
occasion
you
may
glean
wher
aught
to
us
unknown
afflicts
him
thus
that
opend
lies
within
our
remedy
good
gentlemen
he
hath
much
talkd
of
you
and
sure
i
am
two
men
there
are
not
living
to
whom
he
more
adheres
if
it
will
please
you
to
show
us
so
much
gentry
and
good
will
as
to
expend
your
time
with
us
awhile
for
the
supply
and
profit
of
our
hope
your
visitation
shall
receive
such
thanks
as
fits
a
kings
remembrance
both
your
majesties
might
by
the
sovereign
power
you
have
of
us
put
your
dread
pleasures
more
into
command
than
to
entreaty
but
we
both
obey
and
here
give
up
ourselves
in
the
full
bent
to
lay
our
service
freely
at
your
feet
to
be
commanded
thanks
rosencrantz
and
gentle
guildenstern
thanks
guildenstern
and
gentle
rosencrantz
and
i
beseech
you
instantly
to
visit
my
too
much
changed
son
go
some
of
you
and
bring
these
gentlemen
where
hamlet
is
heavens
make
our
presence
and
our
practices
pleasant
and
helpful
to
him
ay
amen
the
ambassadors
from
norway
my
good
lord

still
hast
been
the
father
of
good
news

my
lord

good
liege

my
duty
as
i
hold
my
soul
both
to
my
god
and
to
my
gracious
king
and
i
do
think
or
else
this
brain
of
mine
hunts
not
the
trail
of
policy
so
sure
as
it
hath
usd
to
do
that
i
have
found
the
very
cause
of
hamlets
lunacy
o
speak
of
that
that
do
i
long
to
hear
give
first
admittance
to
the
ambassadors
my
news

be
the
fruit
to
that
great
feast

grace
to
them
and
bring
them
in

tells
me
my
sweet
queen
that
he
hath
found
the
head
and
source
of
all
your
sons
distemper
i
doubt
it
is
noother
but
the
main
his
fathers
death
and
our
oerhasty
marriage
well
we
shall
sift
him
welcome
my
good
friends
say
voltimand
what
from
our
brother
norway
most
fair
return
of
greetings
and
desires
upon
our
first
he
sent
out
to
suppress
his
nephews
levies
which
to
him
appeard
to
be
a
preparation
gainst
the
polack
but
better
lookd
into
he
truly
found
it
was
against
your
highness
whereat
grievd
that
so
his
sickness
age
and
impotence
was
falsely
borne
in
hand
sends
out
arrests
on
fortinbras
which
he
in
brief
obeys
receives
rebuke
from
norway
and
in
fine
makes
vow
before
his
uncle
never
more
to
give
the
assay
of
arms
against
your
majesty
whereon
old
norway
overcome
with
joy
gives
him
three
thousand
crowns
in
annual
fee
and
his
commission
to
employ
those
soldiers
so
levied
as
before
against
the
polack
with
an
entreaty
herein
further
shown
that
it
might
please
you
to
give
quiet
pass
through
your
dominions
for
this
enterprise
on
such
regards
of
safety
and
allowance
as
therein
are
set
down
it
likes
us
well
and
at
our
more
considerd
time
well
read
answer
and
think
upon
this
business
meantime
we
thank
you
for
your
welltook
labour
go
to
your
rest
at
night
well
feast
together
most
welcome
home
this
business
is
well
ended
my
liege
and
madam
to
expostulate
what
majesty
should
be
what
duty
is
why
day
is
day
night
night
and
time
is
time
were
nothing
but
to
waste
night
day
and
time
therefore
since
brevity
is
the
soul
of
wit
and
tediousness
the
limbs
and
outward
flourishes
i
will
be
brief
your
noble
son
is
mad
mad
call
i
it
for
to
define
true
madness
what
is
t
but
to
be
nothing
else
but
mad
but
let
that
go
more
matter
with
less
art
madam
i
swear
i
use
no
art
at
all
that
he
is
mad
tis
true
tis
true
tis
pity
and
pity
tis
tis
true
a
foolish
figure
but
farewell
it
for
i
will
use
no
art
mad
let
us
grant
him
then
and
now
remains
that
we
find
out
the
cause
of
this
effect
or
rather
say
the
cause
of
this
defect
for
this
effect
defective
comes
by
cause
thus
it
remains
and
the
remainder
thus
perpend
i
have
a
daughter
have
while
she
is
mine
who
in
her
duty
and
obedience
mark
hath
given
me
this
now
gather
and
surmise
to
the
celestial
and
my
souls
idol
the
most
beautified
ophelia
thats
an
ill
phrase
a
vile
phrase
beautified
is
a
vile
phrase
but
you
shall
hear
thus
in
her
excellent
white
bosom
these
c
came
this
from
hamlet
to
her
good
madam
stay
awhile
i
will
be
faithful
doubt
thou
the
stars
are
fire
doubt
that
the
sun
doth
move
doubt
truth
to
be
a
liar
but
never
doubt
i
love
o
dear
ophelia
i
am
ill
at
these
numbers
i
have
not
art
to
reckon
my
groans
but
that
i
love
thee
best
o
most
best
believe
it
adieu
thine
evermore
most
dear
lady
whilst
this
machine
is
to
him
hamlet
this
in
obedience
hath
my
daughter
shown
me
and
more
above
hath
his
solicitings
as
they
fell
out
by
time
by
means
and
place
all
given
to
mine
ear
but
how
hath
she
receivd
his
love
what
do
you
think
of
me
as
of
a
man
faithful
and
honourable
i
would
fain
prove
so
but
what
might
you
think
when
i
had
seen
this
hot
love
on
the
wing
as
i
perceivd
it
i
must
tell
you
that
before
my
daughter
told
me
what
might
you
or
my
dear
majesty
your
queen
here
think
if
i
had
playd
the
desk
or
tablebook
or
given
my
heart
a
winking
mute
and
dumb
or
lookd
upon
this
love
with
idle
sight
what
might
you
think
no
i
went
round
to
work
and
my
young
mistress
thus
i
did
bespeak
lord
hamlet
is
a
prince
out
of
thy
star
this
must
not
be
and
then
i
precepts
gave
her
that
she
should
lock
herself
from
his
resort
admit
no
messengers
receive
no
tokens
which
done
she
took
the
fruits
of
my
advice
and
he
repulsed
a
short
tale
to
make
fell
into
a
sadness
then
into
a
fast
thence
to
a
watch
thence
into
a
weakness
thence
to
a
lightness
and
by
this
declension
into
the
madness
wherein
now
he
raves
and
all
we
wail
for
do
you
think
tis
this
it
may
be
very
likely
hath
there
been
such
a
time
id
fain
know
that
that
i
have
positively
said
tis
so
when
it
provd
otherwise
not
that
i
know
take
this
from
this
if
this
be
otherwise
if
circumstances
lead
me
i
will
find
where
truth
is
hid
though
it
were
hid
indeed
within
the
centre
how
may
we
try
it
further
you
know
sometimes
he
walks
four
hours
together
here
in
the
lobby
so
he
does
indeed
at
such
a
time
ill
loose
my
daughter
to
him
be
you
and
i
behind
an
arras
then
mark
the
encounter
if
he
love
her
not
and
be
not
from
his
reason
fallen
thereon
let
me
be
no
assistant
for
a
state
but
keep
a
farm
and
carters
we
will
try
it
but
look
where
sadly
the
poor
wretch
comes
reading
away
i
do
beseech
you
both
away
ill
board
him
presently
o
give
me
leave
how
does
my
good
lord
hamlet
well
god
amercy
do
you
know
me
my
lord
excellent
well
you
are
a
fishmonger
not
i
my
lord
then
i
would
you
were
so
honest
a
man
honest
my
lord
ay
sir
to
be
honest
as
this
world
goes
is
to
be
one
man
picked
out
of
ten
thousand
thats
very
true
my
lord
for
if
the
sun
breed
maggots
in
a
dead
dog
being
a
good
kissing
carrion
have
you
a
daughter
i
have
my
lord
let
her
not
walk
i
the
sun
conception
is
a
blessing
but
not
as
your
daughter
may
conceive
friend
look
to
t
how
say
you
by
that
still
harping
on
my
daughter
yet
he
knew
me
not
at
first
he
said
i
was
a
fishmonger
he
is
far
gone
far
gone
and
truly
in
my
youth
i
suffered
much
extremity
for
love
very
near
this
ill
speak
to
him
again
what
do
you
read
my
lord
words
words
words
what
is
the
matter
my
lord
between
who
i
mean
the
matter
that
you
read
my
lord
slanders
sir
for
the
satirical
rogue
says
here
that
old
men
have
grey
beards
that
their
faces
are
wrinkled
their
eyes
purging
thick
amber
and
plumtree
gum
and
that
they
have
a
plentiful
lack
of
wit
together
with
most
weak
hams
all
which
sir
though
i
most
powerfully
and
potently
believe
yet
i
hold
it
not
honesty
to
have
it
thus
set
down
for
you
yourself
sir
should
be
old
as
i
am
if
like
a
crab
you
could
go
backward
though
this
be
madness
yet
there
is
method
in
t
will
you
walk
out
of
the
air
my
lord
into
my
grave
indeed
that
is
out
o
the
air
how
pregnant
sometimes
his
replies
are
a
happiness
that
often
madness
hits
on
which
reason
and
sanity
could
not
so
prosperously
be
delivered
of
i
will
leave
him
and
suddenly
contrive
the
means
of
meeting
between
him
and
my
daughter
my
honourable
lord
i
will
most
humbly
take
my
leave
of
you
you
cannot
sir
take
from
me
any
thing
that
i
will
more
willingly
part
withal
except
my
life
except
my
life
except
my
life
fare
you
well
my
lord
these
tedious
old
fools
you
go
to
seek
the
lord
hamlet
there
he
is
god
save
you
sir
mine
honoured
lord
my
most
dear
lord
my
excellent
good
friends
how
dost
thou
guildenstern
ah
rosencrantz
good
lads
how
do
ye
both
as
the
indifferent
children
of
the
earth
happy
in
that
we
are
not
over
happy
on
fortunes
cap
we
are
not
the
very
button
nor
the
soles
of
her
shoe
neither
my
lord
then
you
live
about
her
waist
or
in
the
middle
of
her
favours
faith
her
privates
we
in
the
secret
parts
of
fortune
o
most
true
she
is
a
strumpet
what
news
none
my
lord
but
that
the
worlds
grown
honest
then
is
doomsday
near
but
your
news
is
not
true
let
me
question
more
in
particular
what
have
you
my
good
friends
deserved
at
the
hands
of
fortune
that
she
sends
you
to
prison
hither
prison
my
lord
denmarks
a
prison
then
is
the
world
one
a
goodly
one
in
which
there
are
many
confines
wards
and
dungeons
denmark
being
one
o
the
worst
we
think
not
so
my
lord
why
then
tis
none
to
you
for
there
is
nothing
either
good
or
bad
but
thinking
makes
it
so
to
me
it
is
a
prison
why
then
your
ambition
makes
it
one
tis
too
narrow
for
your
mind
o
god
i
could
be
bounded
in
a
nutshell
and
count
myself
a
king
of
infinite
space
were
it
not
that
i
have
bad
dreams
which
dreams
indeed
are
ambition
for
the
very
substance
of
the
ambitious
is
merely
the
shadow
of
a
dream
a
dream
itself
is
but
a
shadow
truly
and
i
hold
ambition
of
so
airy
and
light
a
quality
that
it
is
but
a
shadows
shadow
then
are
our
beggars
bodies
and
our
monarchs
and
outstretched
heroes
the
beggars
shadows
shall
we
to
the
court
for
by
my
fay
i
cannot
reason
well
wait
upon
you
well
wait
upon
you
no
such
matter
i
will
not
sort
you
with
the
rest
of
my
servants
for
to
speak
to
you
like
an
honest
man
i
am
most
dreadfully
attended
but
in
the
beaten
way
of
friendship
what
make
you
at
elsinore
to
visit
you
my
lord
no
other
occasion
beggar
that
i
am
i
am
even
poor
in
thanks
but
i
thank
you
and
sure
dear
friends
my
thanks
are
too
dear
a
halfpenny
were
you
not
sent
for
is
it
your
own
inclining
is
it
a
free
visitation
come
come
deal
justly
with
me
come
come
nay
speak
what
should
we
say
my
lord
why
anything
but
to
the
purpose
you
were
sent
for
and
there
is
a
kind
of
confession
in
your
looks
which
your
modesties
have
not
craft
enough
to
colour
i
know
the
good
king
and
queen
have
sent
for
you
to
what
end
my
lord
that
you
must
teach
me
but
let
me
conjure
you
by
the
rights
of
our
fellowship
by
the
consonancy
of
our
youth
by
the
obligation
of
our
everpreserved
love
and
by
what
more
dear
a
better
proposer
could
charge
you
withal
be
even
and
direct
with
me
whether
you
were
sent
for
or
no
what
say
you
nay
then
i
have
an
eye
of
you
if
you
love
me
hold
not
off
my
lord
we
were
sent
for
i
will
tell
you
why
so
shall
my
anticipation
prevent
your
discovery
and
your
secrecy
to
the
king
and
queen
moult
no
feather
i
have
of
late
but
wherefore
i
know
not
lost
all
my
mirth
forgone
all
custom
of
exercises
and
indeed
it
goes
so
heavily
with
my
disposition
that
this
goodly
frame
the
earth
seems
to
me
a
sterile
promontory
this
most
excellent
canopy
the
air
look
you
this
brave
oerhanging
firmament
this
majestical
roof
fretted
with
golden
fire
why
it
appears
no
other
thing
to
me
but
a
foul
and
pestilent
congregation
of
vapours
what
a
piece
of
work
is
a
man
how
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculty
in
form
in
moving
how
express
and
admirable
in
action
how
like
an
angel
in
apprehension
how
like
a
god
the
beauty
of
the
world
the
paragon
of
animals
and
yet
to
me
what
is
this
quintessence
of
dust
man
delights
not
me
no
nor
woman
neither
though
by
your
smiling
you
seem
to
say
so
my
lord
there
was
no
such
stuff
in
my
thoughts
why
did
you
laugh
then
when
i
said
man
delights
not
me
to
think
my
lord
if
you
delight
not
in
man
what
lenten
entertainment
the
players
shall
receive
from
you
we
coted
them
on
the
way
and
hither
are
they
coming
to
offer
you
service
he
that
plays
the
king
shall
be
welcome
his
majesty
shall
have
tribute
of
me
the
adventurous
knight
shall
use
his
foil
and
target
the
lover
shall
not
sigh
gratis
the
humorous
man
shall
end
his
part
in
peace
the
clown
shall
make
those
laugh
whose
lungs
are
tickle
o
the
sere
and
the
lady
shall
say
her
mind
freely
or
the
blank
verse
shall
halt
fort
what
players
are
they
even
those
you
were
wont
to
take
delight
in
the
tragedians
of
the
city
how
chances
it
they
travel
their
residence
both
in
reputation
and
profit
was
better
both
ways
i
think
their
inhibition
comes
by
the
means
of
the
late
innovation
do
they
hold
the
same
estimation
they
did
when
i
was
in
the
city
are
they
so
followed
no
indeed
they
are
not
how
comes
it
do
they
grow
rusty
nay
their
endeavour
keeps
in
the
wonted
pace
but
there
is
sir
an
aery
of
children
little
eyases
that
cry
out
on
the
top
of
question
and
are
most
tyrannically
clapped
fort
these
are
now
the
fashion
and
so
berattle
the
common
stages
so
they
call
them
that
many
wearing
rapiers
are
afraid
of
goosequills
and
dare
scarce
come
thither
what
are
they
children
who
maintains
em
how
are
they
escoted
will
they
pursue
the
quality
no
longer
than
they
can
sing
will
they
not
say
afterwards
if
they
should
grow
themselves
to
common
players
as
it
is
most
like
if
their
means
are
no
better
their
writers
do
them
wrong
to
make
them
exclaim
against
their
own
succession
faith
there
has
been
much
todo
on
both
sides
and
the
nation
holds
it
no
sin
to
tarre
them
to
controversy
there
was
for
a
while
no
money
bid
for
argument
unless
the
poet
and
the
player
went
to
cuffs
in
the
question
is
it
possible
o
there
has
been
much
throwing
about
of
brains
do
the
boys
carry
it
away
ay
that
they
do
my
lord
hercules
and
his
load
too
it
is
not
very
strange
for
my
uncle
is
king
of
denmark
and
those
that
would
make
mows
at
him
while
my
father
lived
give
twenty
forty
fifty
a
hundred
ducats
apiece
for
his
picture
in
little
sblood
there
is
something
in
this
more
than
natural
if
philosophy
could
find
it
out
there
are
the
players
gentlemen
you
are
welcome

come
then
the
appurtenance
of
welcome
is
fashion
and
ceremony
let
me
comply
with
you
in
this
garb
lest
my
extent
to
the
players
which
i
tell
you
must
show
fairly
outward
should
more
appear
like
entertainment
than
yours
you

thee

thou
to

me
in

what
my
young
lady
and
mistress
by

your

masters
you
are
all

we
see
well
have
a
speech
straight
come
give
us
a
taste
of
your
quality
come
a
passionate
speech
what
speech
my
good
lord
i
heard
thee
speak
me
a
speech
once
but
it
was
never
acted
or
if
it
was
not
above
once
for
the
play
i
remember
pleased
not
the
million
twas
caviare
to
the
general
but
it
was
as
i
received
it
and
others
whose
judgments
in
such
matters
cried
in
the
top
of
mine
an
excellent
play
well
digested
in
the
scenes
set
down
with
as
much
modesty
as
cunning
i
remember
one
said
there
were
no
sallets
in
the
lines
to
make
the
matter
savoury
nor
no
matter
in
the
phrase
that
might
indict
the
author
of
affectation
but
called
it
an
honest
method
as
wholesome
as
sweet
and
by
very
much
more
handsome
than
fine
one
speech
in
it
i
chiefly
loved
twas
neas
tale
to
dido
and
thereabout
of
it
especially
where
he
speaks
of
priams
slaughter
if
it
live
in
your
memory
begin
at
this
line
let
me
see
let
me
see
therugged
pyrrhus
like
the
hyrcanian
beast
tis
not
so
it
begins
with
pyrrhus
the
rugged
pyrrhus
he
whose
sable
arm
black
as
his
purpose
did
the
night
resemble
when
he
lay
couched
in
the
ominous
horse
hath
now
this
dread
and
black
complexion
smeard
with
heraldry
more
dismal
head
to
foot
now
is
he
total
gules
horridly
trickd
with
blood
of
fathers
mothers
daughters
sons
bakd
and
impasted
with
the
parching
streets
that
lend
a
tyrannous
and
damned
light
to
their
vile
murders
rousted
in
wrath
and
fire
and
thus
oersized
with
coagulate
gore
with
eyes
like
carbuncles
the
hellish
pyrrhus
old
grandsire
priam
seeks
so
proceed
you
fore
god
my
lord
well
spoken
with
good
accent
and
good
discretion
anon
he
finds
him
striking
too
short
at
greeks
his
antique
sword
rebellious
to
his
arm
lies
where
it
falls
repugnant
to
command
unequal
matchd
pyrrhus
at
priam
drives
in
rage
strikes
wide
but
with
the
whiff
and
wind
of
his
fell
sword
the
unnerved
father
falls
then
senseless
ilium
seeming
to
feel
this
blow
with
flaming
top
stoops
to
his
base
and
with
a
hideous
crash
takes
prisoner
pyrrhus
ear
for
lo
his
sword
which
was
declining
on
the
milky
head
of
rever
end
priam
seemd
i
the
air
to
stick
so
as
a
painted
tyrant
pyrrhus
stood
and
like
a
neutral
to
his
will
and
matter
did
nothing
but
as
we
often
see
against
some
storm
a
silence
in
the
heavens
the
rack
stand
still
the
bold
winds
speechless
and
the
orb
below
as
hush
as
death
anon
the
dreadful
thunder
doth
rend
the
region
so
after
pyrrhus
pause
aroused
vengeance
sets
him
new
awork
and
never
did
the
cyclops
hammers
fall
on
marss
armour
forgd
for
proof
eterne
with
less
remorse
than
pyrrhus
bleeding
sword
now
falls
on

out
out
thou

in

synod
take
away

with
his

her

the
instant
burst
of
clamour

lord

the
players
well
bestowed

them
be
well
used
for
they
are
the
abstracts
and
brief
chronicles
of
the
time
after
your
death
you
were
better
have
a
bad
epitaph
than
their
ill
report
while
you
live
my
lord
i
will
use
them
according
to
their
desert
gods
bodikins
man
much
better
use
every
man
after
his
desert
and
who
should
scape
whipping
use
them
after
your

honour
and
dignity
the
less
they

the
more
merit

in
your
bounty

could
for
a
need
study
a
speech
of
some
dozen
or
sixteen
lines
which
i
would
set
down
and
insert
int
could
you
not
ay
my
lord
very
well
follow
that
lord
and
look

lord
ay
so
god
be
wi
ye
now
i
am
alone
o
what
a
rogue
and
peasant
slave
am
i
is
it
not
monstrous
that
this
player
here
but
in
a
fiction
in
a
dream
of
passion
could
force
his
soul
so
to
his
own
conceit
that
from
her
working
all
his
visage
wannd
tears
in
his
eyes
distraction
in
s
aspect
a
broken
voice
and
his
whole
function
suiting
with
forms
to
his
conceit
and
all
for
nothing
for
hecuba
what
s
hecuba
to
him
or
he
to
hecuba
that
he
should
weep
for
her
what
would
he
do
had
he
the
motive
and
the
cue
for
passion
that
i
have
he
would
drown
the
stage
with
tears
and
cleave
the
general
ear
with
horrid
speech
make
mad
the
guilty
and
appal
the
free
confound
the
ignorant
and
amaze
indeed
the
very
faculties
of
eyes
and
ears
yet
i
a
dull
and
muddymettled
rascal
peak
like
johnadreams
unpregnant
of
my
cause
and
can
say
nothing
no
not
for
a
king
upon
whose
property
and
most
dear
life
a
damnd
defeat
was
made
am
i
a
coward
who
calls
me
villain
breaks
my
pate
across
plucks
off
my
beard
and
blows
it
in
my
face
tweaks
me
by
the
nose
gives
me
the
lie
i
the
throat
as
deep
as
to
the
lungs
who
does
me
this
ha
swounds
i
should
take
it
for
it
cannot
be
but
i
am
pigeonliverd
and
lack
gall
to
make
oppression
bitter
or
ere
this
i
should
have
fatted
all
the
region
kites
with
this
slaves
offal
bloody
bawdy
villain
remorseless
treacherous
lecherous
kindless
villain
o
vengeance
why
what
an
ass
am
i
this
is
most
brave
that
i
the
son
of
a
dear
father
murderd
prompted
to
my
revenge
by
heaven
and
hell
must
like
a
whore
unpack
my
heart
with
words
and
fall
acursing
like
a
very
drab
a
scullion
fie
upont
foh
about
my
brain
i
have
heard
that
guilty
creatures
sitting
at
a
play
have
by
the
very
cunning
of
the
scene
been
struck
so
to
the
soul
that
presently
they
have
proclaimd
their
malefactions
for
murder
though
it
have
no
tongue
will
speak
with
most
miraculous
organ
ill
have
these
players
play
something
like
the
murder
of
my
father
before
mine
uncle
ill
observe
his
looks
ill
tent
him
to
the
quick
if
he
but
blench
i
know
my
course
the
spirit
that
i
have
seen
may
be
the
devil
and
the
devil
hath
power
to
assume
a
pleasing
shape
yea
and
perhaps
out
of
my
weakness
and
my
melancholy
as
he
is
very
potent
with
such
spirits
abuses
me
to
damn
me
ill
have
grounds
more
relative
than
this
the
play
s
the
thing
wherein
ill
catch
the
conscience
of
the
king
and
can
you
by
no
drift
of
circumstance
get
from
him
why
he
puts
on
this
confusion
grating
so
harshly
all
his
days
of
quiet
with
turbulent
and
dangerous
lunacy
he
does
confess
he
feels
himself
distracted
but
from
what
cause
he
will
by
no
means
speak
nor
do
we
find
him
forward
to
be
sounded
but
with
a
crafty
madness
keeps
aloof
when
we
would
bring
him
on
to
some
confession
of
his
true
state
did
he
receive
you
well
most
like
a
gentleman
but
with
much
forcing
of
his
disposition
niggard
of
question
but
of
our
demands
most
free
in
his
reply
did
you
assay
him
to
any
pastime
madam
it
so
fell
out
that
certain
players
we
oerraught
on
the
way
of
these
we
told
him
and
there
did
seem
in
him
a
kind
of
joy
to
hear
of
it
they
are
about
the
court
and
as
i
think
they
have
already
order
this
night
to
play
before
him
tis
most
true
and
he
beseechd
me
to
entreat
your
majesties
to
hear
and
see
the
matter
with
all
my
heart
and
it
doth
much
content
me
to
hear
him
so
inclind
good
gentlemen
give
him
a
further
edge
and
drive
his
purpose
on
to
these
delights
we
shall
my
lord
sweet
gertrude
leave
us
too
for
we
have
closely
sent
for
hamlet
hither
that
he
as
twere
by
accident
may
here
affront
ophelia
her
father
and
myself
lawful
espials
will
so
bestow
ourselves
that
seeing
unseen
we
may
of
their
encounter
frankly
judge
and
gather
by
him
as
he
is
behavd
if
t
be
the
affliction
of
his
love
or
no
that
thus
he
suffers
for
i
shall
obey
you
and
for
your
part
ophelia
i
do
wish
that
your
good
beauties
be
the
happy
cause
of
hamlets
wildness
so
shall
i
hope
your
virtues
will
bring
him
to
his
wonted
way
again
to
both
your
honours
madam
i
wish
it
may
ophelia
walk
you
here
gracious
so
please
you
we
will
bestow
ourselves
read
on
this
book
that
show
of
such
an
exercise
may
colour
your
loneliness
we
are
oft
to
blame
in
this
tis
too
much
provd
that
with
devotions
visage
and
pious
action
we
do
sugar
oer
the
devil
himself
o
tis
too
true
how
smart
a
lash
that
speech
doth
give
my
conscience
the
harlots
cheek
beautied
with
plastering
art
is
not
more
ugly
to
the
thing
that
helps
it
than
is
my
deed
to
my
most
painted
word
o
heavy
burden
i
hear
him
coming
lets
withdraw
my
lord
to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
whether
tis
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
or
to
take
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
and
by
opposing
end
them
to
die
to
sleep
no
more
and
by
a
sleep
to
say
we
end
the
heartache
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
that
flesh
is
heir
to
tis
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wishd
to
die
to
sleep
to
sleep
perchance
to
dream
ay
theres
the
rub
for
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
when
we
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
must
give
us
pause
theres
the
respect
that
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
for
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
the
oppressors
wrong
the
proud
mans
contumely
the
pangs
of
disprizd
love
the
laws
delay
the
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
that
patient
merit
of
the
unworthy
takes
when
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
with
a
bare
bodkin
who
would
fardels
bear
to
grunt
and
sweat
under
a
weary
life
but
that
the
dread
of
something
after
death
the
undiscoverd
country
from
whose
bourn
no
traveller
returns
puzzles
the
will
and
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
and
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
is
sicklied
oer
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
and
enterprises
of
great
pith
and
moment
with
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
and
lose
the
name
of
action
soft
you
now
the
fair
ophelia
nymph
in
thy
orisons
be
all
my
sins
rememberd
good
my
lord
how
does
your
honour
for
this
many
a
day
i
humbly
thank
you
well
well
well
my
lord
i
have
remembrances
of
yours
that
i
have
longed
long
to
redeliver
i
pray
you
now
receive
them
no
not
i
i
never
gave
you
aught
my
honourd
lord
you
know
right
well
you
did
and
with
them
words
of
so
sweet
breath
composd
as
made
the
things
more
rich
their
perfume
lost
take
these
again
for
to
the
noble
mind
rich
gifts
wax
poor
when
givers
prove
unkind
there
my
lord
ha
ha
are
you
honest
my
lord
are
you
fair
what
means
your
lordship
that
if
you
be
honest
and
fair
your
honesty
should
admit
no
discourse
to
your
beauty
could
beauty
my
lord
have
better
commerce
than
with
honesty
ay
truly
for
the
power
of
beauty
will
sooner
transform
honesty
from
what
it
is
to
a
bawd
than
the
force
of
honesty
can
translate
beauty
into
his
likeness
this
was
sometime
a
paradox
but
now
the
time
gives
it
proof
i
did
love
thee
once
indeed
my
lord
you
made
me
believe
so
you
should
not
have
believed
me
for
virtue
cannot
so
inoculate
our
old
stock
but
we
shall
relish
of
it
i
loved
you
not
i
was
the
more
deceived
get
thee
to
a
nunnery
why
wouldst
thou
be
a
breeder
of
sinners
i
am
myself
indifferent
honest
but
yet
i
could
accuse
me
of
such
things
that
it
were
better
my
mother
had
not
borne
me
i
am
very
proud
revengeful
ambitious
with
more
offences
at
my
beck
than
i
have
thoughts
to
put
them
in
imagination
to
give
them
shape
or
time
to
act
them
in
what
should
such
fellows
as
i
do
crawling
between
heaven
and
earth
we
are
arrant
knaves
all
believe
none
of
us
go
thy
ways
to
a
nunnery
wheres
your
father
at
home
my
lord
let
the
doors
be
shut
upon
him
that
he
may
play
the
fool
nowhere
but
ins
own
house
farewell
o
help
him
you
sweet
heavens
if
thou
dost
marry
ill
give
thee
this
plague
for
thy
dowry
be
thou
as
chaste
as
ice
as
pure
as
snow
thou
shalt
not
escape
calumny
get
thee
to
a
nunnery
go
farewell
or
if
thou
wilt
needs
marry
marry
a
fool
for
wise
men
know
well
enough
what
monsters
you
make
of
them
to
a
nunnery
go
and
quickly
too
farewell
o
heavenly
powers
restore
him
i
have
heard
of
your
paintings
too
well
enough
god
hath
given
you
one
face
and
you
make
yourselves
another
you
jig
you
amble
and
you
lisp
and
nickname
gods
creatures
and
make
your
wantonness
your
ignorance
go
to
ill
no
more
ont
it
hath
made
me
mad
i
say
we
will
have
no
more
marriages
those
that
are
married
already
all
but
one
shall
live
the
rest
shall
keep
as
they
are
to
a
nunnery
go
o
what
a
noble
mind
is
here
oerthrown
the
courtiers
soldiers
scholars
eye
tongue
sword
the
expectancy
and
rose
of
the
fair
state
the
glass
of
fashion
and
the
mould
of
form
the
observd
of
all
observers
quite
quite
down
and
i
of
ladies
most
deject
and
wretched
that
suckd
the
honey
of
his
music
vows
now
see
that
noble
and
most
sovereign
reason
like
sweet
bells
jangled
out
of
tune
and
harsh
that
unmatchd
form
and
feature
of
blown
youth
blasted
with
ecstasy
o
woe
is
me
to
have
seen
what
i
have
seen
see
what
i
see
love
his
affections
do
not
that
way
tend
nor
what
he
spake
though
it
lackd
form
a
little
was
not
like
madness
theres
something
in
his
soul
oer
which
his
melancholy
sits
on
brood
and
i
do
doubt
the
hatch
and
the
disclose
will
be
some
danger
which
for
to
prevent
i
have
in
quick
determination
thus
set
it
down
he
shall
with
speed
to
england
for
the
demand
of
our
neglected
tribute
haply
the
seas
and
countries
different
with
variable
objects
shall
expel
this
somethingsettled
matter
in
his
heart
whereon
his
brains
still
beating
puts
him
thus
from
fashion
of
himself
what
think
you
ont
it
shall
do
well
but
yet
do
i
believe
the
origin
and
commencement
of
his
grief
sprung
from
neglected
love
how
now
ophelia
you
need
not
tell
us
what
lord
hamlet
said
we
heard
it
all
my
lord
do
as
you
please
but
if
you
hold
it
fit
after
the
play
let
his
queen
mother
all
alone
entreat
him
to
show
his
griefs
let
her
be
round
with
him
and
ill
be
placd
so
please
you
in
the
ear
of
all
their
conference
if
she
find
him
not
to
england
send
him
or
confine
him
where
your
wisdom
best
shall
think
it
shall
be
so
madness
in
great
ones
must
not
unwatchd
go
speak
the
speech
i
pray
you
as
i
pronounced
it
to
you
trippingly
on
the
tongue
but
if
you
mouth
it
as
many
of
your
players
do
i
had
as
lief
the
towncrier
spoke
my
lines
nor
do
not
saw
the
air
too
much
with
your
hand
thus
but
use
all
gently
for
in
the
very
torrent
tempest
and
as
i
may
say
whirlwind
of
passion
you
must
acquire
and
beget
a
temperance
that
may
give
it
smoothness
o
it
offends
me
to
the
soul
to
hear
a
robustious
periwigpated
fellow
tear
a
passion
to
tatters
to
very
rage
to
split
the
ears
of
the
groundlings
who
for
the
most
part
are
capable
of
nothing
but
inexplicable
dumbshows
and
noise
i
would
have
such
a
fellow
whipped
for
oerdoing
termagant
it
outherods
herod
pray
you
avoid
it
i
warrant
your
honour
be
not
too
tame
neither
but
let
your
own
discretion
be
your
tutor
suit
the
action
to
the
word
the
word
to
the
action
with
this
special
observance
that
you
oerstep
not
the
modesty
of
nature
for
anything
so
overdone
is
from
the
purpose
of
playing
whose
end
both
at
the
first
and
now
was
and
is
to
hold
as
twere
the
mirror
up
to
nature
to
show
virtue
her
own
feature
scorn
her
own
image
and
the
very
age
and
body
of
the
time
his
form
and
pressure
now
this
overdone
or
come
tardy
off
though
it
make
the
unskilful
laugh
cannot
but
make
the
judicious
grieve
the
censure
of
which
one
must
in
your
allowance
oerweigh
a
whole
theatre
of
others
o
there
be
players
that
i
have
seen
play
and
heard
others
praise
and
that
highly
not
to
speak
it
profanely
that
neither
having
the
accent
of
christians
nor
the
gait
of
christian
pagan
nor
man
have
so
strutted
and
bellowed
that
i
have
thought
some
of
natures
journeymen
had
made
men
and
not
made
them
well
they
imitated
humanity
so
abominably
i
hope
we
have
reformed
that
indifferently
with
us
o
reform
it
altogether
and
let
those
that
play
your
clowns
speak
no
more
than
is
set
down
for
them
for
there
be
of
them
that
will
themselves
laugh
to
set
on
some
quantity
of
barren
spectators
to
laugh
too
though
in
the
mean
time
some
necessary
question
of
the
play
be
then
to
be
considered
thats
villanous
and
shows
a
most
pitiful
ambition
in
the
fool
that
uses
it
go
make
you
ready
how
now
my
lord
will
the
king
hear
this
piece
of
work
and
the
queen
too
and
that
presently
bid
the
players
make
haste
will
you
two
help
to
hasten
them
we
will
my
lord
we
will
my
lord
what
ho
horatio
here
sweet
lord
at
your
service
horatio
thou
art
een
as
just
a
man
as
eer
my
conversation
copd
withal
o
my
dear
lord
nay
do
not
think
i
flatter
for
what
advancement
may
i
hope
from
thee
that
no
revenue
hast
but
thy
good
spirits
to
feed
and
clothe
thee
why
should
the
poor
be
flatterd
no
let
the
candied
tongue
lick
absurd
pomp
and
crook
the
pregnant
hinges
of
the
knee
where
thrift
may
follow
fawning
dost
thou
hear
since
my
dear
soul
was
mistress
of
her
choice
and
could
of
men
distinguish
her
election
hath
seald
thee
for
herself
for
thou
hast
been
as
one
in
suffering
all
that
suffers
nothing
a
man
that
fortunes
buffets
and
rewards
hast
taen
with
equal
thanks
and
blessd
are
those
whose
blood
and
judgment
are
so
well
comingled
that
they
are
not
a
pipe
for
fortunes

to
sound
what
stop

please
give
me
that
man
that
is
not

slave
and
i
will
wear
him
in
my
hearts
core

my
heart
of
heart
as
i
do
thee
something
too
much
of
this
there
is
a
play

king

scene
of
it
comes
near
the
circumstance
which
i
have
told
thee
of
my
fathers
death
i
prithee
when
thou
seest
that
act
afoot
even
with
the
very
comment
of
thy
soul
observe
mine
uncle
if
his
occulted
guilt
do
not
itself
unkennel
in
one
speech
it
is
a
damned
ghost
that
we
have
seen
and
my
imaginations
are
as
foul
as
vulcans
stithy
give
him
heedful
note
for
i
mine
eyes
will
rivet
to
his
face
and
after
we
will
both
our
judgments
join
in
censure
of
his
seeming
well
my
lord
if
he
steal
aught
the
whilst
this
play
is
playing
and

for
our
tragedy
here
stooping
to
your
clemency
we
beg
your
hearing
patiently
is
this
a
prologue
or
the
posy
of
a
ring
tis
brief
my
lord
as
womans
love
full
thirty
times
hath
ph
bus
cart
gone
round
neptunes
salt
wash
and
tellus
orbed
ground
and
thirty
dozen
moons
with
borrowd
sheen
about
the
world
have
times
twelve
thirties
been
since
love
our
hearts
and
hymen
did
our
hands
unite
commutual
in
most
sacred
bands
so
many
journeys
may
the
sun
and
moon
make
us
again
count
oer
ere
love
be
done
but
woe
is
me
you
are
so
sick
of
late
so
far
from
cheer
and
from
your
former
state
that
i
distrust
you
yet
though
i
distrust
discomfort
you
my
lord
it
nothing
must
for
womens
fear
and
love
holds
quantity
in
neither
aught
or
in
extremity
now
what
my
love
is
proof
hath
made
you
know
and
as
my
love
is
sizd
my
fear
is
so
where
love
is
great
the
littlest
doubts
are
fear
where
little
fears
grow
great
great
love
grows
there
faith
i
must
leave
thee
love
and
shortly
too
my
operant
powers
their
functions
leave
to
do
and
thou
shall
live
in
this
fair
world
behind
honourd
belovd
and
haply
one
as
kind
for
husband
shalt
thou
o
confound
the
rest
such
love
must
needs
be
treason
in
my
breast
in
second
husband
let
me
be
accurst
none
wed
the
second
but
who
killd
the
first
wormwood
wormwood
the
instances
that
second
marriage
move
are
base
respects
of
thrift
but
none
of
love
a
second
time
i
kill
my
husband
dead
when
second
husband
kisses
me
in
bed
i
do
believe
you
think
what
now
you
speak
but
what
we
do
determine
oft
we
break
purpose
is
but
the
slave
to
memory
of
violent
birth
but
poor
validity
which
now
like
fruit
unripe
sticks
on
the

tis
that
we
forget
to
pay
ourselves
what
to
ourselves
is
debt
what
to
ourselves
in
passion
we
propose
the
passion
ending
doth
the

lose
the
violence

their

this

is
not

nor
tis
not

that
even
our

a

hitherto
doth

for
who
not

never

who
in

a

where
i

do
so
contrary
run
that
our

still
are

our

none

think
thou

sir
half

a

one
i
for
thou
dost
know
o
damon
dear
this
realm
dismantled
was
of
jove

and
now
reigns
here
a
very
very
pajock

might
have
rimed
o

horatio
ill
take
the
ghosts
word
for
a
thousand
pound
didst
perceive
very
well
my
lord
upon
the
talk
of
the
poisoning
i
did
very
well
note
him
ah
ha
come
some
music
come
the
recorders
for
if
the
king
like
not
the
comedy
why
then
belike
he
likes
it
not
perdy
come
some
music
good
my
lord
vouchsafe
me
a
word
with
you
sir
a
whole
history
the
king
sir
ay
sir
what
of
him
is
in
his
retirement
marvellous
distempered
with
drink
sir
no
my
lord
rather
with
choler
your
wisdom
should
show
itself
more
richer
to
signify
this
to
his
doctor
for
for
me
to
put
him
to
his
purgation
would
perhaps
plunge
him
into
far
more
choler
good
my
lord
put
your
discourse
into
some
frame
and
start
not
so
wildly
from
my
affair
i
am
tame
sir
pronounce
the
queen
your
mother
in
most
great
affliction
of
spirit
hath
sent
me
to
you
you
are
welcome
nay
good
my
lord
this
courtesy
is
not
of
the
right
breed
if
it
shall
please
you
to
make
me
a
wholesome
answer
i
will
do
your
mothers
commandment
if
not
your
pardon
and
my
return
shall
be
the
end
of
my
business
sir
i
cannot
what
my
lord
make
you
a
wholesome
answer
my
wits
diseased
but
sir
such
answer
as
i
can
make
you
shall
command
or
rather
as
you
say
my
mother
therefore
no
more
but
to
the
matter
my
mother
you
say
then
thus
she
says
your
behaviour
hath
struck
her
into
amasement
and
admiration
o
wonderful
son
that
can
so
astonish
a
mother
but
is
there
no
sequel
at
the
heels
of
this
mothers
admiration
impart
she
desires
to
speak
with
you
in
her
closet
ere
you
go
to
bed
we
shall
obey
were
she
ten
times
our
mother
have
you
any
further
trade
with
us
my
lord
you
once
did
love
me
so
i
do
still
by
these
pickers
and
stealers
good
my
lord
what
is
your
cause
of
distemper
you
do
surely
bar
the
door
upon
your
own
liberty
if
you
deny
your
griefs
to
your
friend
sir
i
lack
advancement
how
can
that
be
when
you
have
the
voice
of
the
king
himself
for
your
succession
in
denmark
ay
sir
but
while
the
grass
grows
the
proverb
is
something
musty
o
the
recorders
let
me
see
one
to
withdraw
with
you
why
do
you
go
about
to
recover
the
wind
of
me
as
if
you
would
drive
me
into
a
toil
o
my
lord
if
my
duty
be
too
bold
my
love
is
too
unmannerly
i
do
not
well
understand
that
will
you
play
upon
this
pipe
my
lord
i
cannot
i
pray
you
believe
me
i
cannot
i
do
beseech
you
i
know
no
touch
of
it
my
lord
tis
as
easy
as
lying
govern
these
ventages
with
your
finger
and
thumb
give
it
breath
with
your
mouth
and
it
will
discourse
most
eloquent
music
look
you
these
are
the
stops
but
these
cannot
i
command
to
any
utterance
of
harmony
i
have
not
the
skill
why
look
you
now
how
unworthy
a
thing
you
make
of
me
you
would
play
upon
me
you
would
seem
to
know
my
stops
you
would
pluck
out
the
heart
of
my
mystery
you
would
sound
me
from
my
lowest
note
to
the
top
of
my
compass
and
there
is
much
music
excellent
voice
in
this
little
organ
yet
cannot
you
make
it
speak
sblood
do
you
think
i
am
easier
to
be
played
on
than
a
pipe
call
me
what
instrument
you
will
though
you
can
fret
me
you
cannot
play
upon
me
god
bless
you
sir
my
lord
the
queen
would
speak
with
you
and
presently
do
you
see
yonder
cloud
thats
almost
in
shape
of
a
camel
by
the
mass
and
tis
like
a
camel
indeed
methinks
it
is
like
a
weasel
it
is
backed
like
a
weasel
or
like
a
whale
very
like
a
whale
then
i
will
come
to
my
mother
by
and
by
they
fool
me
to
the
top
of
my
bent
aloud
i
will
come
by
and
by
i
will
say
so
by
and
by
is
easily
said
leave
me
friends
tis
now
the
very
witching
time
of
night
when
churchyards
yawn
and
hell
itself
breathes
out
contagion
to
this
world
now
could
i
drink
hot
blood
and
do
such
bitter
business
as
the
day
would
quake
to
look
on
soft
now
to
my
mother
o
heart
lose
not
thy
nature
let
not
ever
the
soul
of
nero
enter
this
firm
bosom
let
me
be
cruel
not
unnatural
i
will
speak
daggers
to
her
but
use
none
my
tongue
and
soul
in
this
be
hypocrites
how
in
my
words
soever
she
be
shent
to
give
them
seals
never
my
soul
consent
i
like
him
not
nor
stands
it
safe
with
us
to
let
his
madness
range
therefore
prepare
you
i
your
commission
will
forth
with
dispatch
and
he
to
england
shall
along
with
you
the
terms
of
our
estate
may
not
endure
hazard
so
dangerous
as
doth
hourly
grow
out
of
his
lunacies
we
will
ourselves
provide
most
holy
and
religious
fear
it
is
to
keep
those
many
many
bodies
safe
that
live
and
feed
upon
your
majesty
the
single
and
peculiar
life
is
bound
with
all
the
strength
and
armour
of
the
mind
to
keep
itself
from
noyance
but
much
more
that
spirit
upon
whose
weal
depend
and
rest
the
lives
of
many
the
cease
of
majesty
dies
not
alone
but
like
a
gulf
doth
draw
whats
near
it
with
it
it
is
a
massy
wheel
fixd
on
the
summit
of
the
highest
mount
to
whose
huge
spokes
ten
thousand
lesser
things
are
mortisd
and
adjoind
which
when
it
falls
each
small
annexment
petty
consequence
attends
the
boisterous
ruin
never
alone
did
the
king
sigh
but
with
a
general
groan
arm
you
i
pray
you
to
this
speedy
voyage
for
we
will
fetters
put
upon
this
fear
which
now
goes
too
freefooted
we
will
haste
us
we
will
haste
us
my
lord
hes
going
to
his
mothers
closet
behind
the
arras
ill
convey
myself
to
hear
the
process
ill
warrant
shell
tax
him
home
and
as
you
said
and
wisely
was
it
said
tis
meet
that
some
more
audience
than
a
mother
since
nature
makes
them
partial
should
oerhear
the
speech
of
vantage
fare
you
well
my
liege
ill
call
upon
you
ere
you
go
to
bed
and
tell
you
what
i
know
thanks
dear
my
lord
o
my
offence
is
rank
it
smells
to
heaven
it
hath
the
primal
eldest
curse
upont
a
brothers
murder
pray
can
i
not
though
inclination
be
as
sharp
as
will
my
stronger
guilt
defeats
my
strong
intent
and
like
a
man
to
double
business
bound
i
stand
in
pause
where
i
shall
first
begin
and
both
neglect
what
if
this
cursed
hand
were
thicker
than
itself
with
brothers
blood
is
there
not
rain
enough
in
the
sweet
heavens
to
wash
it
white
as
snow
whereto
serves
mercy
but
to
confront
the
visage
of
offence
and
whats
in
prayer
but
this
twofold
force
to
be
forestalled
ere
we
come
to
fall
or
pardond
being
down
then
ill
look
up
my
fault
is
past
but
o
what
form
of
prayer
can
serve
my
turn
forgive
me
my
foul
murder
that
cannot
be
since
i
am
still
possessd
of
those
effects
for
which
i
did
the
murder
my
crown
mine
own
ambition
and
my
queen
may
one
be
pardond
and
retain
the
offence
in
the
corrupted
currents
of
this
world
offences
gilded
hand
may
shove
by
justice
and
oft
tis
seen
the
wicked
prise
itself
buys
out
the
law
but
tis
not
so
above
there
is
no
shuffling
there
the
action
lies
in
his
true
nature
and
we
ourselves
compelld
even
to
the
teeth
and
forehead
of
our
faults
to
give
in
evidence
what
then
what
rests
try
what
repentance
can
what
can
it
not
yet
what
can
it
when
one
can
not
repent
o
wretched
state
o
bosom
black
as
death
o
limed
soul
that
struggling
to
be
free
art
more
engaged
help
angels
make
assay
bow
stubborn
knees
and
heart
with
strings
of
steel
be
soft
as
sinews
of
the
newborn
babe
all
may
be
well
now
might
i
do
it
pat
now
he
is
praying
and
now
ill
dot
and
so
he
goes
to
heaven
and
so
am
i
revengd
that
would
be
scannd
a
villain
kills
my
father
and
for
that
i
his
sole
son
do
this
same
villain
send
to
heaven
why
this
is
hire
and
salary
not
revenge
he
took
my
father
grossly
full
of
bread
with
all
his
crimes
broad
blown
as
flush
as
may
and
how
his
audit
stands
who
knows
save
heaven
but
in
our
circumstance
and
course
of
thought
tis
heavy
with
him
and
am
i
then
revengd
to
take
him
in
the
purging
of
his
soul
when
he
is
fit
and
seasond
for
his
passage
no
up
sword
and
know
thou
a
more
horrid
hent
when
he
is
drunk
asleep
or
in
his
rage
or
in
the
incestuous
pleasure
of
his
bed
at
gaming
swearing
or
about
some
act
that
has
no
relish
of
salvation
int
then
trip
him
that
his
heels
may
kick
at
heaven
and
that
his
soul
may
be
as
damnd
and
black
as
hell
whereto
it
goes
my
mother
stays
this
physic
but
prolongs
thy
sickly
days
my
words
fly
up
my
thoughts
remain
below
words
without
thoughts
never
to
heaven
go
he
will
come
straight
look
you
lay
home
to
him
tell
him
his
pranks
have
been
too
broad
to
bear
with
and

your
grace
hath
screend
and
stood
between
much
heat
and

bulwark
against

done
that
thou

thy
tongue
in
noise
so
rude
against
me
such
an
act
that
blurs
the
grace
and
blush
of
modesty
calls
virtue
hypocrite
takes
off
the
rose
from
the
fair
forehead
of
an
innocent
love
and
sets
a
blister
there
makes
marriage
vows
as
false
as
dicers
oaths
o
such
a
deed
as
from
the
body
of
contraction
plucks
the
very
soul
and
sweet
religion
makes
a
rhapsody
of
words
heavens

act
that
roars
so
loud
and
thunders
in
the
index
look
here
upon
this
picture
and
on
this
the
counterfeit
presentment
of
two
brothers
see
what
a
grace
was
seated
on
this
brow
hyperions
curls
the
front
of
jove
himself
an
eye
like
mars
to
threaten
and
command
a
station
like
the
herald
mercury
newlighted
on
a
heavenkissing
hill
a
combination
and
a
form
indeed
where
every
god
did
seem
to
set
his
seal
to
give
the
world
assurance
of
a
man
this
was
your
husband
look
you
now
what
follows
here
is
your
husband
like
a
mildewd
ear
blasting
his
wholesome
brother
have
you
eyes
could
you
on
this
fair
mountain
leave
to
feed
and
batten
on
this
moor
ha
have
you
eyes
you
cannot
call
it
love
for
at
your
age
the
heyday
in
the
blood
is
tame
its
humble
and
waits
upon
the
judgment
and
what
judgment
would
step
from
this
to
this
sense
sure
you
have
else
could
you
not
have
motion
but
sure
that
sense
is
apoplexd
for
madness
would
not
err
nor
sense
to
ecstasy
was
neer
so
thralld
but
it
reservd
some
quantity
of
choice
to
serve
in
such
a
difference
what
devil
was
t
that
thus
hath
comend
you
at
hoodmanblind
eyes
without
feeling
feeling
without
sight
ears
without
hands
or
eyes
smelling
sans
all
or
but
a
sickly
part
of
one
true
sense
could
not
so
mope
o
shame
where
is
thy
blush
rebellious
hell
if
thou
canst
mutine
in
a
matrons
bones
to
flaming
youth
let
virtue
be
as
wax
and
melt
in
her
own
fire
proclaim
no
shame
when
the
compulsive
ardour
gives
the
charge
since
first
itself
as
actively
doth
burn
and
reason
panders
will
o
hamlet
speak
no
more
thou
turnst
mine
eyes
into
my
very
soul
and
there
i
see
such
black
and
grained
spots
as
will
not
leave
their
tinct
nay
but
to
live
in
the
rank
sweat
of
an
enseamed
bed
stewd
in
corruption
honeying
and
making
love
over
the
nasty
sty
o
speak
to
me
no
more
these
words
like
daggers
enter
in
mine
ears
no
more
sweet
hamlet
a
murderer
and
a
villain
a
slave
that
is
not
twentieth
part
the
tithe
of
your
precedent
lord
a
vice
of
kings
a
cutpurse
of
the
empire
and
the
rule
that
from
a
shelf
the
precious
diadem
stole
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
no
more
a
king
of
shreds
and
patches
save
me
and
hover
oer
me
with
your
wings
you
heavenly
guards
what
would
your
gracious
figure
alas
hes
mad
do
you
not
come
your
tardy
son
to
chide
that
lapsd
in
time
and
passion
lets
go
by
the
important
acting
of
your
dread
command
o
say
do
not
forget
this
visitation
is
but
to
whet
thy
almost
blunted
purpose
but
look
amazement
on
thy
mother
sits
o
step
between
her
and
her
fighting
soul
conceit
in
weakest
bodies
strongest
works
speak
to
her
hamlet
how
is
it
with
you
lady
alas
how
ist
with
you
that
you
do
bend
your
eye
on
vacancy
and
with
the
incorporal
air
do
hold
discourse
forth
at
your
eyes
your
spirits
wildly
peep
and
as
the
sleeping
soldiers
in
the
alarm
your
bedded
hair
like
life
in
excrements
starts
up
and
stands
an
end
o
gentle
son
upon
the
heat
and
flame
of
thy
distemper
sprinkle
cool
patience
whereon
do
you
look
on
him
on
him
look
you
how
pale
he
glares
his
form
and
cause
conjoind
preaching
to
stones
would
make
them
capable
do
not
look
upon
me
lest
with
this
piteous
action
you
convert
my
stern
effects
then
what
i
have
to
do
will
want
true
colour
tears
perchance
for
blood
to
whom
do
you
speak
this
do
you
see
nothing
there
nothing
at
all
yet
all
that
is
i
see
nor
did
you
nothing
hear
no
nothing
but
ourselves
why
look
you
there
look
how
it
steals
away
my
father
in
his
habit
as
he
livd
look
where
he
goes
even
now
out
at
the
portal
this
is
the
very
coinage
of
your
brain
this
bodiless
creation
ecstasy
is
very
cunning
in
ecstasy
my
pulse
as
yours
doth
temperately
keep
time
and
makes
as
healthful
music
it
is
not
madness
that
i
have
utterd
bring
me
to
the
test
and
i
the
matter
will
reword
which
madness
would
gambol
from
mother
for
love
of
grace
lay
not
that
flattering
unction
to
your
soul
that
not
your
trespass
but
my
madness
speaks
it
will
but
skin
and
film
the
ulcerous
place
whiles
rank
corruption
mining
all
within
infects
unseen
confess
yourself
to
heaven
repent
whats
past
avoid
what
is
to
come
and
do
not
spread
the
compost
on
the
weeds
to
make
them
ranker
forgive
me
this
my
virtue
for
in
the
fatness
of
these
pursy
times
virtue
itself
of
vice
must
pardon
beg
yea
curb
and
woo
for
leave
to
do
him
good
o
hamlet
thou
hast
cleft
my
heart
in
twain
o
throw
away
the
worser
part
of
it
and
live
the
purer
with
the
other
half
good
night
but
go
not
to
mine
uncles
bed
assume
a
virtue
if
you
have
it
not
that
monster
custom
who
all
sense
doth
eat
of
habits
devil
is
angel
yet
in
this
that
to
the
use
of
actions
fair
and
good
he
likewise
gives
a
frock
or
livery
that
aptly
is
put
on
refrain
tonight
and
that
shall
lend
a
kind
of
easiness
to
the
next
abstinence
the
next
more
easy
for
use
almost
can
change
the
stamp
of
nature
and
master
evn
the
devil
or
throw
him
out
with
wondrous
potency
once
more
goodnight
and
when
you
are
desirous
to
be
blessd
ill
blessing
beg
of
you
for
this
same
lord
i
do
repent
but
heaven
hath
pleasd
it
so
to
punish
me
with
this
and
this
with
me
that
i
must
be
their
scourge
and
minister
i
will
bestow
him
and
will
answer
well
the
death
i
gave
him
so
again
goodnight
i
must
be
cruel
only
to
be
kind
thus
bad
begins
and
worse
remains
behind
one
word
more
good
lady
what
shall
i
do
not
this
by
no
means
that
i
bid
you
do
let
the
bloat
king
tempt
you
again
to
bed
pinch
wanton
on
your
cheek
call
you
his
mouse
and
let
him
for
a
pair
of
reechy
kisses
or
paddling
in
your
neck
with
his
damnd
fingers
make
you
to
ravel
all
this
matter
out
that
i
essentially
am
not
in
madness
but
mad
in
craft
twere
good
you
let
him
know
for
who
thats
but
a
queen
fair
sober
wise
would
from
a
paddock
from
a
bat
a
gib
such
dear
concernings

would
do
so
no
in
despite
of
sense
and
secrecy
unpeg
the
basket
on
the
houses
top
let
the
birds
fly
and
like
the
famous
ape
to
try
conclusions
in
the
basket
creep
and
break
your
own
neck
down
be
thou
assurd
if

made
of

while

tonight
what
gertrude

does
hamlet
mad
as
the
sea
and
wind
when
both
contend
which
is
the
mightier
in
his
lawless
fit
behind
the
arras
hearing
something
stir
whips
out
his
rapier
cries
a
rat
a
rat
and
in
his
brainish
apprehension
kills
the
unseen
good
old
man
o
heavy
deed
it
had
been
so
with
us
had
we
been
there
his
liberty
is
full
of
threats
to
all
to
you
yourself
to
us
to
every
one
alas
how
shall
this
bloody
deed
be
answerd
it
will
be
laid
to
us
whose
providence
should
have
kept
short
restraind
and
out
of
haunt
this
mad
young
man
but
so
much
was
our
love
we
would
not
understand
what
was
most
fit
but
like
the
owner
of
a
foul
disease
to
keep
it
from
divulging
let
it
feed
even
on
the
pith
of
life
where
is
he
gone
to
draw
apart
the
body
he
hath
killd
oer
whom
his
very
madness
like
some
ore
among
a
mineral
of
metals
base
shows
itself
pure
he
weeps
for
what
is
done
o
gertrude
come
away
the
sun
no
sooner
shall
the
mountains
touch
but
we
will
ship
him
hence
and
this
vile
deed
we
must
with
all
our
majesty
and
skill
both
countenance
and
excuse
ho
guildenstern
friends
both
go
join
you
with
some
further
aid

our
wisest
friends
and
let

and
whats
untimely
done
so
haply
slander
whose
whisper
oer
the
worlds
diameter
as
level
as
the
cannon
to
his
blank
transports
his
poisond
shot
may
miss
our
name
and
hit
the
woundless
air
o
come

my
soul
is
full
of
discord
and
dismay
safely
stowed
hamlet

with
dust
whereto
tis
kin
tell
us
where
tis
that
we
may
take
it
thence
and
bear
it
to
the
chapel
do
not
believe
it
believe
what
that
i
can
keep
your
counsel
and
not
mine
own
besides
to
be
demanded
of
a
sponge
what
replication
should
be
made
by
the
son
of
a
king
take
you
me
for
a
sponge
my
lord
ay
sir
that
soaks
up
the
kings
countenance
his
rewards
his
authorities
but
such
officers
do
the
king
best
service
in
the
end
he
keeps
them
like
an
ape
in
the
corner
of
his
jaw
first
mouthed
to
be
last
swallowed
when
he
needs
what
you
have
gleaned
it
is
but
squeezing
you
and
sponge
you
shall
be
dry
again
i
understand
you
not
my
lord
i
am
glad
of
it
a
knavish
speech
sleeps
in
a
foolish
ear
my
lord
you
must
tell
us
where
the
body
is
and
go
with
us
to
the
king
the
body
is
with
the
king
but
the
king

a
thing

thing

nothing
bring
me
to
him
hide
fox
and
all
after
i
have
sent
to
seek
him
and
to
find
the
body
how
dangerous
is
it
that
this
man
goes
loose
yet
must
not
we
put
the
strong
law
on
him
hes
lovd
of
the
distracted
multitude
who
like
not
in
their
judgment
but
their
eyes
and
where
tis
so
the
offenders
scourge
is
weighd
but
never
the
offence
to
bear
all
smooth
and
even
this
sudden
sending
him
away
must
seem
deliberate
pause
diseases
desperate
grown
by
desperate
appliance
are
relievd
or
not
at
all
how
now
what
hath
befalln
where
the
dead
body
is
bestowd
my
lord

of
the
fish
that

fed
of
that
worm

progress

thither
to
see
if

man
if
his
chief
good
and
market
of
his
time
be
but
to
sleep
and
feed
a
beast
no
more
sure
he
that
made
us
with
such
large
discourse
looking
before
and
after
gave
us
not
that
capability
and
godlike
reason
to
fust
in
us
unusd
now
wher
it
be
bestial
oblivion
or
some
craven
scruple
of
thinking
too
precisely
on
the
event
a
thought
which
quarterd
hath
but
one
part
wisdom
and
ever
three
parts
coward
i
do
not
know
why
yet
i
live
to
say
this
things
to
do
sith
i
have
cause
and
will
and
strength
and
means
to
do
t
examples
gross
as
earth
exhort
me
witness
this
army
of
such
mass
and
charge
led
by
a
delicate
and
tender
prince
whose
spirit
with
divine
ambition
puffd
makes
mouths
at
the
invisible
event
exposing
what
is
mortal
and
unsure
to
all
that
fortune
death
and
danger
dare
even
for
an
eggshell
rightly
to
be
great
is
not
to
stir
without
great
argument
but
greatly
to
find
quarrel
in
a
straw
when
honours
at
the
stake
how
stand
i
then
that
have
a
father
killd
a
mother
staind
excitements
of
my
reason
and
my
blood
and
let
all
sleep
while
to
my
shame
i
see
the
imminent
death
of
twenty
thousand
men
that
for
a
fantasy
and
trick
of
fame
go
to
their
graves
like
beds
fight
for
a
plot
whereon
the
numbers
cannot
try
the
cause
which
is
not
tomb
enough
and
continent
to
hide
the
slaim
o
from
this
time
forth
my
thoughts
be
bloody
or
be
nothing
worth
i
will
not
speak
with
her
she
is
importunate
indeed
distract
her
mood
will
needs
be
pitied
what
would
she
have
she
speaks
much
of
her
father
says
she
hears
theres
tricks
i
the
world
and
hems
and
beats
her
heart
spurns
enviously
at
straws
speaks
things
in
doubt
that
carry
but
half
sense
her
speech
is
nothing
yet
the
unshaped
use
of
it
doth
move
the
hearers
to
collection
they
aim
at
it
and
botch
the
words
up
fit
to
their
own
thoughts
which
as
her
winks
and
nods
and
gestures
yield
them
indeed
would
make
one
think
there
might
be
thought
though
nothing
sure
yet
much
unhappily
twere
good
she
were
spoken
with
for
she
may
strew
dangerous
conjectures
in
illbreeding
minds
let
her
come
in
to
my
sick
soul
as
sins
true
nature
is
each
toy
seems
prologue
to
some
great
amiss
so
full
of
artless
jealousy
is
guilt
it
spills
itself
in
fearing
to
be
spilt
where
is
the
beauteous
majesty
of
denmark
how
now
ophelia
how
should
i
your
true
love
know
from
another
one
by
his
cockle
hat
and
staff
and
his
sandal
shoon
alas
sweet
lady

imports
this
song
say

his
shroud
as

greenly
in

fair
judgment
without

much
containing
as
all
these
her
brother
is
in
secret
come
from
france
feeds
on
his
wonder
keeps
himself
in
clouds
and
wants
not
buzzers
to
infect
his
ear
with
pestilent
speeches
of
his
fathers
death
wherein
necessity
of
matter
beggard
will
nothing
stick
our

to
arraign
in

formal
ostentation
cry
to

that

speak
with
me
sailors
sir

they
have
letters
for
you
let
them
come
in
i
do
not
know
from
what
part
of
the
world
i
should
be
greeted
if
not
from
lord
hamlet
god
bless
you
sir
let
him
bless
thee
too
he
shall
sir
ant
please

theres
a
letter
for
you
sir
it
comes
from
the
ambassador
that
was
bound
for
england
if
your
name
be
horatio
as
i
am
let
to
know
it
is
horatio
when
thou
shalt
have
overlooked
this
give
these
fellows
some
means
to
the
king
they
have
letters
for
him
ere
we
were
two
days
old
at
sea
a
pirate
of
very
warlike
appointment
gave
us
chase
finding
ourselves
too
slow
of
sail
we
put
on
a
compelled
valour
in
the
grapple
i
boarded
them
on
the
instant
they
got
clear
of
our
ship
so
i
alone
became
their
prisoner
they
have
dealt
with
me
like
thieves
of
mercy
but
they
knew
what
they
did
i
am
to
do
a
good
turn
for
them
let
the
king
have
the
letters
i
have
sent
and
repair
thou
to
me
with
as
much
haste
as
thou
wouldst
fly
death
i
have
words
to
speak
in
thine
ear
will
make
thee
dumb
yet
are
they
much
too
light
for
the
bore
of
the
matter
these
good
fellows
will
bring
thee
where
i
am
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
hold
their
course
for
england
of
them
i
have
much
to
tell
thee
farewell
he
that
thou
knowest
thine
come
i
will
give
you
way
for
these
your
letters
and
do
t
the
speedier
that
you
may
direct
me
to
him
from
whom
you
brought
them
now
must
your
conscience
my
acquittance
seal
and
you
must
put
me
in
your
heart
for
friend
sith
you
have
heard
and
with
a
knowing
ear
that
he
which
hath
your
noble
father
slain
pursud
my
life
it
well
appears
but
tell
me
why
you
proceeded
not
against
these
feats
so
crimeful
and
so
capital
in
nature
as
by
your
safety
wisdom
all
things
else
you
mainly
were
stirrd
up
o
for
two
special
reasons
which
may
to
you
perhaps
seem
much
unsinewd
but
yet
to
me
they
are
strong
the
queen
his
mother
lives
almost
by
his
looks
and
for
myself
my
virtue
or
my
plague
be
it
either
which
shes
so
conjunctive
to
my
life
and
soul
that
as
the
star
moves
not
but
in
his
sphere
i
could
not
but
by
her
the
other
motive
why
to
a
public
count
i
might
not
go
is
the
great
love
the
general
gender
bear
him
who
dipping
all
his
faults
in
their
affection
would
like
the
spring
that
turneth
wood
to
stone
convert
his
gyves
to
graces
so
that
my
arrows
too
slightly
timberd
for
so
loud
a
wind
would
have
reverted
to
my
bow
again
and
not
where
i
had
aimd
them
and
so
have
i
a
noble
father
lost
a
sister
driven
into
desperate
terms
whose
worth
if
praises
may
go
back
again
stood
challenger
on
mount
of
all
the
age
for
her
perfections
but
my
revenge
will
come
break
not
your
sleeps
for
that
you
must
not
think
that
we
are
made
of
stuff
so
flat
and
dull
that
we
can
let
our
beard
be
shook
with
danger
and
think
it
pastime
you
shortly
shall
hear
more
i
lovd
your
father
and
we
love
ourself
and
that
i
hope
will
teach
you
to
imagine
how
now
what
news
letters
my
lord
from
hamlet
this
to
your
majesty
this
to
the
queen
from
hamlet
who
brought
them
sailors
my
lord
they
say
i
saw
them
not
they
were
given
me
by
claudio
he
receivd
them
of
him
that
brought
them
laertes
you
shall
hear
them
leave
us
high
and
mighty
you
shall
know
i
am
set
naked
on
your
kingdom
tomorrow
shall
i
beg
leave
to
see
your
kingly
eyes
when
i
shall
first
asking
your
pardon
thereunto
recount
the
occasions
of
my
sudden
and
more
strange
return
what
should
this
mean
are
all
the
rest
come
back
or
is
it
some
abuse
and
no
such
thing
know
you
the
hand
tis
hamlets
character
naked
and
in
a
postscript
here
he
says
alone
can
you
advise
me
im
lost
in
it
my
lord
but
let
him
come
it
warms
the
very
sickness
in
my
heart
that
i
shall
live
and
tell
him
to
his
teeth
thus
diddest
thou
if
it
be
so
laertes
as
how
should
it
be
so
how
otherwise
will
you
be
ruld
by
me
ay
my
lord
so
you
will
not
oerrule
me
to
a
peace
to
thine
own
peace
if
he
be
now
returnd
as
checking
at
his
voyage
and
that
he
means
no
more
to
undertake
it
i
will
work
him
to
an
exploit
now
ripe
in
my
device
under
the
which
he
shall
not
choose
but
fall
and
for
his
death
no
wind
of
blame
shall
breathe
but
even
his
mother
shall
uncharge
the
practice
and
call
it
accident
my
lord
i
will
be
ruld
the
rather
if
you
could
devise
it
so
that
i
might
be
the
organ
it
falls
right
you
have
been
talkd
of
since
your
travel
much
and
that
in
hamlets
hearing
for
a
quality
wherein
they
say
you
shine
your
sum
of
parts
did
not
together
pluck
such
envy
from
him
as
did
that
one
and
that
in
my
regard
of
the
unworthiest
siege
what
part
is
that
my
lord
a
very
riband
in
the
cap
of
youth
yet
needful
too
for
youth
no
less
becomes
the
light
and
careless
livery
that
it
wears
than
settled
age
his
sables
and
his
weeds
importing
health
and
graveness
two
months
since
here
was
a
gentleman
of
normandy
ive
seen
myself
and
servd
against
the
french
and
they
can
well
on
horseback
but
this
gallant
had
witchcraft
in
t
he
grew
unto
his
seat
and
to
such
wondrous
doing
brought
his
horse
as
he
had
been
incorpsd
and
deminaturd
with
the
brave
beast
so
far
he
toppd
my
thought
that
i
in
forgery
of
shapes
and
tricks
come
short
of
what
he
did
a
norman
was
t
a
norman
upon
my
life
lamord
the
very
same
i
know
him
well
he
is
the
brooch
indeed
and
gem
of
all
the
nation
he
made
confession
of
you
and
gave
you
such
a
masterly
report
for
art
and
exercise
in
your
defence
and
for
your
rapier
most
especially
that
he
cried
out
twould
be
a
sight
indeed
if
one
could
match
you
the
scrimers
of
their
nation
he
swore
had
neither
motion
guard
nor
eye
if
you
opposd
them
sir
this
report
of
his
did
hamlet
so
envenom
with
his
envy
that
he
could
nothing
do
but
wish
and
beg
your
sudden
coming
oer
to
play
with
him
now
out
of
this
what
out
of
this
my
lord
laertes
was
your
father
dear
to
you
or
are
you
like
the
painting
of
a
sorrow
a
face
without
a
heart
why
ask
you
this
not
that
i
think
you
did
not
love
your
father
but
that
i
know
love
is
begun
by
time
and
that
i
see
in
passages
of
proof
time
qualifies
the
spark
and
fire
of
it
there
lives
within
the
very
flame
of
love
a
kind
of
wick
or
snuff
that
will
abate
it
and
nothing
is
at
a
like
goodness
still
for
goodness
growing
to
a
plurisy
dies
in
his
own
toomuch
that
we
would
do
we
should
do
when
we
would
for
this
would
changes
and
hath
abatements
and
delays
as
many
as
there
are
tongues
are
hands
are
accidents
and
then
this
should
is
like
a
spendthrift
sigh
that
hurts
by
easing
but
to
the
quick
o
the
ulcer
hamlet
comes
back
what
would
you
undertake
to
show
yourself
your
fathers
son
in
deed
more
than
in
words
to
cut
his
throat
i
the
church
no
place
indeed
should
murder
sanctuarize
revenge
should
have
no
bounds
but
good
laertes
will
you
do
this
keep
close
within
your
chamber
hamlet
returnd
shall
know
you
are
come
home
well
put
on
those
shall
praise
your
excellence
and
set
a
double
varnish
on
the
fame
the
frenchman
gave
you
bring
you
in
fine
together
and
wager
on
your
heads
he
being
remise
most
generous
and
free
from
all
contriving
will
not
peruse
the
foils
so
that
with
ease
or
with
a
little
shuffling
you
may
choose
a
sword
unbated
and
in
a
pass
of
practice
requite
him
for
your
father
i
will
do
t
and
for
that
purpose
ill
anoint
my
sword
i
bought
an
unction
of
a
mountebank
so
mortal
that
but
dip
a
knife
in
it
where
it
draws
blood
no
cataplasm
so
rare
collected
from
all
simples
that
have
virtue
under
the
moon
can
save
the
thing
from
death
that
is
but
scratchd
withal
ill
touch
my
point
with
this
contagion
that
if
i
gall
him
slightly
it
may
be
death
lets
further
think
of
this
weigh
what
convenience
both
of
time
and
means
may
fit
us
to
our
shape
if
this
should
fail
and
that
our
drift
look
through
our
bad
performance
twere
better
not
assayd
therefore
this
project
should
have
a
back
or
second
that
might
hold
if
this
should
blast
in
proof
soft
let
me
see
well
make
a
solemn
wager
on
your
cunnings
i
hat
when
in
your
motion
you
are
hot
and
dry
as
make
your
bouts
more
violent
to
that
end
and
that
he
calls
for
drink
ill
have
prepard
him
a
chalice
for
the
nonce
whereon
but
sipping
if
he
by
chance
escape
your
venomd
stuck
our
purpose
may
hold
there
but
stay
what
noise
how
now
sweet
queen
one
woe
doth
tread
upon
anothers
heel
so
fast
they
follow
your
sisters
drownd
laertes
drownd
o
where
there
is
a
willow
grows
aslant
a
brook
that
shows
his
hoar
leaves
in
the
glassy
stream
there
with
fantastic
garlands
did
she
come
of
crowflowers
nettles
daisies
and
long
purples
that
liberal
shepherds
give
a
grosser
name
but
our
cold
maids
do
dead
mens
fingers
call
them
there
on
the
pendent
boughs
her
coronet
weeds
clambering
to
hang
an
envious
sliver
broke
when
down
her
weedy
trophies
and
herself
fell
in
the
weeping
brook
her
clothes
spread
wide
and
mermaidlike
awhile
they
bore
her
up
which
time
she
chanted
snatches
of
old
tunes
as
one
incapable
of
her
own
distress
or
like
a
creature
native
and
indud
unto
that
element
but
long
it
could
not
be
till
that
her
garments
heavy
with
their
drink
pulld
the
poor
wretch
from
her
melodious
lay
to
muddy
death
alas
then
she
is
drownd
drownd
drownd
too
much
of
water
hast
thou
poor
ophelis
and
therefore
i
forbid
my
tears
but
yet
it
is
our
trick
nature
her
custom
holds
let
shame
say
what
it
will
when
these
are
gone
the
woman
will
be
out
adieu
my
lord
i
have
a
speech
of
fire
that
fain
would
blaze
but
that
this
folly
douts
it
lets
follow
gertrude
how
much
i
had
to
do
to
calm
his
rage
now
fear
i
this
will
give
it
start
again
therefore
lets
follow
is
she
to
be
buried
in
christian
burial
that
wilfully
seeks
her
own
salvation
i
tell
thee
she
is
and
therefore
make
her
grave
straight
the
crowner
hath
sat
on
her
and
finds
it
christian
burial
how
can
that
be
unless
she
drowned
herself
in
her
own
defence
why
tis
found
so
it
must
be
se
offendendo
it
cannot
be
else
for
here
lies
the
point
if
i
drown
myself
wittingly
it
argues
an
act
and
an
act
hath
three
branches
it
is
to
act
to
do
and
to
perform
argal
she
drowned
herself
wittingly
nay
but
hear
you
goodman
delver
give
me
leave
here
lies
the
water
good
here
stands
the
man
good
if
the
man
go
to
this
water
and
drown
himself
it
is
will
he
nill
he
he
goes
mark
you
that
but
if
the
water
come
to
him
and
drown
him
he
drowns
not
himself
argal
he
that
is
not
guilty
of
his
own
death
shortens
not
his
own
life
but
is
this
law
ay
marry
is
t
crowners
quest
law
will
you
ha
the
truth
on
t
if
this
had
not
been
a
gentlewoman
she
should
have
been
buried
out
o
christian
burial
why
there
thou
sayest
and
the
more
pity
that
great
folk
should
have
countenance
in
this
world
to
drown
or
hang
themselves
more
than
their
even
christian
come
my
spade
there
is
no
ancient
gentlemen
but
gardeners
ditchers
and
gravemakers
they
hold
up
adams
profession
was
he
a
gentleman
a
was
the
first
that
ever
bore
arms
why
he
had
none
what
art
a
heathen
how
dost
thou
understand
the
scripture
the
scripture
says
adam
digged
could
be
dig
without
arms
ill
put
another
question
to
thee
if
thou
answerest
me
not
to
the
purpose
confess
thyself
go
to
what
is
he
that
builds
stronger
than
either
the
mason
the
shipwright
or
the
carpenter
the
gallowsmaker
for
that
frame
outlives
a
thousand
tenants
i
like
thy
wit
well
in
good
faith
the
gallows
does
well
but
how
does
it
well
it
does
well
to
those
that
do
ill
now
thou
dost
ill
to
say
the
gallows
is
built
stronger
than
the
church
argal
the
gallows
may
do
well
to
thee
to
t
again
come
who
builds
stronger
than
a
mason
a
shipwright
or
a
carpenter
ay
tell
me
that
and
unyoke
marry
now
i
can
tell
to
t
mass

cannot
tell
cudgel
thy
brains

more
about
it
for
your
dull
ass
will
not
mend
his
pace
with
beating
and
when

are
asked
this
question
next

gravemaker

he
makes

go
get

made
it
in
him
a
property
of
easiness

een
so
the
hand
of
little
employment

the
daintier
sense
but
age
with
his
stealing
steps
hath
clawd
me
in
his
clutch
and
hath
shipped
me
intil
the
land
as
if
i
had
never
been
such
that
skull
had
a
tongue
in
it
and
could
sing
once
how
the
knave
jowls

of

card
or
equivocation

undo
us
by
the
lord
horatio
these
three
years
i
have
taken
note
of
it
the
age
is
grown
so
picked
that
the
toe
of
the
peasant
comes
so
near
the
heel
of
the
courtier
he
galls
his
kibe
how
long
hast
thou
been
a
gravemaker
of
all
the
days
i
the
year
i
came
to
t
that
day
that
our
last
king
hamlet
overcame
fortinbras
how
long
is
that
since
cannot
you
tell
that
every
fool
can
tell
that
it
was
the
very
day
that
young
hamlet
was
born
he
that
is
mad
and
sent
into
england
ay
marry
why
was
he
sent
into
england
why
because
he
was
mad
he
shall
recover
his
wits
there
or
if
he
do
not
tis
no
great
matter
there
why
twill
not
be
seen
in
him
there
there
the
men
are
as
mad
as
he
how
came
he
mad
very
strangely
they
say
how
strangely
faith
een
with
losing
his
wits
upon
what
ground
why
here
in
denmark
i
have
been
sexton
here
man
and
boy
thirty
years
how
long
will
a
man
lie
i
the
earth
ere
he
rot
faith
if
he
be
not
rotten
before
he
die
as
we
have
many
pocky
corses
nowadays
that
will
scarce
hold
the
laying
in
he
will
last
you
some
eight
year
or
nine
year
a
tanner
will
last
you
nine
year
why
he
more
than
another
why
sir
his
hide
is
so
tanned
with
his
trade
that
he
will
keep

water
a
great
while
and

head
once
this

skull
sir
was
yoricks
skull
the
kings
jester
this
een
that
let
me
see
alas
poor
yorick
i
knew
him
horatio
a
fellow
of
infinite
jest
of
most
excellent
fancy
he
hath
borne
me
on
his
back
a
thousand
times
and
now
how
abhorred
in
my
imagination
it
is
my
gorge
rises
at
it
here
hung
those
lips
that
i
have
kissed
i
know
not
how
oft
where
be
your
gibes
now
your
gambols
your
songs
your
flashes
of
merriment
that
were
wont
to
set
the
table
on
a
roar
not
one
now
to
mock
your
own
grinning
quite
chapfallen
now
get
you
to
my
ladys
chamber
and
tell
her
let
her
paint
an
inch
thick
to
this
favour
she
must
come
make
her
laugh
at
that
prithee
horatio
tell
me
one
thing
whats
that
my
lord
dost
thou
think
alexander
looked
o
this
fashion
i
the
earth
een
so
and
smelt
so
pah
een
so
my
lord
to
what
base
uses
we
may
return
horatio
why
may
not
imagination
trace
the
noble
dust
of
alexander
till
he
find
it
stopping
a
bunghole
twere
to
consider
too
curiously
to
consider
so
no
faith
not
a
jot
but
to
follow
him
thither
with
modesty
enough
and
likelihood
to
lead
it
as
thus
alexander
died
alexander
was
buried
alexander
returneth
into
dust
the
dust
is
earth
of
earth
we
make
loam
and
why
of
that
loam
whereto
he
was
converted
might
they
not
stop
a
beerbarrel
imperious
c
sar
dead
and
turnd
to
clay
might
stop
a
hole
to
keep
the
wind
away
o
that
that
earth
which
kept
the
world
in

for
this
sir
now
shall
you
see
the
other
you
do
remember
all
the
circumstance
remember
it
my
lord
sir
in
my
heart
there
was
a
kind
of
fighting
that
would
not
let
me
sleep
methought
i
lay
worse
than
the
mutines
in
the
bilboes
rashly
and
praisd
be
rashness
for
it
let
us
know
our
indiscretion
sometimes
serves
us
well
when
our
deep
plots
do
pall
and
that
should
teach
us
theres
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
roughhew
them
how
we
will
that
is
most
certain
up
from
my
cabin
my
seagown
scarfd
about
me
in
the
dark
gropd
i
to
find
out
them
had
my
desire
fingerd
their
packet
and
in
fine
withdrew
to
mine
own
room
again
making
so
bold
my
fears
forgetting
manners
to
unseal
their
grand
commission
where
i
found
horatio
o
royal
knavery
an
exact
command
larded
with
many
several
sorts
of
reasons
importing
denmarks
health
and
englands
too
with
ho
such
bugs
and
goblins
in
my
life
that
on
the
supervise
no
leisure
bated
no
not
to
stay
the
grinding
of
the
axe
my
head
should
be
struck
off
is
t
possible
heres
the
commission
read
it
at
more
leisure
but
wilt
thou
hear
me
how
i
did
proceed
i
beseech
you
being
thus
benetted
round
with
villanies
ere
i
could
make
a
prologue
to
my
brains
they
had
begun
the
play
i
sat
me
down
devisd
a
new
commission
wrote
it
fair
i
once
did
hold
it
as
our
statists
do
a
baseness
to
write
fair
and
labourd
much
how
to
forget
that
learning
but
sir
now
it
did
me
yeomans
service
wilt
thou
know
the
effect
of
what
i
wrote
ay
good
my
lord
an
earnest
conjuration
from
the
king
as
england
was
his
faithful
tributary
as
love
between
them
like
the
palm
should
flourish
as
peace
should
still
her
wheaten
garland
wear
and
stand
a
comma
tween
their
amities
and
many
suchlike
ases
of
great
charge
that
on
the
view
and
knowing
of
these
contents
without
debatement
further
more
or
less
he
should
the
bearers
put
to
sudden
death
not
shrivingtime
allowd
how
was
this
seald
why
even
in
that
was
heaven
ordinant
i
had
my
fathers
signet
in
my
purse
which
was
the
model
of
that
danish
seal
folded
the
writ
up
in
form
of
the
other
subscribd
it
gavet
th
impression
placd
it
safely
the
changeling
never
known
now
the
next
day
was
our
seafight
and
what
to
this
was
sequent
thou
knowst
already
so
guildenstern
and
rosencrantz
go
to
t
why
man
they
did
make
love
to
this
employment
they
are
not
near
my
conscience
their
defeat
does
by
their
own
insinuation
grow
tis
dangerous
when
the
baser
nature
comes
between
the
pass
and
fellincensed
points
of
mighty
opposites
why
what
a
king
is
this
does
it
not
thinkst
thee
stand
me
now
upon
he
that
hath
killd
my
king
and
whord
my
mother
poppd
in
between
the
election
and
my
hopes
thrown
out
his
angle
for
my
proper
life
and
with
such
cozenage
is
t
not
perfect
conscience
to
quit
him
with
this
arm
and
is
t
not
to
be
damnd
to
let
this
canker
of
our
nature
come
in
further
evil
it
must
be
shortly
known
to
him
from
england
what
is
the
issue
of
the
business
there
it
will
be
short
the
interim
is
mine
and
a
mans
lifes
no
more
than
to
say
one
but
i
am
very
sorry
good
horatio
that
to
laertes
i
forgot
myself
for
by
the
image
of
my
cause
i
see
the
portraiture
of
his
ill
count
his
favours
but
sure
the
bravery
of
his
grief
did
put
me
into
a
towering
passion
peace
who
comes
here
your
lordship
is
right
welcome
back
to
denmark
i
humbly
thank
you
sir
dost
know
this
waterfly
no
my
good
lord
thy
state
is
the
more
gracious
for
tis
a
vice
to
know
him
he
hath
much
land
and
fertile
let
a
beast
be
lord
of
beasts
and
his
crib
shall
stand
at
the
kings
mess
tis
a
chough
but
as
i
say
spacious
in
the
possession
of
dirt
sweet
lord
if
your
lordship
were
at
leisure
i
should
impart
a
thing
to
you
from
his
majesty
i
will
receive
it
sir
with
all
diligence
of
spirit
your
bonnet
to
his
right
use
tis
for
the
head
i
thank
your
lordship
tis
very
hot
no
believe
me
tis
very
cold
the
wind
is
northerly
it
is
indifferent
cold
my
lord
indeed
but
yet
methinks
it
is
very
sultry
and
hot
for
my
complexion
exceedingly
my
lord
it
is
very
sultry
as
twere
i
cannot
tell
how
but
my
lord
his
majesty
bade
me
signify
to
you
that
he
has
laid
a
great
wager
on
your
head
sir
this
is
the
matter
i
beseech
you
remember
nay
good
my
lord
for
mine
ease
in
good
faith
sir
here
is
newly
come
to
court
laertes
believe
me
an
absolute
gentleman
full
of
most
excellent
differences
of
very
soft
society
and
great
showing
indeed
to
speak
feelingly
of
him
he
is
the
card
or
calendar
of
gentry
for
you
shall
find
in
him
the
continent
of
what
part
a
gentleman
would
see
sir
his
definement
suffers
no
perdition
in
you
though
i
know
to
divide
him
inventorially
would
dizzy
the
arithmetic
of
memory
and
yet
but
yaw
neither
in
respect
of
his
quick
sail
but
in
the
verity
of
extolment
i
take
him
to
be
a
soul
of
great
article
and
his
infusion
of
such
dearth
and
rareness
as
to
make
true
diction
of
him
his
semblable
is
his
mirror
and
who
else
would
trace
him
his
umbrage
nothing
more
your
lordship
speaks
most
infallibly
of
him
the
concernancy
sir
why
do
we
wrap
the
gentleman
in
our
more
rawer
breath
sir
is
t
not
possible
to
understand
in
another
tongue
you
will
do
t
sir
really
what
imports
the
nomination
of
this
gentleman
of
laertes
his
purse
is
empty
already
all
s
golden
words
are
spent
of
him
sir
i
know
you
are
not
ignorant
i
would
you
did
sir
in
faith
if
you
did
it
would
not
much
approve
me
well
sir
you
are
not
ignorant
of
what
excellence
laertes
is
i
dare
not
confess
that
lest
i
should
compare
with
him
in
excellence
but
to
know
a
man
well
were
to
know
himself
i
mean
sir
for
his
weapon
but
in
the
imputation
laid
on
him
by
them
in
his
meed
hes
unfellowed
whats
his
weapon
rapier
and
dagger
thats
two
of
his
weapons
but
well
the
king
sir
hath
wagered
with
him
six
barbary
horses
against
the
which
he
has
imponed
as
i
take
it
six
french
rapiers
and
poniards
with
their
assigns
as
girdle
hangers
and
so
three
of
the
carriages
in
faith
are
very
dear
to
fancy
very
responsive
to
the
hilts
most
delicate
carriages
and
of
very
liberal
conceit
what
call
you
the
carriages
i
knew
you
must
be
edified
by
the
margent
ere
you
had
done
the
carriages
sir
are
the
hangers
the
phrase
would
be
more
german
to
the
matter
if
we
could
carry
cannon
by
our
sides
i
would
it
might
be
hangers
till
then
but
on
six
barbary
horses
against
six
french
swords
their
assigns
and
three
liberalconceited
carriages
thats
the
french
bet
against
the
danish
why
is
this
imponed
as
you
call
it
the
king
sir
hath
laid
that
in
a
dozen
passes
between
yourself
and
him
he
shall
not
exceed
you
three
hits
he
hath
laid
on
twelve
for
nine
and
it
would
come
to
immediate
trial
if
your
lordship
would
vouchsafe
the
answer
how
if
i
answer
no
i
mean
my
lord
the
opposition
of
your
person
in
trial
sir
i
will
walk
here
in
the
hall
if
it
please
his
majesty
tis
the
breathing
time
of
day
with
me
let
the
foils
be
brought
the
gentleman
willing
and
the
king
hold
his
purpose
i
will
win
for
him
an
i
can
if
not
i
will
gain
nothing
but
my
shame
and
the
odd
hits
shall
i
redeliver
you
so
to
this
effect
sir
after
what
flourish
your
nature
will
i
commend
my
duty
to
your
lordship
yours
yours
he
does
well
to
commend
it
himself
there
are
no
tongues
else
for
s
turn
this
lapwing
runs
away
with
the
shell
on
his
head
he
did
comply
with
his
dug
before
he
sucked
it
thus
has
he
and
many
more
of
the
same
bevy
that
i
know
the
drossy
age
dotes
on
only
got
the
tune
of
the
time
and
outward
habit
of
encounter
a
kind
of
yesty
collection
which
carries
them
through
and
through
the
most
fond
and
winnowed
opinions
and
do
but
blow
them
to
their
trial
the
bubbles
are
out
my
lord
his
majesty
commended
him
to
you
by
young
osric
who
brings
back
to
him
that
you
attend
him
in
the
hall
he
sends
to
know
if
your
pleasure
hold
to
play
with
laertes
or
that
you
will
take
longer
time
i
am
constant
to
my
purposes

follow
the
kings
pleasure
if
his
fitness
speaks
mine
is
ready
now
or
whensoever
provided

so
able
as
now
the
king
and
queen
and
all
are
coming
down
in
happy
time
the
queen
desires
you
to
use
some
gentle
entertainment
to
laertes
before
you
fall
to
play
she
well
instructs
me
you
will
lose
this
wager
my
lord
i
do
not
think
so
since
he
went
into
france
i
have
been
in
continual
practice
i
shall
win
at
the
odds
but
thou
wouldst
not
think
how
ill
all
s
here
about
my
heart
but
it
is
no
matter
nay
good
my
lord

is
but
foolery
but
it
is
such
a
kind
of
gaingiving
as
would
perhaps
trouble
a
woman

your
mind
dislike
any
thing

it
i
will
forestal
their
repair
hither
and
say
you
are
not

special
providence

the
fall
of
a
sparrow

now

not
to
come
if
it
be
not
to
come
it
will
be
now
if
it
be
not
now
yet
it
will
come
the
readiness

aught
of
what
he

arrow
oer

house

he
has
my
dying
voice
so
tell
him
with
the
occurrents
more
and
less
which
have
solicited
the
rest
is
silence
now
cracks
a
noble
heart
goodnight
sweet
prince
and
flights
of
angels
sing
thee
to
thy
rest
why
does
the
drum
come
hither
where
is
this
sight
what
is
it
ye
would
see
if
aught
of
woe
or
wonder
cease
your
search
this
quarry
cries
on
havoc
o
proud
death
what
feast
is
toward
in
thine
eternal
cell
that
thou
so
many
princes
at
a
shot
so
bloodily
hast
struck
the
sight
is
dismal
and
our
affairs
from
england
come
too
late
the
ears
are
senseless
that
should
give
us
hearing
to
tell
him
his
commandment
is
fulfilld
that
rosencrantz
and
guildenstern
are
dead
where
should
we
have
our
thanks
not
from
his
mouth
had
it
the
ability
of
life
to
thank
you
he
never
gave
commandment
for
their
death
but
since
so
jump
upon
this
bloody
question
you
from
the
polack
wars
and
you
from
england
are
here
arrivd
give
order
that
these
bodies
high
on
a
stage
be
placed
to
the
view
and
let
me
speak
to
the
yet
unknowing
world
how
these
things
came
about
so
shall
you
hear
of
carnal
bloody
and
unnatural
acts
of
accidental
judgments
casual
slaughters
of
deaths
put
on
by
cunning
and
forcd
cause
and
in
this
upshot
purposes
mistook
falln
on
the
inventors
heads
all
this
can
i
truly
deliver
let
us
haste
to
hear
it
and
call
the
noblest
to
the
audience
for
me
with
sorrow
i
embrace
my
fortune
i
have
some
rights
of
memory
in
this
kingdom
which
now
to
claim
my
vantage
doth
invite
me
of
that
i
shall
have
also
cause
to
speak
and
from
his
mouth
whose
voice
will
draw
on
more
but
let
this
same
be
presently
performd
even
while
mens
minds
are
wild
lest
more
mischance
on
plots
and
errors
happen
let
four
captains
bear
hamlet
like
a
soldier
to
the
stage
for
he
was
likely
had
he
been
put
on
to
have
provd
most
royally
and
for
his
passage
the
soldiers
music
and
the
rites
of
war
speak
loudly
for
him
take
up
the
bodies
such
a
sight
as
this
becomes
the
field
but
here
shows
much
amiss
go
bid
the
soldiers
shoot
julius
caesar
hence
home
you
idle
creatures
get
you
home
is
this
a
holiday
what
know
you
not
being
mechanical
you
ought
not
walk
upon
a
labouring
day
without
the
sign
of
your
profession
speak
what
trade
art
thou
why
sir
a
carpenter
where
is
thy
leather
apron
and
thy
rule
what
dost
thou
with
thy
best
apparel
on
you
sir
what
trade
are
you
truly
sir
in
respect
of
a
fine
workman
i
am
but
as
you
would
say
a
cobbler
but
what
trade
art
thou
answer
me
directly
a
trade
sir
that
i
hope
i
may
use
with
a
safe
conscience
which
is
indeed
sir
a
mender
of
bad
soles
what
trade
thou
knave
thou
naughty
knave
what
trade
nay
i
beseech
you
sir
be
not
out
with
me
yet
if
you
be
out
sir
i
can
mend
you
what
meanest
thou
by
that
mend
me
thou
saucy
fellow
why
sir
cobble
you
thou
art
a
cobbler
art
thou
truly
sir
all
that
i
live
by
is
with
the
awl
i
meddle
with
no
tradesmans
matters
nor
womens
matters
but
with
awl
i
am
indeed
sir
a
surgeon
to
old
shoes
when
they
are
in
great
danger
i
recover
them
as
proper
men
as
ever
trod
upon
neats
leather
have
gone
upon
my
handiwork
but
wherefore
art
not
in
thy
shop
today
why
dost
thou
lead
these
men
about
the
streets
truly
sir
to
wear
out
their
shoes
to
get
myself
into
more
work
but
indeed
sir
we
make
holiday
to
see
c
sar
and
to
rejoice
in
his
triumph
wherefore
rejoice
what
conquest
brings
he
home
what
tributaries
follow
him
to
rome
to
grace
in
captive
bonds
his
chariot
wheels
you
blocks
you
stones
you
worse
than
senseless
things
o
you
hard
hearts
you
cruel
men
of
rome
knew
you
not
pompey
many
a
time
and
oft
have
you
climbd
up
to
walls
and
battlements
to
towers
and
windows
yea
to
chimneytops
your
infants
in
your
arms
and
there
have
sat
the
livelong
day
with
patient
expectation
to
see
great
pompey
pass
the
streets
of
rome
and
when
you
saw
his
chariot
but
appear
have
you
not
made
a
universal
shout
that
tiber
trembled
underneath
her
banks
to
hear
the
replication
of
your
sounds
made
in
her
concave
shores
and
do
you
now
put
on
your
best
attire
and
do
you
now
cull
out
a
holiday
and
do
you
now
strew
flowers
in
his
way
that
comes
in
triumph
over
pompeys
blood
be
gone
run
to
your
houses
fall
upon
your
knees
pray
to
the
gods
to
intermit
the
plague
that
needs
must
light
on
this
ingratitude
go
go
good
countrymen
and
for
this
fault
assemble
all
the
poor
men
of
your
sort
draw
them
to
tiber
banks
and
weep
your
tears
into
the
channel
till
the
lowest
stream
do
kiss
the
most
exalted
shores
of
all
see
wher
their
basest
metal
be
not
movd
they
vanish
tonguetied
in
their
guiltiness
go
you
down
that
way
towards
the
capitol
this
way
will
i
disrobe
the
images
if
you
do
find
them
deckd
with
ceremonies

we
do
so
you
know
it
is
the
feast
of
lupercal
it
is
no
matter

be
hung
with

sars
trophies

drive
away

vulgar
from

where
you
perceive

growing
feathers
pluckd
from
c
sars

make
him
fly
an
ordinary
pitch
who

to
touch
calphurnia

barren

their
sterile
curse

again
who
is

in
the
press
that
calls
on

a
tongue
shriller
than
all
the
music

c
sar

c
sar
is
turnd
to
hear
beware
the
ides
of

what
man

a
soothsayer
bids
you

ides
of

set

what
sayst

to
me
now
speak

again
beware
the
ides
of

he
is
a
dreamer
let
us
leave
him

will
you
go
see
the
order
of
the
course
not
i
i
pray
you
do
i
am
not
gamesome
i
do
lack
some
part
of
that
quick
spirit
that
is
in
antony
let
me
not
hinder
cassius
your
desires
ill
leave
you
brutus
i
do
observe
you
now
of
late
i
have
not
from
your
eyes
that
gentleness
and
show
of
love
as
i
was
wont
to
have
you
bear
too
stubborn
and
too
strange
a
hand
over
your
friend
that
loves
you
cassius
be
not
deceivd
if
i
have
veild
my
look
i
turn
the
trouble
of
my
countenance
merely
upon
myself
vexed
i
am
of
late
with
passions
of
some
difference
conceptions
only
proper
to
myself
which
give
some
soil
perhaps
to
my
behaviours
but
let
not
therefore
my
good
friends
be
grievd
among
which
number
cassius
be
you
one
nor
construe
any
further
my
neglect
than
that
poor
brutus
with
himself
at
war
forgets
the
shows
of
love
to
other
men
then
brutus
i
have
much
mistook
your
passion
by
means
whereof
this
breast
of
mine
hath
buried
thoughts
of
great
value
worthy
cogitations
tell
me
good
brutus
can
you
see
your
face
no
cassius
for
the
eye
sees
not
itself
but
by
reflection
by
some
other
things
tis
just
and
it
is
very
much
lamented
brutus
that
you
have
no
such
mirrors
as
will
turn
your
hidden
worthiness
into
your
eye
that
you
might
see
your
shadow
i
have
heard
where
many
of
the
best
respect
in
rome
except
immortal
c
sar
speaking
of
brutus
and
groaning
underneath
this
ages
yoke
have
wishd
that
noble
brutus
had
his
eyes
into
what
dangers
would
you
lead
me
cassius
that
you
would
have
me
seek
into
myself
for
that
which
is
not
in
me
therefore
good
brutus
be
prepard
to
hear
and
since
you
know
you
cannot
see
yourself
so
well
as
by
reflection
i
your
glass
will
modestly
discover
to
yourself
that
of
yourself
which
you
yet
know
not
of
and
be
not
jealous
on
me
gentle
brutus
were
i
a
common
laugher
or
did
use
to
stale
with
ordinary
oaths
my
love
to
every
new
protester
if
you
know
that
i
do
fawn
on
men
and
hug
them
hard
and
after
scandal
them
or
if
you
know
that
i
profess
myself
in
banqueting
to
all
the
rout
then
hold
me
dangerous
what
means
this
shouting
i
do
fear
the
people
choose
c
sar
for
their
king
ay
do
you
fear
it
then
must
i
think
you
would
not
have
it
so
i
would
not
cassius
yet
i
love
him
well
but
wherefore
do
you
hold
me
here
so
long
what
is
it
that
you
would
impart
to
me
if
it
be
aught
toward
the
general
good
set
honour
in
one
eye
and
death
i
the
other
and
i
will
look
on
both
indifferently
for
let
the
gods
so
speed
me
as
i
love
the
name
of
honour
more
than
i
fear
death
i
know
that
virtue
to
be
in
you
brutus
as
well
as
i
do
know
your
outward
favour
well
honour
is
the
subject
of
my
story
i
cannot
tell
what
you
and
other
men
think
of
this
life
but
for
my
single
self
i
had
as
lief
not
be
as
live
to
be
in
awe
of
such
a
thing
as
i
myself
i
was
born
free
as
c
sar
so
were
you
we
both
have
fed
as
well
and
we
can
both
endure
the
winters
cold
as
well
as
he
for
once
upon
a
raw
and
gusty
day
the
troubled
tiber
chafing
with
her
shores
c
sar
said
to
me
darst
thou
cassius
now
leap
in
with
me
into
this
angry
flood
and
swim
to
yonder
point
upon
the
word
accoutred
as
i
was
i
plunged
in
and
bade
him
follow
so
indeed
he
did
the
torrent
roard
and
we
did
buffet
it
with
lusty
sinews
throwing
it
aside
and
stemming
it
with
hearts
of
controversy
but
ere
we
could
arrive
the
point
proposd
c
sar
cried
help
me
cassius
or
i
sink
i
as
neas
our
great
ancestor
did
from
the
flames
of
troy
upon
his
shoulder
the
old
anchises
bear
so
from
the
waves
of
tiber
did
i
the
tired
c
sar
and
this
man
is
now
become
a
god
and
cassius
is
a
wretched
creature
and
must
bend
his
body
if
c
sar
carelessly
but
nod
on
him
he
had
a
fever
when
he
was
in
spain
and
when
the
fit
was
on
him
i
did
mark
how
he
did
shake
tis
true
this
god
did
shake
his
coward
lips
did
from
their
colour
fly
and
that
same
eye
whose
bend
doth
awe
the
world
did
lose
his
lustre
i
did
hear
him
groan
ay
and
that
tongue
of
his
that
bade
the
romans
mark
him
and
write
his
speeches
in
their
books
alas
it
cried
give
me
some
drink
titinius
as
a
sick
girl
ye
gods
it
doth
amaze
me
a
man
of
such
a
feeble
temper
should
so
get
the
start
of
the
majestic
world
and
bear
the
palm
alone
another
general
shout
i
do
believe
that
these
applauses
are
for
some
new
honours
that
are
heaped
on
c
sar
why
man
he
doth
bestride
the
narrow
world
like
a
colossus
and
we
petty
men
walk
under
his
huge
legs
and
peep
about
to
find
ourselves
dishonourable
graves
men
at
some
time
are
masters
of
their
fates
the
fault
dear
brutus
is
not
in
our
stars
but
in
ourselves
that
we
are
underlings
brutus
and
c
sar
what
should
be
in
that
c
sar
why
should
that
name
be
sounded
more
than
yours
write
them
together
yours
is
as
fair
a
name
sound
them
it
doth
become
the
mouth
as
well
weigh
them
it
is
as
heavy
conjure
with
em
brutus
will
start
a
spirit
as
soon
as
c
sar
now
in
the
names
of
all
the
gods
at
once
upon
what
meat
doth
this
our
c
sar
feed
that
he
is
grown
so
great
age
thou
art
shamd
rome
thou
hast
lost
the
breed
of
noble
bloods
when
went
there
by
an
age
since
the
great
flood
but
it
was
famd
with
more
than
with
one
man
when
could
they
say
till
now
that
talkd
of
rome
that
her
wide
walls
encompassd
but
one
man
now
is
it
rome
indeed
and
room
enough
when
there
is
in
it
but
one
only
man
o
you
and
i
have
heard
our
fathers
say
there
was
a
brutus
once
that
would
have
brookd
th
eternal
devil
to
keep
his
state
in
rome
as
easily
as
a
king
that
you
do
love
me
i
am
nothing
jealous
what
you
would
work
me
to
i
have
some
aim
how
i
have
thought
of
this
and
of
these
times
i
shall
recount
hereafter
for
this
present
i
would
not
so
with
love
i
might
entreat
you
be
any
further
movd
what
you
have
said
i
will
consider
what
you
have
to
say
i
will
with
patience
hear
and
find
a
time
both
meet
to
hear
and
answer
such
high
things
till
then
my
noble
friend
chew
upon
this
brutus
had
rather
be
a
villager
than
to
repute
himself
a
son
of
rome
under
these
hard
conditions
as
this
time
is
like
to
lay
upon
us
i
am
glad
that
my
weak
words
have
struck
but
thus
much
show
of
fire
from
brutus
the
games
are
done
and
c
sar
is
returning
as
they
pass
by
pluck
casca
by
the
sleeve
and
he
will
after
his
sour
fashion
tell
you
what
hath
proceeded
worthy
note
today
i
will
do
so
but
look
you
cassius
the
angry
spot
doth
glow
on
c
sars
brow
and
all
the
rest
look
like
a
chidden
train
calphurnias
cheek
is
pale
and
cicero
looks
with
such
ferret
and
such
fiery
eyes
as
we
have
seen
him
in
the
capitol
being
crossd
in
conference
by
some
senators
casca
will
tell
us
what
the
matter
is
antonius
c
sar
let
me
have
men
about
me
that
are
fat
sleekheaded
men
and
such
as
sleep
o
nights
yond
cassius
has
a
lean
and
hungry
look
he
thinks
too
much
such
men
are
dangerous
fear
him
not
c
sar
hes
not
dangerous
he
is
a
noble
roman
and
well
given
would
he
were
fatter
but
i
fear
him
not
yet
if
my
name
were
liable
to
fear
i
do
not
know
the
man
i
should
avoid
so
soon
as
that
spare
cassius
he
reads
much
he
is
a
great
observer
and
he
looks
quite
through
the
deeds
of
men
he
loves
no
plays
as
thou
dost
antony
he
hears
no
music
seldom
he
smiles
and
smiles
in
such
a
sort
as
if
he
mockd
himself
and
scornd
his
spirit
that
could
be
movd
to
smile
at
any
thing
such
men
as
he
be
never
at
hearts
ease
whiles
they
behold
a
greater
than
themselves
and
therefore
are
they
very
dangerous
i
rather
tell
thee
what
is
to
be
feard
than
what
i
fear
for
always
i
am
c
sar
come
on
my
right
hand
for
this
ear
is
deaf
and
tell
me
truly
what
thou
thinkst
of
him
you
pulld
me
by
the
cloak
would
you
speak
with
me
ay
casca
tell
us
what
hath
chancd
today
that
c
sar
looks
so
sad
why
you
were
with
him
were
you
not
i
should
not
then
ask
casca
what
had
chancd
why
there
was
a
crown
offered
him
and
being
offered
him
he
put
it
by
with
the
back
of
his
hand
thus
and
then
the
people
fell
ashouting
what
was
the
second
noise
for
why
for
that
too
they
shouted
thrice
what
was
the
last
cry
for
why
for
that
too
was
the
crown
offered
him
thrice
ay
marry
was
t
and
he
put
it
by
thrice
everytime
gentler
than
other
and
at
every
puttingby
mine
honest
neighbours
shouted
who
offered
him
the
crown
why
antony
tell
us
the
manner
of
it
gentle
casca
i
can
as
well
be
hanged
as
tell
the
manner
of
it
it
was
mere
foolery
i
did
not
mark
it
i
saw
mark
antony
offer
him
a
crown
yet
twas
not
a
crown
neither
twas
one
of
these
coronets
and
as
i
told
you
he
put
it
by
once
but
for
all
that
to
my
thinking
he
would
fain
have
had
it
then
he
offered
it
to
him
again
then
he
put
it
by
again
but
to
my
thinking
he
was
very
loath
to
lay
his
fingers
off
it
and
then
he
offered
it
the
third
time
he
put
it
the
third
time
by
and
still
as
he
refused
it
the
rabblement
shouted
and
clapped
their
chopped
hands
and
threw
up
their
sweaty
nightcaps
and
uttered
such
a
deal
of
stinking
breath
because
c
sar
refused
the
crown
that
it
had
almost
choked
c
sar
for
he
swounded
and
fell
down
at
it
and
for
mine
own
part
i
durst
not
laugh
for
fear
of
opening
my
lips
and
receiving
the
bad
air
but
soft
i
pray
you
what
did
c
sar
swound
he
fell
down
in
the
marketplace
and
foamed
at
mouth
and
was
speechless
tis
very
like
he
hath
the
fallingsickness
no
c
sar
hath
it
not
but
you
and
i
and
honest
casca
we
have
the
fallingsickness
i
know
not
what
you
mean
by
that
but
i
am
sure
c
sar
fell
down
if
the
tagrag
people
did
not
clap
him
and
hiss
him
according
as
he
pleased
and
displeased
them
as
they
use
to
do
the
players
in
the
theatre
i
am
no
true
man
what
said
he
when
he
came
unto
himself
marry
before
he
fell
down
when
he
perceivd
the
common
herd
was
glad
he
refused
the
crown
he
plucked
me
ope
his
doublet
and
offered
them
his
throat
to
cut
an
i
had
been
a
man
of
any
occupation
if
i
would
not
have
taken
him
at
a
word
i
would
i
might
go
to
hell
among
the
rogues
and
so
he
fell
when
he
came
to
himself
again
he
said
if
he
had
done
or
said
any
thing
amiss
he
desired
their
worships
to
think
it
was
his
infirmity
three
or
four
wenches
where
i
stood
cried
alas
good
soul
and
forgave
him
with
all
their
hearts
but
theres
no
head
to
be
taken
of
them
if
c
sar
had
stabbed
their
mothers
they
would
have
done
no
less
and
after
that
he
came
thus
sad
away
ay
did
cicero
say
any
thing
ay
he
spoke
greek
to
what
effect
nay
an
i
tell
you
that
ill
neer
look
you
i
the
face
again
but
those
that
understood
him
smiled
at
one
another
and
shook
their
heads
but
for
mine
own
part
it
was
greek
to
me
i
could
tell
you
more
news
too
marullus
and
flavius
for
pulling
scarfs
off
c
sars
images
are
put
to
silence
fare
you
well
there
was
more
foolery
yet
if
i
could
remember
it
will
you
sup
with
me
tonight
casca
no
i
am
promised
forth
will
you
dine
with
me
tomorrow
ay
if
i
be
alive
and
your
mind
hold
and
your
dinner
worth
the
eating
good
i
will
expect
you
do
so
farewell
both
what
a
blunt
fellow
is
this
grown
to
be
he
was
quick
mettle
when
he
went
to
school
so
is
he
now
in
execution
of
any
bold
or
noble
enterprise
however
he
puts
on
this
tardy
form
this
rudeness
is
a
sauce
to
his
good
wit
which
gives
men
stomach
to
digest
his
words
with
better
appetite
and
so
it
is
for
this
time
i
will
leave
you
tomorrow
if
you
please
to
speak
with
me
i
will
come
home
to
you
or
if
you
will
come
home
to
me
and
i
will
wait
for
you
i
will
do
so
till
then
think
of
the
world
well
brutus
thou
art
noble
yet
i
see
thy
honourable
metal
may
be
wrought
from
that
it
is
disposd
therefore
tis
meet
that
noble
minds
keep
ever
with
their
likes
for
who
so
firm
that
cannot
be
seducd
c
sar
doth
bear
me
hard
but
he
loves
brutus
if
i
were
brutus
now
and
he
were
cassius
he
should
not
humour
me
i
will
this
night
in
several
hands
in
at
his
windows
throw
as
if
they
came
from
several
citizens
writings
all
tending
to
the
great
opinion
that
rome
holds
of
his
name
wherein
obscurely
c
sars
ambition
shall
be
glanced
at
and
after
this
let
c
sar
seat
him
sure
for
we
will
shake
him
or
worse
days
endure
good
even
casca
brought
you
c
sar
home
why
are
you
breathless
and
why
stare
you
so
are
not
you
movd
when
all
the
sway
of
earth
shakes
like
a
thing
unfirm
o
cicero
i
have
seen
tempests
when
the
scolding
winds
have
rivd
the
knotty
oaks
and
i
have
seen
the
ambitious
ocean
swell
and
rage
and
foam
to
be
exalted
with
the
threatning
clouds
but
never
till
tonight
never
till
now
did
i
go
through
a
tempest
dropping
fire
either
there
is
a
civil
strife
in
heaven
or
else
the
world
too
saucy
with
the
gods
incenses
them
to
send
destruction
why
saw
you
any
thing
more
wonderful
a
common
slave
you
know
him
well
by
sight
held
up
his
left
hand
which
did
flame
and
burn
like
twenty
torches
joind
and
yet
his
hand
not
sensible
of
fire
remaind
unscorchd
besides
i
have
not
since
put
up
my
sword
against
the
capitol
i
met
a
hon
who
glard
upon
me
and
went
surly
by
without
annoying
me
and
there
were
drawn
upon
a
heap
a
hundred
ghastly
women
transformed
with
their
fear
who
swore
they
saw
men
all
in
fire
walk
up
and
down
the
streets
and
yesterday
the
bird
of
night
did
sit
even
at
noonday
upon
the
marketplace
hooting
and
shrieking
when
these
prodigies
do
so
conjointly
meet
let
not
men
say
these
are
their
reasons
they
are
natural
for
i
believe
they
are
portentous
things
unto
the
climate
that
they
point
upon
indeed
it
is
a
strangedisposed
time
but
men
may
construe
things
after
their
fashion
clean
from
the
purpose
of
the
things
themselves
comes
c
sar
to
the
capitol
tomorrow
he
doth
for
he
did
bid
antonius
send
word
to
you
he
would
be
there
tomorrow
goodnight
then
casca
this
disturbed
sky
is
not
to
walk
in
farewell
cicero
whos
there
a
roman
casca
by
your
voice
your
ear
is
good
cassius
what
night
is
this
a
very
pleasing
night
to
honest
men
who
ever
knew
the
heavens
menace
so
those
that
have
known
the
earth
so
full
of
faults
for
my
part
i
have
walkd
about
the
streets
submitting
me
unto
the
perilous
night
and
thus
unbraced
casca
as
you
see
have
bard
my
bosom
to
the
thunderstone
and
when
the
cross
blue
lightning
seemd
to
open
the
breast
of
heaven
i
did
present
myself
even
in
the
aim
and
very
flash
of
it
but
wherefore
did
you
so
much
tempt
the
heavens
it
is
the
part
of
men
to
fear
and
tremble
when
the
most
mighty
gods
by
tokens
send
such
dreadful
heralds
to
astonish
us
you
are
dull
casca
and
those
sparks
of
life
that
should
be
in
a
roman
you
do
want
or
else
you
use
not
you
look
pale
and
gaze
and
put
on
fear
and
cast
yourself
in
wonder
to
see
the
strange
impatience
of
the
heavens
but
if
you
would
consider
the
true
cause
why
all
these
fires
why
all
these
gliding
ghosts
why
birds
and
beasts
from
quality
and
kind
why
old
men
fools
and
children
calculate
why
all
these
things
change
from
their
ordinance
their
natures
and
preformed
faculties
to
monstrous
quality
why
you
shall
find
that
heaven
hath
infusd
them
with
these
spirits
to
make
them
instruments
of
fear
and
warning
unto
some
monstrous
state
now
could
i
casca
name
to
thee
a
man
most
like
this
dreadful
night
that
thunders
lightens
opens
graves
and
roars
as
doth
the
lion
in
the
capitol
a
man
no
mightier
than
thyself
or
me
in
personal
action
yet
prodigious
grown
and
fearful
as
these
strange
eruptions
are
tis
c
sar
that
you
mean
is
it
not
cassius
let
it
be
who
it
is
for
romans
now
have
thews
and
limbs
like
to
their
ancestors
but
woe
the
while
our
fathers
minds
are
dead
and
we
are
governd
with
our
mothers
spirits
our
yoke
and
sufferance
show
us
womanish
indeed
they
say
the
senators
tomorrow
mean
to
establish
c
sar
as
a
king
and
he
shall
wear
his
crown
by
sea
and
land
in
every
place
save
here
in
italy
i
know
where
i
will
wear
this
dagger
then
cassius
from
bondage
will
deliver
cassius
therein
ye
gods
you
make
the
weak
most
strong
therein
ye
gods
you
tyrants
do
defeat
nor
stony
tower
nor
walls
of
beaten
brass
nor
airless
dungeon
nor
strong
links
of
iron
can
be
retentive
to
the
strength
of
spirit
but
life
being
weary
of
those
worldly
bars
never
lacks
power
to
dismiss
itself
if
i
know
this
know
all
the
world
besides
that
part
of
tyranny
that
i
do
bear
i
can
shake
off
at
pleasure
so
can
i
so
every
bondman
in
his
own
hand
bears
the
power
to
cancel
his
captivity
and
why
should
c
sar
be
a
tyrant
then
poor
man
i
know
he
would
not
be
a
wolf
but
that
he
sees
the
romans
are
but
sheep
he
were
no
lion
were
not
romans
hinds
those
that
with
haste
will
make
a
mighty
fire
begin
it
with
weak
straws
what
trash
is
rome
what
rubbish
and
what
offal
when
it
serves
for
the
base
matter
to
illuminate
so
vile
a
thing
as
c
sar
but
o
grief
where
hast
thou
led
me
i
perhaps
speak
this
before
a
willing
bondman
then
i
know
my
answer
must
be
made
but
i
am
armd
and
dangers
are
to
me
indifferent
you
speak
to
casca
and
to
such
a
man
that
is
no
fleering
telltale
hold
my
hand
be
factious
for
redress
of
all
these
griefs
and
i
will
set
this
foot
of
mine
as
far
as
who
goes
furthest
theres
a
bargain
made
now
know
you
casca
i
have
movd
already
some
certain
of
the
noblestminded
romans
to
undergo
with
me
an
enterprise
of
honourabledangerous
consequence
and
i
do
know
by
this
they
stay
for
me
in
pompeys
porch
for
now
this
fearful
night
there
is
no
stir
or
walking
in
the
streets
and
the
complexion
of
the
element
in
favours
like
the
work
we
have
in
hand
most
bloody
fiery
and
most
terrible
stand
close
awhile
for
here
comes
one
in
haste
tis
cinna
i

parts
of

man
entire
upon
the
next
encounter
yields
him

o
he
sits
high
in
all
the
peoples
hearts
and
that
which
would
appear
offence
in
us
his
countenance
like
richest
alchemy
will
change
to
virtue
and
to
worthiness
him
and
his
worth
and
our
great
need
of
him
you
have
right
well
conceited
let
us
go
for
it
is
after
midnight
and
ere
day
we
will
awake
him
and
be
sure
of
him
what
lucius
ho
i
cannot
by
the
progress
of
the
stars
give
guess
how
near
to
day
lucius
i
say
i
would
it
were
my
fault
to
sleep
so
soundly
when
lucius
when
awake
i
say
what
lucius
calld
you
my
lord
get
me
a
taper
in
my
study
lucius
when
it
is
lighted
come
and
call
me
here
i
will
my
lord
it
must
be
by
his
death
and
for
my
part
i
know
no
personal
cause
to
spurn
at
him
but
for
the
general
he
would
be
crownd
how
that
might
change
his
nature
theres
the
question
it
is
the
bright
day
that
brings
forth
the
adder
and
that
craves
wary
walking
crown
him
that
and
then
i
grant
we
put
a
sting
in
him
that
at
his
will
he
may
do
danger
with
the
abuse
of
greatness
is
when
it
disjoins
remorse
from
power
and
to
speak
truth
of
c
sar
i
have
not
known
when
his
affections
swayd
more
than
his
reason
but
tis
a
common
proof
that
lowliness
is
young
ambitions
ladder
whereto
the
climberupward
turns
his
face
but
when
he
once
attains
the
upmost
round
he
then
unto
the
ladder
turns
his
back
looks
in
the
clouds
scorning
the
base
degrees
by
which
he
did
ascend
so
c
sar
may
then
lest
he
may
prevent
and
since
the
quarrel
will
bear
no
colour
for
the
thing
he
is
fashion
it
thus
that
what
he
is
augmented
would
run
to
these
and
these
extremities
and
therefore
think
him
as
a
serpents
egg
which
hatchd
would
as
his
kind
grow
mischievous
and
kill
him
in
the
shell
the
taper
burneth
in
your
closet
sir
searching
the
window
for
a
flint
i
found
this
paper
thus
seald
up
and
i
am
sure

did
not
lie
there
when
i
went
to
bed

you

at

of

sir
march
is
wasted
fourteen
days
tis
good
go
to
the
gate
somebody
knocks
since
cassius
first
did
whet
me
against
c
sar
i
have
not
slept
between
the
acting
of
a
dreadful
thing
and
the
first
motion
all
the
interim
is
like
a
phantasma
or
a
hideous
dream
the
genius
and
the
mortal
instruments
are
then
in
council
and
the
state
of
man
like
to
a
little
kingdom
suffers
then
the
nature
of
an
insurrection
sir
tis
your
brother
cassius
at
the
door
who
doth
desire
to
see
you
is
he
alone
no
sir
there
are
more
with
him
do
you
know
them
no
sir
their
hats
are
pluckd
about
their
ears
and
half
their
faces
buried
in
their
cloaks
that
by
no
means
i
may
discover
them
by
any
mark
of
favour
let
em
enter
they
are
the
faction
o
conspiracy
shamst
thou
to
show
thy
dangerous
brow
by
night
when
evils
are
most
free
o
then
by
day
where
wilt
thou
find
a
cavern
dark
enough
to
mask
thy
monstrous
visage
seek
none
conspiracy
hide
it
in
smiles
and
affability
for
if
thou
path
thy
native
semblance
on
not
erebus
itself
were
dim
enough
to
hide
thee
from
prevention
i
think
we
are
too
bold
upon
your
rest
good
morrow
brutus
do
we
trouble
you
i
have
been
up
this
hour
awake
all
night
know
i
these
men
that
come
along
with
you
yes
every
man
of
them
and
no
man
here
but
honours
you
and
every
one
doth
wish
you
had
but
that
opinion
of
yourself
which
every
noble
roman
bears
of
you
this
is
trebonius
he
is
welcome
hither
this
decius
brutus
he
is
welcome
too
this
casca
this
cinna
and
this
metellus
cimber
they
are
all
welcome
what
watchful
cares
do
interpose
themselves
betwixt
your
eyes
and
night
shall
i
entreat
a
word
here
lies
the
east
doth
not
the
day
break
here
no
o
pardon
sir
it
doth
and
yon
grey
lines
that
fret
the
clouds
are
messengers
of
day
you
shall
confess
that
you
are
both
deceivd
here
as
i
point
my
sword
the
sun
arises
which
is
a
great
way
growing
on
the
south
weighing
the
youthful
season
of
the
year
some
two
months
hence
up
higher
toward
the
north
he
first
presents
his
fire
and
the
high
east
stands
as
the
capitol
directly
here
give
me
your
hands
all
over
one
by
one
and
let
us
swear
our
resolution
no
not
an
oath
if
not
the
face
of
men
the
sufferance
of
our
souls
the
times
abuse
if
these
be
motives
weak
break
off
betimes
and
every
man
hence
to
his
idle
bed
so
let
highsighted
tyranny
range
on
till
each
mandrop
by
lottery
but
if
these
as
i
am
sure
they
do
bear
fire
enough
to
kindle
cowards
and
to
steel
with
valour
the
melting
spirits
of
women
then
countrymen
what
need
we
any
spur
but
our
own
cause
to
prick
us
to
redress
what
other
bond
than
secret
romans
that
have
spoke
the
word
and
will
not
palter
and
what
other
oath
than
honesty
to
honesty
engagd
that
this
shall
be
or
we
will
fall
for
it
swear
priests
and
cowards
and
men
cautelous
old
feeble
carrions
and
such
suffering
souls
that
welcome
wrongs
unto
bad
causes
swear
such
creatures
as
men
doubt
but
do
not
stain
the
even
virtue
of
our
enterprise
nor
th
insuppressive
mettle
of
our
spirits
to
think
that
or
our
cause
or
our
performance
did
need
an
oath
when
every
drop
of
blood
that
every
roman
bears
and
nobly
bears
is
guilty
of
a
several
bastardy
if
he
do
break
the
smallest
particle
of
any
promise
that
hath
passd
from
him
but
what
of
cicero
shall
we
sound
him
i
think
he
will
stand
very
strong
with
us
let
us
not
leave
him
out
no
by
no
means
o
let
us
have
him
for
his
silver
hairs
will
purchase
us
a
good
opinion
and
buy
mens
voices
to
commend
our
deeds
it
shall
be
said
his
judgment
ruld
our
hands
our
youths
and
wildness
shall
no
whit
appear
but
all
be
buried
in
his
gravity
o
name
him
not
let
us
not
break
with
him
for
he
will
never
follow
any
thing
that
other
men
begin
then
leave
him
out
indeed
he
is
not
fit
shall
no
man
else
be
touchd
but
only
c
sar
decius
well
urgd
i
think
it
is
not
meet
mark
antony
so
well
belovd
of
c
sar
should
outlive
c
sar
we
shall
find
of
him
a
shrewd
contriver
and
you
know
his
means
if
he
improve
them
may
well
stretch
so
far
as
to
annoy
us
all
which
to
prevent
let
antony
and
c
sar
fall
together
our
course
will
seem
too
bloody
caius
cassius
to
cut
the
head
off
and
then
hack
the
limbs
like
wrath
in
death
and
envy
afterwards
for
antony
is
but
a
limb
of
c
sar
let
us
be
sacrificers
but
not
butchers
caius
we
all
stand
up
against
the
spirit
of
c
sar
and
in
the
spirit
of
men
there
is
no
blood
o
then
that
we
could
come
by
c
sars
spirit
and
not
dismember
c
sar
but
alas
c
sar
must
bleed
for
it
and
gentle
friends
lets
kill
him
boldly
but
not
wrathfully
lets
carve
him
as
a
dish
fit
for
the
gods
not
hew
him
as
a
carcass
fit
for
hounds
and
let
our
hearts
as
subtle
masters
do
stir
up
their
servants
to
an
act
of
rage
and
after
seem
to
chide
em
this
shall
make
our
purpose
necessary
and
not
envious
which
so
appearing
to
the
common
eyes
we
shall
be
calld
purgers
not
murderers
and
for
mark
antony
think
not
of
him
for
he
can
do
no
more
than
c
sars
arm
when
c
sars
head
is
off
yet
i
fear
him
for
in
the
engrafted
love
he
bears
to
c
sar
alas
good
cassius
do
not
think
of
him
if
he
love
c
sar
all
that
he
can
do
is
to
himself
take
thought
and
die
for
c
sar
and
that
were
much
he
should
for
he
is
given
to
sports
to
wildness
and
much
company
there
is
no
fear
in
him
let
him
not
die
for
he
will
live
and
laugh
at
this
hereafter
peace
count
the
clock
the
clock
hath
stricken
three
tis
time
to
part
but
it
is
doubtful
yet
whether
c
sar
will
come
forth
today
or
no
for
he
is
superstitious
grown
of
late
quite
from
the
main
opinion
he
held
once
of
fantasy
of
dreams
and
ceremonies
it
may
be
these
apparent
prodigies
the
unaccustomd
terror
of
this
night
and
the
persuasion
of
his
augurers
may
hold
him
from
the
capitol
today
never
fear
that
if
he
be
so
resolvd
i
can
oersway
him
for
he
loves
to
hear
that
unicorns
may
be
betrayd
with
trees
and
bears
with
glasses
elephants
with
holes
lions
with
toils
and
men
with
flatterers
but
when
i
tell
him
he
hates
flatterers
he
says
he
does
being
then
most
flattered
let
me
work
for
i
can
give
his
humour
the
true
bent
and
i
will
bring
him
to
the
capitol
nay
we
will
all
of
us
be
there
to
fetch
him
by
the
eighth
hour
is
that
the
uttermost
be
that
the
uttermost
and
fail
not
then
caius
ligarius
doth
bear
c
sar
hard
who
rated
him
for
speaking
well
of
pompey
i
wonder
none
of
you
have
thought
of
him
now
good
metellus
go
along
by
him
he
loves
me
well
and
i
have
given
him
reasons
send
him
but
hither
and
ill
fashion
him
the
morning
comes
upon
s
well
leave
you
brutus
and
friends
disperse
yourselves
but
all
remember
what
you
have
said
and
show
yourselves
true
romans
good
gentlemen
look
fresh
and
merrily
let
not
our
looks
put
on
our
purposes
but
bear
it
as
our
roman
actors
do
with
untird
spirits
and
formal
constancy
and
so
good
morrow
to
you
every
one
boy
lucius
fast
asleep
it
is
no
matter
enjoy
the
honeyheavy
dew
of
slumber
thou
hast
no
figures
nor
no
fantasies
which
busy
care
draws
in
the
brains
of
men
therefore
thou
sleepst
so
sound
brutus
my
lord
portia
what
mean
you
wherefore
rise
you
now
it
is
not
for
your
health
thus
to
commit
your
weak
condition
to
the
raw
cold
morning
nor
for
yours
neither
youve
ungently
brutus
stole
from
my
bed
and
yesternight
at
supper
you
suddenly
arose
and
walkd
about
musing
and
sighing
with
your
arms
across
and
when
i
askd
you
what
the
matter
was
you
stard
upon
me
with
ungentle
looks
i
urgd
you
further
then
you
scratchd
your
head
and
too
impatiently
stampd
with
your
foot
yet
i
insisted
yet
you
answerd
not
but
with
an
angry
wafture
of
your
hand
gave
sign
for
me
to
leave
you
so
i
did
fearing
to
strengthen
that
impatience
which
seemd
too
much
enkindled
and
withal
hoping
it
was
but
an
effect
of
humour
which
sometime
hath
his
hour
with
every
man
it
will
not
let
you
eat
nor
talk
nor
sleep
and
could
it
work
so
much
upon
your
shape
as
it
hath
much
prevaild
on
your
condition
i
should
not
know
you
brutus
dear
my
lord
make
me
acquainted
with
your
cause
of
grief
i
am
not
well
in
health
and
that
is
all
brutus
is
wise
and
were
he
not
in
health
he
would
embrace
the
means
to
come
by
it
why
so
i
do
good
portia
go
to
bed
is
brutus
sick
and
is
it
physical
to
walk
unbraced
and
suck
up
the
humours
of
the
dank
morning
what
is
brutus
sick
and
will
he
steal
out
of
his
wholesome
bed
to
dare
the
vile
contagion
of
the
night
and
tempt
the
rheumy
and
unpurged
air
to
add
unto
his
sickness
no
my
brutus
you
have
some
sick
offence
within
your
mind
which
by
the
right
and
virtue
of
my
place
i
ought
to
know
of
and
upon
my
knees
i
charm
you
by
my
oncecommended
beauty
by
all
your
vows
of
love
and
that
great
vow
which
did
incorporate
and
make
us
one
that
you
unfold
to
me
your
self
your
half
why
are
you
heavy
and
what
men
tonight
have
had
resort
to
you
for
here
have
been
some
six
or
seven
who
did
hide
their
faces
even
from
darkness
kneel
not
gentle
portia
i
should
not
need
if
you
were
gentle
brutus
within
the
bond
of
marriage
tell
me
brutus
is
it
excepted
i
should
know
no
secrets
that
appertain
to
you
am
i
yourself
but
as
it
were
in
sort
of
limitation
to
keep
with
you
at
meals
comfort
your
bed
and
talk
to
you
sometimes
dwell
i
but
in
the
suburbs
of
your
good
pleasure
if
it
be
no
more
portia
is
brutus
harlot
not
his
wife
you
are
my
true
and
honourable
wife
as
dear
to
me
as
are
the
ruddy
drops
that
visit
my
sad
heart
if
this
were
true
then
should
i
know
this
secret
i
grant
i
am
a
woman
but
withal
a
woman
that
lord
brutus
took
to
wife
i
grant
i
am
a
woman
but
withal
a
woman
wellreputed
catos
daughter
think
you
i
am
no
stronger
than
my
sex
being
so
fatherd
and
so
husbanded
tell
me
your
counsels
i
will
not
disclose
em
i
have
made
strong
proof
of
my
constancy
giving
myself
a
voluntary
wound
here
in
the
thigh
can
i
bear
that
with
patience
and
not
my
husbands
secrets
o
ye
gods
render
me
worthy
of
this
noble
wife
hark
hark
one
knocks
portia
go
in

my

c
sar
think
you
to
walk
forth
you
shall
not
stir
out
of
your
house
today
c
sar
shall
forth
the
things
that
threatend
me
neer
lookd
but
on
my
back
when
they
shall
see
the
face
of
c
sar
they
are
vanished
c
sar
i
never
stood
on
ceremonies
yet
now
they
fright
me
there
is
one
within
besides
the
things
that
we
have
heard
and
seen
recounts
most
horrid
sights
seen
by
the
watch
a
lioness
hath
whelped
in
the
streets
and
graves
have
yawnd
and
yielded
up
their
dead
fierce
fiery
warriors
fought
upon
the
clouds
in
ranks
and
squadrons
and
right
form
of
war
which
drizzled
blood
upon
the
capitol
the
noise
of
battle
hurtled
in
the
air
horses
did
neigh
and
dying
men
did
groan
and
ghosts
did
shriek
and
squeal
about
the
streets
o
c
sar
these
things
are
beyond
all
use
and
i
do
fear
them
what
can
be
avoided
whose
end
is
purposd
by
the
mighty
gods
yet
c
sar
shall
go
forth
for
these
predictions
are
to
the
world
in
general
as
to
c
sar
when
beggars
die
there
are
no
comets
seen
the
heavens
themselves
blaze
forth
the
death
of
princes
cowards
die
many
times
before
their
deaths
the
valiant
never
taste
of
death
but
once
of
all
the
wonders
that
i
yet
have
heard
it
seems
to
me
most
strange
that
men
should
fear
seeing
that
death
a
necessary
end
will
come
when
it
will
come
what
say
the
augurers
they
would
not
have
you
to
stir
forth
today
plucking
the
entrails
of
an
offering
forth
they
could
not
find
a
heart
within
the
beast
the
gods
do
this
in
shame
of
cowardice
c
sar
should
be
a
beast
without
a
heart
if
he
should
stay
at
home
today
for
fear
no
c
sar
shall
not
danger
knows
full
well
that
c
sar
is
more
dangerous
than
he
we
are
two
lions
litterd
in
one
day
and
i
the
elder
and
more
terrible
and
c
sar
shall
go
forth
alas
my
lord
your
wisdom
is
consumd
in
confidence
do
not
go
forth
today
call
it
my
fear
that

house
and
not
your

send
mark
antony
to
the
senatehouse
and
he
shall
say

let
me
upon
my
knee
prevail
in
this
mark
antony

say
i
am
not
well
and
for
thy
humour
i
will
stay
at
home
heres
decius

to
fetch
you
to
the
senatehouse
and

very
happy
time
to
bear
my
greeting
to

false
and
that
i

not

far
to

most
mighty
c
sar
let
me
know
some
cause
lest

so
the
cause
is
in
my
will
i
will
not
come
that
is
enough
to
satisfy
the
senate
but
for
your
private
satisfaction
because
i
love
you
i
will
let
you
know
calphurnia
here
my
wife
stays
me
at
home
she
dreamt
tonight
she
saw
my
statua
which
like
a
fountain
with
a
hundred
spouts
did
run
pure
blood
and
many
lusty
romans
came
smiling
and
did
bathe
their
hands
in
it
and
these
does
she
apply
for
warnings
and
portents
and
evils
imminent
and
on
her
knee
hath
beggd
that
i
will
stay
at
home
today
this
dream
is
all
amiss
interpreted
it
was
a
vision
fair
and
fortunate
your
statue
spouting
blood
in
many
pipes
in
which
so
many
smiling
romans
bathd
signifies
that
from
you
great
rome
shall
suck
reviving
blood
and
that
great
men
shall
press
for
tinctures
stains
relics
and
cognizance
this
by
calphurnias
dream
is
signified
and
this
way
have
you
well
expounded
it
i
have
when
you
have
heard
what
i
can
say
and
know
it
now
the
senate
have
concluded
to
give
this
day
a
crown
to
mighty
c
sar
if
you
shall
send
them
word
you
will
not
come
their
minds
may
change
besides
it
were
a
mock
apt
to
be
renderd
for
some
one
to
say
break
up
the
senate
till
another
time
when
c
sars
wife
shall
meet
with
better
dreams
if
c
sar
hide
himself
shall
they
not
whisper

sar

me
c
sar
for
my
dear
dear

for
my
cause
and
be
silent
that

may
hear
believe

for

me
in

the
better
judge
if
there
be
any
in
this
assembly
any
dear
friend
of
c
sars
to
him
i
say
that
brutus
love
to
c
sar
was
no
less
than
his
if
then
that
friend
demand
why
brutus
rose
against
c
sar
this
is
my
answer
not
that
i
loved
c
sar
less
but
that
i
loved
rome
more
had
you
rather
c
sar
were
living
and
die
all
slaves
than
that
c
sar
were
dead
to
live
all
free
men
as
c
sar
loved
me
i
weep
for
him
as
he
was
fortunate
i
rejoice
at
it
as
he
was
valiant
i
honour
him
but
as
he
was
ambitious
i
slew
him
there
is
tears
for
his
love
joy
for
his
fortune
honour
for
his
valour
and
death
for
his
ambition
who
is
here
so
base
that
would
be
a
bondman
if
any
speak
for
him
have
i
offended
who
is
here
so
rude
that
would
not
be
a
roman
if
any
speak
for
him
have
i
offended
who
is
here
so
vile
that
will
not
love
his
country
if
any
speak
for
him
have
i
offended
i
pause
for
a
reply
none
brutus
none
then
none
have
i
offended
i
have
done
no
more
to
c
sar
than
you
shall
do
to
brutus
the
question
of
his
death
is
enrolled
in
the
capitol
his
glory
not
extenuated
wherein
he
was
worthy
nor
his
offences
enforced
for
which
he
suffered
death
here

no

let

him
friends
romans
countrymen
lend
me
your
ears
i
come
to
bury
c
sar
not
to
praise
him
the
evil
that
men
do
lives
after
them
the
good
is
oft
interred
with
their
bones
so
let
it
be
with
c
sar
the
noble
brutus
hath
told
you
c
sar
was
ambitious
if
it
were
so
it
was
a
grievous
fault
and
grievously
hath
c
sar
answerd
it
here
under
leave
of
brutus
and
the
rest
for
brutus
is
an
honourable
man
so
are
they
all
all
honourable
men
come
i
to
speak
in
c
sars
funeral
he
was
my
friend
faithful
and
just
to
me
but
brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
and
brutus
is
an
honourable
man
he
hath
brought
many
captives
home
to
rome
whose
ransoms
did
the
general
coffers
fill
did
this
in
c
sar
seem
ambitious
when
that
the
poor
have
cried
c
sar
hath
wept
ambition
should
be
made
of
sterner
stuff
yet
brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
and
brutus
is
an
honourable
man
you
all
did
see
that
on
the
lupercal
i
thrice
presented
him
a
kingly
crown
which
he
did
thrice
refuse
was
this
ambition
yet
brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
and
sure
he
is
an
honourable
man
i
speak
not
to
disprove
what
brutus
spoke
but
here
i
am
to
speak
what
i
do
know
you
all
did
love
him
once
not
without
cause
what
cause
withholds
you
then
to
mourn
for
him
o
judgment
thou
art
fled
to
brutish
beasts
and
men
have
lost
their
reason
bear
with
me
my
heart
is
in
the
coffin
there
with
c
sar
and
i
must
pause
till
it
come
back
to
me
methinks
there
is
much
reason
in
his
sayings
if
thou
consider
rightly
of
the
matter
c
sar
has
had
great
wrong
has
he
masters
i
fear
there
will
a
worse
come
in
his
place
markd
ye
his
words
he
would
not
take
the
crown
therefore
tis
certain
he
was
not
ambitious
if
it
be
found
so
some
will
dear
abide
it
poor
soul
his
eyes
are
red
as
fire
with
weeping
theres
not
a
nobler
man
in
rome
than
antony
now
mark
him
he
begins
again
to
speak
but
yesterday
the
word
of
c
sar
might
have
stood
against
the
world
now
lies
he
there
and
none
so
poor
to
do
him
reverence
o
masters
if
i
were
disposd
to
stir
your
hearts
and
minds
to
mutiny
and
rage
i
should
do
brutus
wrong
and
cassius
wrong
who
you
all
know
are
honourable
men
i
will
not
do
them
wrong
i
rather
choose
to
wrong
the
dead
to
wrong
myself
and
you
than
i
will
wrong
such
honourable
men
but
heres
a
parchment
with
the
seal
of
c
sar
i
found
it
in
his
closet
tis
his
will
let
but
the
commons
hear
this
testament
which
pardon
me
i
do
not
mean
to
read
and
they
would
go
and
kiss
dead
c
sars
wounds
and
dip
their
napkins
in
his
sacred
blood
yea
beg
a
hair
of
him
for
memory

as
a
rich
legacy

this
is
a
slight
unmeritable
man
meet
to
be
sent
on
errands
is
it
fit
the
threefold
world
divided
he
should
stand
one
of
the
three
to
share
it
so
you
thought
him
and
took
his
voice
who
should
be
prickd
to
die
in
our
black
sentence
and
proscription
octavius
i
have
seen
more
days
than
you
and
though
we
lay
these
honours
on
this
man
to
ease
ourselves
of
divers
slanderous
loads
he
shall
but
bear
them
as
the
ass
bears
gold
to
groan
and
sweat
under
the
business
either
led
or
driven
as
we
point
the
way
and
having
brought
our
treasure
where
we
will
then
take
we
down
his
load
and
turn
him
off
like
to
the
empty
ass
to
shake
his
ears
and
graze
in
commons
you
may
do
your
will
but
hes
a
tried
and
valiant
soldier
so
is
my
horse
octavius
and
for
that
i
do
appoint
him
store
of
provender
it
is
a
creature
that
i
teach
to
fight
to
wind
to
stop
to
run
directly
on
his
corporal
motion
governd
by
my
spirit
and
in
some
taste
is
lepidus
but
so
he
must
be
taught
and
traind
and
bid
go
forth
a
barrenspirited
fellow
one
that
feeds
on
abject
orts
and
imitations
which
out
of
use
and
stald
by
other
men
begin
his
fashion
do
not
talk
of
him
but
as
a
property
and
now
octavius
listen
great
things
brutus
and
cassius
are
levying
powers
we
must
straight
make
head
therefore
let
our
alliance
be
combind
our
best
friends
made
and
our
best
means
stretchd
out
and
let
us
presently
go
sit
in
council
how
covert
matters
may
be
best
disclosd
and
open
perils
surest
answered
let
us
do
so
for
we
are
at
the
stake
and
bayd
about
with
many
enemies
and
some
that
smile
have
in
their
hearts
i
fear
millions
of
mischiefs
stand
ho
give
the
word
ho
and
stand
what
now
lucilius
is
cassius
near
he
is
at
hand
and
pindarus
is
come
to
do
you
salutation
from
his
master
he
greets
me
well
your
master
pindarus
in
his
own
change
or
by
ill
officers
hath
given
me
some
worthy
cause
to
wish
things
done
undone
but
if
he
be
at
hand
i
shall
be
satisfied
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
my
noble
master
will
appear
such
as
he
is
full
of
regard
and
honour
he
is
not
doubted
a
word
lucilius
how
he
receivd
you
let
me
be
resolvd
with
courtesy
and
with
respect
enough
but
not
with
such
familiar
instances
nor
with
such
free
and
friendly
conference
as
he
hath
usd
of
old
thou
hast
describd
a
hot
friend
cooling
ever
note
lucilius
when
love
begins
to
sicken
and
decay
it
useth
an
enforced
ceremony
there
are
no
tricks
in
plain
and
simple
faith
but
hollow
men
like
horses
hot
at
hand
make
gallant
show
and
promise
of
their
mettle
but
when
they
should
endure
the
bloody
spur
they
fall
their
crests
and
like
deceitful
jades
sink
in
the
trial
comes
his
army
on
they
mean
this
night
in
sardis
to
be
quarterd
the
greater
part
the
horse
in
general
are
come

most
noble
brother

done
me
wrong

if
not
so
how
should
i
wrong
a
brother
brutus
this
sober
form
of
yours
hides
wrongs
and
when
you
do
them
cassius
be
content
speak
your
griefs
softly
i
do
know
you
well
before
the
eyes
of
both
our
armies
here
which
should
perceive
nothing
but
love
from
us

bid
them
move
away
then
in
my
tent
cassius
enlarge
your
griefs
and
i
will
give
you
audience
pindarus
bid
our
commanders
lead
their
charges
off
a
little
from

ground
lucilius
do
you
the
like

let
no

come
to
our
tent
till
we
have
done
our
conference
let
lucius
and
titinius
guard
our
door
that
you
have
wrongd
me
doth
appear
in
this
you
have
condemnd
and
noted
lucius
pella
for
taking
bribes
here
of
the
sardians
wherein
my
letters
praying
on
his
side
because
i
knew
the

slighted
off
you
wrongd
yourself
to
write
in
such
a
case
in
such
a
time
as
this
it
is
not
meet
that
every
nice
offence
should
bear
his
comment
let
me
tell
you
cassius
you
yourself
are
much
condemnd
to
have
an
itching
palm
to
sell
and
mart
your
offices
for
gold
to
undeservera
i
an
itching
palm
you
know
that
you
are
brutus
that
speak
this
or
by
the
gods
this
speech

this
corruption
and
chastisement
doth
therefore
hide
his

chastisement
remember

ides
of
march
remember
did
not
great
julius
bleed
for
justice
sake
what
villain
touchd
his
body
that
did
stab
and
not
for
justice
what
shall
one
of
us
that
struck
the
foremost
man
of
all
this
world
but
for
supporting
robbers
shall
we
now
contaminate
our
fingers
with
base
bribes
and
sell
the
mighty
space
of
our
large
honours
for
so
much
trash
as
may
be
grasped
thus
i

much
upon
my

i
may
do
that
i
shall
be
sorry
for
you
have
done
that
you
should
be
sorry
for
there
is
no
terror
cassius
in
your
threats
for
i
am
armd
so
strong
in
honesty
that
they
pass
by
me
as
the
idle
wind
which
i
respect
not
i
did
send
to
you
for
certain
sums
of
gold
which
you
denied
me
for
i
can
raise
no
money
by
vile
means
by
heaven
i
had
rather
coin
my
heart
and
drop
my
blood
for
drachmas
than
to
wring
from
the
hard
hands
of
peasants
their
vile
trash
by
any
indirection
i
did
send
to
you
for
gold
to
pay
my
legions
which
you
denied
me
was
that
done
like
cassius
should
i
have
answerd
caius
cassius
so
when
marcus
brutus
grows
so
covetous
to
lock
such
rascal
counters
from
his
friends
be
ready
gods
with
all
your
thunderbolts
dash
him
to
pieces
i
denied
you
not
you
did
i
did
not
he
was
but
a
fool
that
brought
my
answer
back
brutus
hath
rivd
my
heart
a
friend
should
bear
his
friends
infirmities
but
brutus
makes
mine
greater
than
they

not
like
your
faults
a
friendly
eye
could
never
see
such
faults
a
flatterers
would
not
though
they
do
appear
as
huge
as
high
olympus
come
antony
and
young
octavius
come
revenge
yourselves
alone
on
cassius
for
cassius
is
aweary
of
the
world
hated
by
one
he
loves
bravd
by
his
brother
checkd
like
a
bondman
all
his
faults
observd
set
in
a
notebook
learnd
and
connd
by
rote
to
cast
into
my
teeth
o
i
could
weep
my
spirit
from
mine
eyes
there
is
my
dagger
and
here
my
naked
breast
within
a
heart
dearer
than
plutus
mine
richer
than
gold
if
that
thou
best
a
roman
take
it
forth
i
that
denied
thee
gold
will
give
my
heart
strike
as
thou
didst
at

sar
for
i

when
thou
didst
hate

angry
when

will
dishonour
shall
be
humour
o
cassius
you
are
yoked
with
a
lamb
that
carries
anger
as
the
flint
bears
fire
who
much
enforced
shows
a
hasty
spark
and
straight
is
cold
again
hath
cassius
livd
to
be
but
mirth
and
laughter
to
his
brutus
when
grief
and
blood
illtemperd
vexeth
him
when
i
spoke
that
i
was
illtemperd
too
do
you
confess
so
much
give

your

and
my
heart
too
o
brutus
whats
the
matter

you
love
enough
to
bear
with
me
when
that
rash
humour
which
my
mother
gave

forgetful

you
immediately
to

bowl
of
wine
i
did
not
think
you
could
have
been
so
angry
o
cassius
i
am
sick
of
many
griefs
of
your
philosophy
you
make
no
use
if
you
give
place
to
accidental
evils
no
man
bears
sorrow
better
portia

portia
she
is
dead
how
scapd
i
killing
when
i
crossd
you
so
o
insupportable
and
touching
loss
upon
what
sickness
impatient
of
my
absence
and
grief
that
young
octavius
with
mark
antony
have
made
themselves
so
strong
for
with
her
death
that
tidings
came
with
this
she
fell
distract
and
her
attendants
absent
swallowd
fire
and
died
so
even
so
o
ye
immortal
gods
speak
no
more
of
her
give
me
a
bowl
of
wine
in
this
i
bury
all
unkindness
cassius
my
heart
is
thirsty
for
that
noble
pledge
fill
lucius
till
the
wine
oerswell
the
cup
i
cannot
drink
too
much
of
brutus
love
come
in
titinius
welcome
good
messala
now
sit
we
close
about
this
taper
here
and
call
in
question
our
necessities
portia
art
thou
gone
no
more
i
pray
you
messala
i
have
here
received
letters
that
young
octavius
and
mark
antony
come
down
upon
us
with
a
mighty
power
bending
their
expedition
towards
philippi
myself
have
letters
of
the
selfsame
tenour
with
what
addition
that
by
proscription
and
bills
of
outlawry
octavius
antony
and
lepidus
have
put
to
death
an
hundred
senators
therein
our
letters
do
not
well
agree
mine
speak
of
seventy
senators
that
died
by
their
proscriptions
cicero
being
one
cicero
one
cicero
is
dead
and
by
that
order
of
proscription
had
you
your
letters
from
your
wife
my
lord
no
messala
nor
nothing
in
your
letters
writ
of
her
nothing
messala
that
methinks
is
strange
why
ask
you
hear
you
aught
of
her
in
yours
no
my
lord
now
as
you
are
a
roman
tell
me
true
then
like
a
roman
bear
the
truth
i
tell
for
certain
she
is
dead
and
by
strange
manner
why
farewell
portia
we
must
die
messala
with
meditating
that
she
must
die
once
i
have
the
patience
to
endure
it
now
even
so
great
men
great
losses
should
endure
i
have
as
much
of
this
in
art
as
you
but
yet
my
nature
could
not
bear
it
so
well
to
our
work
alive
what
do
you
think
of
marching
to
philippi
presently
i
do
not
think
it
good
your
reason
this
is
it
tis
better
that
the
enemy
seek
us
so
shall
he
waste
his
means
weary
his
soldiers
doing
himself
offence
whilst
we
lying
still
are
full
of
rest
defence
and
nimbleness
good
reasons
must
of
force
give
place
to
better
the
people
twixt
philippi
and
this
ground
do
stand
but
in
a
forcd
affection
for
they
have
grudgd
us
contribution
the
enemy
marching
along
by
them
by
them
shall
make
a
fuller
number
up
come
on
refreshd
newadded
and
encouragd
from
which
advantage
shall
we
cut
him
off
if
at
philippi
we
do
face
him
there
these
people
at
our
back
hear
me
good
brother
under
your
pardon
you
must
note
beside
that
we
have
tried
the
utmost
of
our
friends
our
legions
are
brimfull
our
cause
is
ripe
the
enemy
increaseth
every
day
we
at
the
height
are
ready
to
decline
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
which
taken
at
the
flood
leads
on
to
fortune
omitted
all
the
voyage
of
their
life
is
bound
in
shallows
and
in
miseries
on
such
a
full
sea
are
we
now
afloat
and
we
must
take
the
current
when
it
serves
or
lose
our
ventures
then
with
your
will
go
on
well
along
ourselves
and
meet
them
at
philippi
the
deep
of
night
is
crept
upon
our
talk
and
nature
must
obey
necessity
which
we
will
niggard
with
a
little
rest
there
is
no
more
to
say
no
more
goodnight
early
tomorrow
will
we
rise

my

now
antony
our
hopes
are
answered
you
said
the
enemy
would
not
come
down
but
keep
the
hills
and
upper
regions
it
proves
not
so
their
battles
are
at
hand
they
mean
to
warn
us
at
philippi
here
answering
before
we
do
demand
of
them
tut
i
am
in
their
bosoms
and
i
know
wherefore
they
do
it
they
could
be
content
to
visit
other
places
and
come
down
with
fearful
bravery
thinking
by
this
face
to
fasten
in
our
thoughts
that
they
have
courage
but
tis
not
so
prepare
you
generals
the
enemy
comes
on
in
gallant
show
their
bloody
sign
of
battle
is
hung
out
and
something
to
be
done
immediately
octavius
lead
your
battle
softly
on
upon
the
left
hand
of
the
even
field
upon
the
right
hand
i
keep
thou
the
left
why
do
you
cross
me
in
this
exigent
i
do
not
cross
you
but
i
will
do
so
they
stand
and
would
have
parley
stand
fast
titinius
we
must
out
and
talk
mark
antony
shall
we
give
sign
of
battle
no
c
sar
we
will
answer
on
their
charge
make
forth
the
generals
would
have
some
words
stir
not
until
the
signal
words
before
blows
is
it
so
countrymen
not
that
we
love
words
better
as
you
do
good
words
are
better
than
bad
strokes
octavius
in
your
bad
strokes
brutus
you
give
good
words
witness
the
hole
you
made
in
c
sars
heart
crying
long
live
hail
c
sar
antony
the
posture
of
your
blows
are
yet
unknown
but
for
your
words
they
rob
the
hybla
bees
and
leave
them
honeyless
not
stingless
too
o
yes
and
soundless
too
for
you
have
stoln
their
buzzing
antony
and
very
wisely
threat
before
you
sting
villains
you
did
not
so
when
your
vile
daggers
hackd
one
another
in
the
sides
of
c
sar
how
showd
your
teeth
like
apes
and
fawnd
like
hounds
and
bowd
like
bondmen
kissing
c
sars
feet
whilst
damned
casca
like
a
cur
behind
struck
c
sar
on
the
neck
o
you
flatterers
flatterers
now
brutus
thank
yourself
this
tongue
had
not
offended
so
today
if
cassius
might
have
ruld
come
come
the
cause
if
arguing
make
us
sweat
the
proof
of
it
will
turn
to
redder
drops
look
i
draw
a
sword
against
conspirators
when
think
you
that
the
sword
goes
up
again
never
till
c
sars
threeandthirty
wounds
be
well
avengd
or
till
another
c
sar
have
added
slaughter
to
the
sword
of
traitors
c
sar
thou
canst
not
die
by
traitors
hands
unless
thou
bringst
them
with
thee
so
i
hope
i
was
not
born
to
die
on
brutus
sword
o
if
thou
wert
the
noblest
of
thy
strain
young
man
thou
couldst
not
die
more
honourable
a
peevish
schoolboy
worthless
of
such
honour
joind
with
a
masquer
and
a
reveller
old
cassius
still
come
antony
away
defiance
traitors
hurl
we
in
your
teeth
if
you
dare
fight
today
come
to
the
field
if
not
when
you
have
stomachs
why
now
blow
wind
swell
billow
and
swim
bark
the
storm
is
up
and
all
is
on
the
hazard
ho
lucilius
hark
a
word
with
you
my
lord
messala
what
says
my
general
messala
this
is
my
birthday
as
this
very
day
was
cassius
born
give
me
thy
hand
messala
be
thou
my
witness
that
against
my
will
as
pompey
was
am
i
compelld
to
set
upon
one
battle
all
our
liberties
you
know
that
i
held
epicurus
strong
and
his
opinion
now
i
change
my
mind
and
partly
credit
things
that
do
presage
coming
from
sardis
on
our
former
ensign
two
mighty
eagles
fell
and
there
they
perchd
gorging
and
feeding
from
our
soldiers
hands
who
to
philippi
here
consorted
us
this
morning
are
they
fled
away
and
gone
and
in
their
stead
do
ravens
crows
and
kites
fly
oer
our
heads
and
downward
look
on
us
as
we
were
sickly
prey
their
shadows
seem
a
canopy
most
fatal
under
which
our
army
lies
ready
to
give
up
the
ghost
believe
not
so
i
but
believe
it
partly
for
i
am
fresh
of
spirit
and
resolvd
to
meet
all
perils
very
constantly
even
so
lucilius
now
most
noble
brutus
the
gods
today
stand
friendly
that
we
may
lovers
in
peace
lead
on
our
days
to
age
but
since
the
affairs
of
men
rest
still
incertain
lets
reason
with
the
worst
that
may
befall
if
we
do
lose
this
battle
then
is
this
the
very
last
time
we
shall
speak
together
what
are
you
then
determined
to
do
even
by
the
rule
of
that
philosophy
by
which
i
did
blame
cato
for
the
death
which
he
did
give
himself
i
know
not
how
but
i
do
find
it
cowardly
and
vile
for
fear
of
what
might
fall
so
to
prevent
the
time
of
life
arming
myself
with
patience
to
stay
the
providence
of
some
high
powers
that
govern
us
below
then
if
we
lose
this
battle
you
are
contented
to
be
led
in
triumph
thorough
the
streets
of
rome
no
cassius
no
think
not
thou
noble
roman
that
ever
brutus
will
go
bound
to
rome
he
bears
too
great
a
mind
but
this
same
day
must
end
that
work
the
ides
of
march
begun
and
whether
we
shall
meet
again
i
know
not
therefore
our
everlasting
farewell
take
for
ever
and
for
ever
farewell
cassius
if
we
do
meet
again
why
we
shall
smile
if
not
why
then
this
parting
was
well
made
for
ever
and
for
ever
farewell
brutus
if
we
do
meet
again
well
smile
indeed
if
not
tis
true
this
parting
was
well
made
why
then
lead
on
o
that
a
man
might
know
the
end
of
this
days
business
ere
it
come
but
it
sufficeth
that
the
day
will
end

thrusting
it
for
piercing
steel
and
darts
envenomed

of

the
latest
service
to
my
master
this
was
the
noblest
roman
of
them
all
all
the
conspirators
save
only
he
did
that
they
did
in
envy
of
great
c
sar
he
only
in
a
general
honest
thought
and
common
good
to
all
made
one
of
them
his
life
was
gentle
and
the
elements
so
mixd
in
him
that
nature
might
stand
up
and
say
to
all
the
world
this
was
a
man
according
to
his
virtue
let
us
use
him
with
all
respect
and
rites
of
burial
within
my
tent
his
bones
tonight
shall
lie
most
like
a
soldier
orderd
honourably
so
call
the
field
to
rest
and
lets
away
to
part
the
glories
of
this
happy
day
king
lear
i
thought
the
king
had
more
affected
the
duke
of
albany
than
cornwall
it
did
always
seem
so
to
us
but
now
in
the
division
of
the
kingdom
it
appears
not
which
of
the
dukes
he
values
most
for
equalities
are
so
weighed
that
curiosity
in
neither
can
make
choice
of
eithers
moiety
is
not
this
your
son
my
lord
his
breeding
sir
hath
been
at
my
charge
i
have
so
often
blushed
to
acknowledge
him
that
now
i
am
brazed
to
it
i
cannot
conceive
you
sir
this
young
fellows
mother
could
whereupon
she
grew
roundwombed
and
had
indeed
sir
a
son
for
her
cradle
ere
she
had
a
husband
for
her
bed
do
you
smell
a
fault
i
cannot
wish
the
fault
undone
the
issue
of
it
being
so
proper
but
i
have
a
son
sir
by
order
of
law
some
year
elder
than
this
who
yet
is
no
dearer
in
my
account
though
this
knave
came
somewhat
saucily
into
the
world
before
he
was
sent
for
yet
was
his
mother
fair
there
was
good
sport
at
his
making
and
the
whoreson
must
be
acknowledged
do
you
know
this
noble
gentleman
edmund
no
my
lord
my
lord
of
kent
remember
him
hereafter
as
my
honourable
friend
my
services
to
your
lordship
i
must
love
you
and
sue
to
know
you
better
sir
i
shall
study
deserving
he
hath
been
out
nine
years
and
away
he
shall
again
the
king
is
coming
attend
the
lords
of
france
and
burgundy
gloucester
i
shall
my
liege
meantime
we
shall
express
our
darker
purpose
give
me
the
map
there
know
that
we
have
divided
in
three
our
kingdom
and
tis
our
fast
intent
to
shake
all
cares
and
business
from
our
age
conferring
them
on
younger
strengths
while
we
unburdend
crawl
toward
death
our
son
of
cornwall
and
you

no
less
loving
son
of
albany
we
have
this
hour
a
constant
will
to
publish
our
daughters
several
dowers
that
future
strife
may
be
prevented
now
the
princes
france
and
burgundy
great
rivals
in
our
youngest
daughters
love
long
in
our
court
have
made
their
amorous
sojourn
and
here
are
to
be
answerd
tell
me
my
daughters
since
now
we
will
divest
us
both
of
rule
interest
of
territory
cares
of
state
which

us
most
that

our

speak
first
sir
i
love
you
more
than

and
liberty
beyond

rich
or

no
less
than
life
with
grace
health
beauty
honour
as
much
as

a
love
that
makes
breath
poor
and
speech
unable
beyond
all
manner
of
so
much
i
love
you
what
shall
cordelia
do
love
and
be
silent
of
all
these
bounds
even
from
this
line
to
this
with
shadowy
forests
and
with
champains
richd
with
plenteous
rivers
and
wideskirted
meads

i
am
made
of
that
self
metal
as
my
sister
and
prize
me
at
her
worth
in
my
true
heart
i
find
she
names
my
very
deed
of
love
only
she
comes
too
short
that
i
profess
myself
an
enemy
to
all
other
joys
which
the
most
precious
square
of
sense
possesses
and
find
i
am
alone
felicitate
in
your
dear
highness

poor
cordelia
and
yet
not
so
since
i
am
sure
my
loves
more
richer
than
my
tongue
to
thee
and
thine
hereditary
ever
remain
this
ample
third
of
our
fair
kingdom
no
less
in

validity

bids
you

adieu
hell
shape
his
old
course
in
a
country
new
heres
france
and
burgundy
my
noble
lord
my
lord
of
burgundy
we
first
address
toward
you
who
with
this
king
hath
rivalld
for
our
daughter
what
in
the
least
will
you
require
in
present
dower
with
her
or
cease
your
quest
of
love
most
royal
majesty
i
crave
no
more
than
hath
your
highness
offerd
nor
will
you
tender
less
right
noble
burgundy
when
she
was
dear
to
us
we
did
hold
her
so
but
now
her
price
is
falln
sir
there
she
stands
if
aught
within
that
littleseeming
substance
or
all
of
it
with
our
displeasure
piecd
and
nothing
more
may
fitly
like
your
grace
shes
there
and
she
is
yours
i
know
no
answer
will
you
with
those
infirmities
she
owes
unfriended
newadopted
to
our
hate
dowerd
with
our
curse
and
strangerd
with
our
oath
take
her
or
leave
her
pardon
me
royal
sir
election
makes
not
up
on
such
conditions
then
leave
her
sir
for
by
the
power
that
made
me
i
tell
you
all
her
wealth
for
you
great
king
i
would
not
from
your
love
make
such
a
stray
to
match
you
where
i
hate
therefore
beseech
you
to
avert
your
liking
a
more
worthier
way
than
on
a
wretch
whom
nature
is
ashamd
almost
to
acknowledge
hers
this
is
most
strange
that
she
who
even
but
now
was
your
best
object
the
argument
of
your
praise
balm
of
your
age
the
best
the
dearest
should
in
this
trice
of
time
commit
a
thing
so
monstrous
to
dismantle
so
many
folds
of
favour
sure
her
offence
must
be
of
such
unnatural
degree
that
monsters
it
or
your
forevouchd
affection
fall
into
taint
which
to
believe
of
her
must
be
a
faith
that
reason
without
miracle
could
never
plant
in
me
i
yet
beseech
your
majesty
if
for
i
want
that
glib
and
oily
art
to
speak
and
purpose
not
since
what
i
well
intend
ill
do
t
before
i
speak
that
you
make
known
it
is
no
vicious
blot
nor
other
foulness
no
unchaste
action
or
dishonourd
step
that
hath
deprivd
me
of
your
grace
and
favour
but
even
for
want
of
that
for
which
i
am
richer
a
stillsoliciting
eye
and
such
a
tongue
that
i
am
glad
i
have
not
though
not
to
have
it
hath
lost
me
in
your
liking
better
thou
hadst
not
been
born
than
not
to
have
pleasd
me
better
is
it
but
this
a
tardiness
in
nature
which
often
leaves
the
history
unspoke
that
it
intends
to
do
my
lord
of
burgundy
what
say
you
to
the
lady
love
is
not
love
when
it
is
mingled
with
regards
that
stand
aloof
from
the
entire
point
will
you
have
her
she
is
herself
a
dowry
royal
lear
give
but
that
portion
which
yourself
proposd
and
here
i
take
cordelia
by
the
hand
duchess
of
burgundy
nothing
i
have
sworn
i
am
firm
i
am
sorry
then
you
have
so
lost
a
father
that
you
must
lose
a
husband
peace
be
with
burgundy
since
that
respects
of
fortune
are
his
love
i
shall
not
be
his
wife

rich

take
up
whats
cast

strange
that

their
coldst
neglect
my
love

kindle
to
inflamd
respect
thy
dowerless
daughter
king
thrown
to
my
chance

though
unkind
thou
losest
here
a
better
where
to

be
thine
for
we
have
no
such
daughter

see
that
face
of
hers
again
therefore
be
gone
without
our
grace
our
love
our
benison
come
noble
burgundy
bid
farewell
to
your
sisters
the
jewels
of
our
father
with
washd
eyes
cordelia
leaves
you
i
know
you
what
you
are
and
like
a
sister
am
most
loath
to
call
your
faults
as
they
are
namd
use
well
our
father
to
your
professed
bosoms
i
commit
him
but
yet
alas
stood
i
within
his
grace
i
would
prefer
him
to
a
better
place
so
farewell
to
you
both
prescribe
not
us
our
duties
let
your
study
be
to
content
your
lord
who
hath
receivd
you
at
fortunes
alms
you
have
obedience
scanted
and
well
are
worth
the
want
that
you
have
wanted
time
shall
unfold
what
plighted
cunning
hides
who
covers
faults
at
last
shame
them
derides
well
may
you
prosper
come
my
fair
cordelia
sister
it
is
not
little
i
have
to
say
of
what
most
nearly
appertains
to
us
both
i
think
our
father
will
hence
tonight
thats
most
certain
and
with
you
next
month
with
us
you
see
how
full
of
changes
his
age
is
the
observation
we
have
made
of
it
hath
not
been
little
he
always
loved
our
sister
most
and
with
what
poor
judgment
he
hath
now
cast
her
off
appears
too
grossly
tis
the
infirmity
of
his
age
yet
he
hath
ever
but
slenderly
known
himself
the
best
and
soundest
of
his
time
hath
been
but
rash
then
must
we
look
to
receive
from
his
age
not
alone
the
imperfections
of
longengraffed
condition
but
therewithal
the
unruly
waywardness
that
infirm
and
choleric
years
bring
with
them
such
unconstant
starts
are
we
like
to
have
from
him
as
this
of
kents
banishment
there
is
further
compliment
of
leavetaking
between
france
and
him
pray
you
let
us
hit
together
if
our
father
carry
authority
with
such
dispositions
as
he
bears
this
last
surrender
of
his
will
but
offend
us
we
shall
further
think
ont
we
must
do
something
and
i
the
heat
thou
nature
art
my
goddess
to
thy
law
my
services
are
bound
wherefore
should
i
stand
in
the
plague
of
custom
and
permit
the
curiosity
of
nations
to
deprive
me
for
that
i
am
some
twelve
or
fourteen
moonshines
lag
of
a
brother
why
bastard
wherefore

when
my
dimensions
are
as
well
compact
my
mind
as
generous
and
my
shape
as
true
as

why
brand

us
with

baseness
bastardy
base
base
who
in
the
lusty
stealth
of

take
more

so
please
your
lordship

why
so
earnestly
seek
you
to
put
up
that
letter
i
know
no
news
my
lord
what
paper
were
you
reading
nothing
my
lord
no
what
needed
then
that
terrible
dispatch
of
it
into
your
pocket
the
quality
of
nothing
hath
not
such
need
to
hide
itself
lets
see
come
if
it
be
nothing
i
shall
not
need
spectacles
i
beseech
you
sir
pardon
me
it
is
a
letter
from
my
brother
that
i
have
not
all
oerread
and
for
so
much
as
i
have
perused
i
find
it
not
fit
for
your
oerlooking
give
me
the
letter
sir
i
shall
offend
either
to
detain
or
give
it
the
contents
as
in
part
i
understand
them
are
to
blame
lets
see
lets
see
i
hope
for
my
brothers
justification
he
wrote
this
but
as
an
essay
or
taste
of
my
virtue
this
policy
and
reverence
of
age
makes
the
world
bitter
to
the
best
of
our
times
keeps
our
fortunes
from
us
till
our
oldness
cannot
relish
them
i
begin
to
find
an
idle
and
fond
bondage
in
the
oppression
of
aged
tyranny
who
sways
not
as
it
hath
power
but
as
it
is
suffered
come
to
me
that
of
this
i
may
speak
more
if
our
father
would
sleep
till
i
waked
him
you
should
enjoy
half
his
revenue
for
ever
and
live
the
beloved
of
your
brother
it
was
not
brought
me
my
lord
theres
the
cunning
of
it
i
found
it
thrown
in
at
the
casement
of
my
closet
you
know
the
character
to
be
your
brothers
if
the
matter
were
good
my
lord
i
durst
swear
it
were
his
but
in
respect
of
that
i
would
fain
think
it
were
not
it
is
his
it
is
his
hand
my
lord
but
i
hope
his
heart
is
not
in
the
contents
hath
he
never
heretofore
sounded
you
in
this
business
never
my
lord
but
i
have
often
heard
him
maintain
it
to
be
fit
that
sons
at
perfect
age
and
fathers
declined
the
father
should
be
as
ward
to
the
son
and
the
son
manage
his
revenue
o
villain
villain
his
very
opinion
in
the
letter
abhorred
villain
unnatural
detested
brutish
villain
worse
than
brutish
go
sirrah
seek
him
ill
apprehend
him
abominable
villain
where
is
he
i
do
not
well
know
my
lord
if
it
shall
please
you
to
suspend
your
indignation
against
my
brother
till
you
can
derive
from
him
better
testimony
of
his
intent
you
shall
run
a
certain
course
where
if
you
violently
proceed
against
him
mistaking
his
purpose
it
would
make
a
great
gap
in
your
own
honour
and
shake
in
pieces
the
heart
of
his
obedience
i
dare
pawn
down
my
life
for
him
that
he
hath
writ
this
to
feel
my
affection
to
your
honour
and
to
no
other
pretence
of
danger
think
you
so
if
your
honour
judge
it
meet
i
will
place
you
where
you
shall
hear
us
confer
of
this
and
by
an
auricular
assurance
have
your
satisfaction
and
that
without
any
further
delay
than
this
very
evening
he
cannot
be
such
a
monster
nor
is
not
sure
to
his
father
that
so
tenderly
and
entirely
loves
him
heaven
and
earth
edmund
seek
him
out
wind
me
into
him
i
pray
you
frame
the
business
after
your
own
wisdom
i
would
unstate
myself
to
be
in
a
due
resolution
i
will
seek
him
sir
presently
convey
the
business
as
i
shall
find
means
and
acquaint
you
withal
these
late
eclipses
in
the
sun
and
moon
portend
no
good
to
us
though
the
wisdom
of
nature
can
reason
it
thus
and
thus
yet
nature
finds
itself
scourged
by
the
sequent
effects
love
cools
friendship
falls
off
brothers
divide
in
cities
mutinies
in
countries
discord
in
palaces
treason
and
the
bond
cracked
between
son
and
father
this
villain
of
mine
comes
under
the
prediction
theres
son
against
father
the
king
falls
from
bias
of
nature
theres
father
against
child
we
have
seen
the
best
of
our
time
machinations
hollowness
treachery
and
all
ruinous
disorders
follow
us
disquietly
to
our
graves
find
out
this
villain
edmund
it
shall
lose
thee
nothing
do
it
carefully
and
the
noble
and
truehearted
kent
banished
his
offence
honesty
tis
strange
this
is
the
excellent
foppery
of
the
world
that
when
we
are
sick
in
fortune
often
the
surfeit
of
our
own
behaviour
we
make
guilty
of
our
disasters
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
stars
as
if
we
were
villains
by
necessity
fools
by
heavenly
compulsion
knaves
thieves
and
treachers
by
spherical
predominance
drunkards
liars
and
adulterers
by
an
enforced
obedience
of
planetary
influence
and
all
that
we
are
evil
in
by
a
divine
thrusting
on
an
admirable
evasion
of
whoremaster
man
to
lay
his
goatish
disposition
to
the
charge
of
a
star
my
father
compounded
with
my
mother
under
the
dragons
tail
and
my
nativity
was
under
ursa
major
so
that
it

the
maidenliest
star

twinkled
on
my
bastardizing
edgar
and
pat
he

like
the
catastrophe
of
the
old
comedy
my

villanous
melancholy

what
serious
contemplation
are
you
in
i
am
thinking
brother
of
a
prediction
i
read
this
other
day
what
should
follow
these
eclipses
do
you
busy
yourself
with
that
i
promise
you
the
effects
he
writes
of
succeed
unhappily
as
of
unnaturalness
between
the
child
and
the
parent
death
dearth
dissolutions
of
ancient
amities
divisions
in
state
menaces
and
maledictions
against
king
and
nobles
needless
diffidences
banishment
of
friends
dissipation
of
cohorts
nuptial
breaches
and
i
know
not
what
how
long
have
you
been
a
sectary
astronomical
come
come
when
saw
you
my
father
last
the
night
gone
by
spake
you
with
him
ay
two
hours
together
parted
you
in
good
terms
found
you
no
displeasure
in
him
by
word
or
countenance
none
at
all
bethink
yourself
wherein
you
may
have
offended
him
and
at
my
entreaty
forbear
his
presence
till
some
little
time
hath
qualified
the
heat
of
his
displeasure
which
at
this
instant
so
rageth
in
him
that
with
the
mischief
of
your
person
it
would
scarcely
allay
some
villain
hath
done
me
wrong
thats
my
fear
i
pray
you
have
a
continent
forbearance
till
the
speed
of
his
rage
goes
slower
and
as
i
say
retire
with
me
to
my
lodging
from
whence
i
will
fitly
bring
you
to
hear
my
lord
speak
pray
you
go

my
key

abroad

honest
man
if

any
good
meaning
toward

told
you

horror
of
it

i
hear
from
you
anon
i
do
serve
you
in
this
business
a
credulous
father
and
a
brother
noble
whose
nature
is
so
far
from
doing
harms
that
he
suspects
none
on
whose
foolish
honesty
my
practices
ride
easy
i
see
the
business
let
me
if

by
birth
have
lands
by
wit
all
with

wrongs
me

flashes
into
one
gross
crime
or
other
that

all
at
odds

be
usd
with

plain
message
bluntly
that
which
ordinary
men
are
fit
for
i
am
qualified
in
and
the
best
of
me
is
diligence
how
old
art
thou
not
so
young
sir
to
love
a
woman

on

the
roundest
manner
he
would

he
would
not
my
lord
i
know
not
what
the
matter
is
but
to
my
judgment
your
highness
is
not
entertained
with
that
ceremonious
affection
as
you
were
wont
theres
a
great
abatement
of
kindness
appears
as
well
in
the
general
dependants
as
in
the
duke
himself
also
and
your
daughter
ha
sayest
thou
so
i
beseech
you
pardon
me
my
lord
if
i
be
mistaken
for
my
duty
cannot
be
silent
when
i
think
your
highness
wronged
thou
but
rememberest
me
of
mine
own
conception
i
have
perceived
a
most
faint
neglect
of
late
which
i
have
rather
blamed
as
mine
own
jealous
curiosity
than
as
a
very
pretence
and
purpose
of
unkindness
i
will
look
further
into
t
but

protect
this
course

sir
tis
my
occupation

i
have
seen
better
faces
in
my
time
than
stands
on
any
shoulder
that
i
see
before
me
at
this
instant
this
is
some
fellow
who
having
been
praisd
for
bluntness
doth
affect
a
saucy
roughness
and
constrains
the
garb
quite
from
his
nature
he
cannot
flatter
he
an
honest
mind
and
plain
he
must
speak
truth
an
they
will
take
it
so
if
not
hes
plain
these
kind
of
knaves
i
know
which
in
this
plainness
harbour
more
craft
and
more
corrupter
ends
than
twenty
sillyducking
observants
that
stretch
their
duties
nicely
sir
in
good
sooth
in
sincere
verity
under
the
allowance
of
your
grand
aspect
whose
influence
like
the
wreath
of
radiant
fire
on
flickering
ph
bus
front
what
meanst
by
this
to
go
out
of
my
dialect
which
you
discommend
so
much
i
know
sir
i
am
no
flatterer
he
that
beguiled
you
in
a
plain
accent
was
a
plain
knave
which
for
my
part
i
will
not
be
though
i
should
win
your
displeasure
to
entreat
me
to
t
what
was
the
offence
you
gave
him
i
never
gave
him
any
it
pleasd
the
king
his
master
very
late
to
strike
at
me
upon
his
misconstruction
when
he
conjunct
and
flattering
his
displeasure
trippd
me
behind
being
down
insulted
raild

unquietly
i

the

contending
with
the
fretful
elements

earth
into

curled
waters
bove

little
world
of

to
outscorn

sir
i
do

upon
the
warrant
of
my
note
commend
a
dear
thing
to
you

cunning
twixt

as
who

not
that
their
great

seem
no
less
which
are
to
france
the
spies
and
speculations
intelligent
of
our
state
what
hath
been
seen
either
in
snuffs
and
packings
of
the
dukes
or
the
hard
rein
which
both
of
them
have
borne
against
the
old
kind
king
or
something
deeper
whereof
perchance
these
are
but
furnishings
but
true
it
is
from
france
there
comes
a
power
into
this
scatterd
kingdom
who
already
wise
in
our
negligence
have
secret
feet
in
some
of
our
best
ports
and
are
at
point
to
show
their
open
banner

to
you

credit

dare
build
so
far
to

use
of
mine

house
charged
me
on
pain
of
their
perpetual
displeasure
neither
to

of
him
entreat
for
him
nor
any
way
sustain
him
most
savage
and
unnatural
go
to
say
you

there
is
division
between
the
dukes
and
a
worse
matter
than
that

dangerous
to
be
spoken

locked
the
letter
in
my
closet
these
injuries

king
now
bears
will
be
revenged
home

will
seek
him

the
duke
instantly
know
and
of
that
letter
too

a
fair
deserving
and
must
draw
me
that
which
my
father
loses
no
less
than
all
the
younger
rises
when
the
old
doth
fall
here

he
smild
at

i
told
him
you

his
answer
was
the
worse
of
gloucesters
treachery
and
of
the
loyal
service
of
his
son
when
i
informd
him
then
he
calld
me
sot
and
told
me
i
had
turnd
the
wrong
side
out
what
most
he
should
dislike
seems
pleasant
to
him
what
like
offensive
then
shall
you
go
no
further
it
is
the
cowish
terror
of
his
spirit
that
dares
not
undertake
hell
not
feel
wrongs
which
tie
him
to
an
answer
our
wishes
on
the
way
may
prove
effects
back
edmund

contemns
its

cannot
be
borderd
certain
in

she
that

will
sliver
and
disbranch
from

vile

you
done
tigers
not

you
performd

whose
reverence
the
headluggd

would
lick
most
barbarous
most
degenerate

could
my
good

so
benefited
if
that
the

do
not
their
visible
spirits
send
quickly
down
to
tame
these
vile
offences
it
will
come
humanity
must
perforce
prey
on
itself
like
monsters
of
the
deep
milkliverd

the
reason
something
he
left
imperfect
in
the
state
which
since
his
coming
forth
is
thought
of
which
imports
to
the
kingdom
so
much
fear
and
danger
that
his
personal
return
was
most
required
and
necessary
who
hath
he
left
behind
him
general
the
marshal
of
france
monsieur
la
far
did
your
letters
pierce
the
queen
to
any
demonstration
of
grief

took
them

them
in
my
presence
and
now
and
then
an
ample
tear
trilld
down
her
delicate
cheek
it
seemd
she
was
a
queen
over
her
passion
who
most
rebellike
sought
to
be
king
oer
her
o
then
it
movd
her
not
to
a
rage
patience
and
sorrow
strove
who
should
express
her
goodliest
you
have
seen
sunshine
and
rain
at
once
her
smiles
and
tears
were
like
a
better
way
those
happy
smilets
that
playd
on
her
ripe
lip
seemd
not
to
know
what
guests
were
in
her
eyes
which
parted
thence
as
pearls
from
diamonds
droppd
in
brief
sorrow
would
be
a
rarity
most
belovd
if
all
could
so
become
it
made
she
no
verbal
question
faith
once
or
twice
she
heavd
the
name
of

shook
the

water
from

heavenly
eyes
and
clamourmoistend

away

started
to
deal
with
grief
alone
it
is
the
stars

arrives
he
moves
all
hearts
against

your

and
at
her
late
being

she

strange
ceilliades

most
speaking

to
noble
edmund
i
know
you
are
of
her
bosom
i
madam
i
speak
in
understanding

do
advise

take
this
note
my
lord
is
dead
edmund
and
i
have
talkd
and
more
convenient
is
he
for
my
hand
than
for
your
ladys
you
may
gather
more
if
you
do
find
him
pray
you
give
him
this
and
when
your
mistress
hears
thus
much
from
you
i
pray
desire
her
call
her
wisdom
to
her
so
fare
you
well
if
you
do
chance
to
hear
of
that
blind
traitor
preferment
falls
on
him
that

him
off
would
i
could
meet
him
madam
i
would
show
what
party
i
do
follow
fare
thee
well
when
shall
i
come
to
the
top
of
that
same
hill
you
do
climb
up
it
now
look
how
we
labour
methinks
the
ground
is
even
horrible
steep
hark
do
you
hear
the
sea
no
truly
why
then
you
other
senses
grow
imperfect
by
your
eyes
anguish
so
may
it
be
indeed
methinks
thy
voice
is
alterd
and
thou
speakst
in
better
phrase
and
matter
than
thou
didst
yare
much
deceivd
in
nothing
am
i
changd
but
in
my
garments
methinks
youre
better
spoken
come
on
sir
heres
the
place
stand
still
how
fearful
and
dizzy
tis
to
cast
ones
eyes
so
low
the
crows
and
choughs
that
wing
the
midway
air
show
scarce
so
gross
as
beetles
half
way
down
hangs
one
that
gathers
samphire
dreadful
trade
methinks
he
seems
no
bigger
than
his
head
the
fishermen
that
walk
upon
the
beach
appear
like
mice
and
yond
tall
anchoring
bark
diminishd
to
her
cock
her
cock
a
buoy
almost
too
small
for
sight
the
murmuring
surge
that
on
the
unnumberd
idle
pebbles
chafes
cannot
be
heard
so
high
ill
look
no
more
lest
my
brain
turn
and
the
deficient
sight
topple
down
headlong
set
me
where
you
stand
give
me
your
hand
you
are
now
within
a
foot
of
the
extreme
verge
for
all
beneath
the
moon
would
i
not
leap
upright
let
go
my
hand
here
friend

another
purse
in

further
off

me
farewell
and
let
me
hear
thee
going
now
fare

well
good
sir
with
all
my
heart
why

do
trifle
thus
with
his
despair
is
done
to
cure
it
o
you
mighty
gods
this
world
i
do
renounce
and
in
your
sights
shake
patiently
my
great
affliction
off
if
i
could
bear
it
longer
and
not
fall
to
quarrel
with
your
great
opposeless
wills
my
snuff
and
loathed
part
of
nature
should
burn
itself
out
if
edgar
live
o
bless
him
now
fellow
fare
thee
well
gone
sir
farewell
and
yet
i
know
not
how
conceit
may
rob
the
treasury
of
life
when
life
itself
yields
to
the
theft
had
he
been
where
he
thought
by
this
had
thought
been
past
alive
or
dead
ho
you
sir
friend
hear
you

speak
thus
might
he
pass
indeed
yet
he
revives
what
are
you

away
and
let
me
die
hadst
thou
been
aught
but
gossamer
feathers
air
so
many
fathom
down
precipitating
thoudst
shiverd
like
an
egg
but
thou
dost
breathe
hast
heavy
substance
bleedst
not
speakst
art
sound
ten
masts
at
each
make
not
the
altitude
which
thou
hast
perpendicularly
fell
thy
lifes
a
miracle
speak
yet
again
but
have
i
fallen
or
no
from
the
dread
summit
of
this
chalky
bourn

the
shrillgorgd
lark
so
far
cannot
be
seen
or
heard
do
but
look
up
alack
i
have
no
eyes
is
wretchedness
deprivd
that
benefit
to
end
itself
by
death
twas
yet
some
comfort
when
misery
could
beguile
the
tyrants
rage
and
frustrate
his
proud
will
give
me
your
arm
up
so
how
is
t
feel
you
your
legs
you
stand
too
well

above
all
strangeness
upon
the
crown
o
the
cliff
what
thing
was
that
which
parted
from
you
a

sir
you

today
your
valiant
strain

fortune
led
you
well
you
have
the
captives
who
were
the
opposites
of
this
days
strife
we
do
require
them
of
you
so
to
use
them
as
we
shall
find
their
merits
and
our
safety
may
equally
determine
sir
i
thought
it
fit
to
send
the
old
and
miserable
king
to
some
retention
and
appointed
guard
whose
age
has
charms
in
it
whose
title
more
to
pluck
the
common
bosom
on
his
side
and
turn
our
impressd
lances
in
our
eyes
which
do
command
them
with

all
the

lost
his
friend

the
best
quarrels
in
the
heat
are
cursd
by
those
that
feel
their
sharpness
the
question
of
cordelia
and
her
father
requires
a
fitter
place
sir
by
your
patience
i
hold
you
but
a
subject
of
this
war
not
as
a
brother
thats
as
we
list
to
grace
him

our
pleasure
might
have
been
demanded
ere
you
had
spoke
so
far
he
led
our
powers
bore
the
commission
of
my
place
and
person
the
which
immediacy
may
well
stand
up

call
itself
your
brother

so
hot

list
a
brief
tale
and
when
tis
told
o
that
my
heart
would
burst
the
bloody
proclamation
to
escape
that
followd
me
so
near
o
our
lives
sweetness
that
we
the
pain
of
death
would
hourly
die
rather
than
die
at
once
taught
me
to
shift
into
a
madmans
rags
to
assume
a
semblance
that
very
dogs
disdaind
and
in
this
habit
met
i
my
father
with
his
bleeding
rings
their
precious
stones
new
lost
became
his
guide
led
him
beggd
for
him
savd
him
from
despair
never
o
fault
reveald
myself
unto
him
until
some
half
hour
past
when
i
was
armd
not
sure
though
hoping
of
this
good
success
i
askd
his
blessing
and
from
first
to
last
told
him
my
pilgrimage
but
his
flawd
heart
alack
too
weak
the
conflict
to
support
twixt
two
extremes
of
passion
joy
and
grief
burst
smilingly
this
speech
of
yours
hath
movd
me
and
shall
perchance
do
good
but
speak
you
on
you
look
as
you
had
something
more
to
say
if
there
be
more
more
woeful
hold
it
in
for
i
am
almost
ready
to
dissolve
hearing
of
this
this
would
have
seemd
a
period
to
such
as
love
not
sorrow
but
another
to
amplify
too
much
would
make
much
more
and
top
extremity
whilst
i
was
big
in
clamour
came
there
a
man
who
having
seen
me
in
my

ear
receivd

puissant

good
sir
why
do
you
start
and
seem
to
fear
things
that
do
sound
so
fair
i
the
name
of
truth
are
ye
fantastical
or
that
indeed
which
outwardly
ye
show
my
noble
partner
you
greet
with

grace
and
great
prediction
of
noble
having
and
of
royal
hope
that
he
seems
rapt
withal
to
me
you
speak
not
if
you
can
look
into
the
seeds
of

and
say
which

stay
you
imperfect
speakers
tell
me
more
by

death
i
know
i
am
thane
of
glamis
but
how
of
cawdor
the
thane
of
cawdor
lives
a
prosperous
gentleman
and
to
be
king
stands
not
within
the
prospect
of
belief
no
more
than
to
be
cawdor
say
from
whence
you
owe
this
strange
intelligence
or
why
upon
this
blasted
heath
you
stop
our
way
with
such
prophetic
greeting
speak
i
charge
you
the
earth
hath
bubbles
as
the
water
has
and
these
are
of
them
whither
are
they
vanishd
into
the
air
and
what
seemd
corporal
melted
as
breath
into
the
wind
would
they
had
stayd
were
such
things
here
as
we
do
speak
about
or
have
we
eaten
on
the
insane
root
that
takes
the
reason
prisoner
your
children
shall
be
kings
you
shall
be
king
and
thane
of
cawdor
too
went
it
not
so
to
the
selfsame
tune
and
words
whos
here
the
king
hath
happily
receivd
macbeth
the
news
of
thy
success
and
when
he
reads
thy
personal
venture
in
the
rebels
fight
his
wonders
and
his
praises
do
contend
which
should
be
thine
or
his
silencd
with
that
in
viewing
oer
the
rest
o
the
selfsame
day
he
finds
thee
in
the
stout
norweyan
ranks
nothing
afeard
of
what
thyself
didst
make
strange
images
of
death
as
thick
as
hail
came
post
with
post
and
every
one
did
bear
thy
praises
in
his
kingdoms
great
defence
and
pourd
them
down
before
him
we
are
sent
to
give
thee
from
our
royal
master
thanks
only
to
herald
thee
into
his
sight
not
pay
thee
and
for
an
earnest
of
a
greater
honour
he
bade
me
from
him
call
thee
thane
of
cawdor
in
which
addition
hail
most
worthy
thane
for
it
is
thine
what
can
the
devil
speak
true
the
thane
of
cawdor
lives
why
do
you
dress
me
in
borrowd
robes
who
was
the
thane
lives
yet
but
under
heavy
judgment
bears
that
life
which
he
deserves
to
lose
whether
he
was
combind
with
those
of
norway
or
did
line
the
rebel
with
hidden
help
or
vantage
or
that
with
both
he
labourd
in
his
countrys
wrack
i
know
not
but
treasons
capital
confessd
and
provd
have
overthrown
him
glamis
and
thane
of
cawdor
the
greatest
is
behind
thanks
for
your
pains
do
you
not
hope
your
children
shall
be
kings
when
those
that
gave
the
thane
of
cawdor
to
me
promisd
no
less
to
them
that
trusted
home
might
yet
enkindle
you
unto
the
crown
besides
the
thane
of
cawdor
but
tis
strange
and
oftentimes
to
win
us
to
our
harm
the
instruments
of
darkness
tell
us
truths
win
us
with
honest
trifles
to
betrays
in
deepest
consequence
cousins
a
word
i
pray
you
two
truths
are
told
as
happy
prologues
to
the
swelling
act
of
the
imperial
theme
i
thank
you
gentlemen
this
supernatural
soliciting
cannot
be
ill
cannot
be
good
if
ill
why
hath
it
given
me
earnest
of
success
commencing
in
a
truth
i
am
thane
of
cawdor
if
good
why
do
i
yield
to
that
suggestion
whose
horrid
image
doth
unfix
my
hair
and
make
my
seated
heart
knock
at
my
ribs
against
the
use
of
nature
present
fears
are
less
than
horrible
imaginings
my
thought
whose
murder
yet
is
but
fantastical
shakes
so
my
single
state
of
man
that
function
is
smotherd
in
surmise
and
nothing
is
but
what
is
not
look
how
our
partners
rapt
if
chance
will
have
me
king
why
chance
may
crown
me
without
my
stir
new
honours
come
upon
him
like
our
strange
garments
cleave
not
to
their
mould
but
with
the
aid
of
use
come
what
come
may
time
and
the
hour
runs
through
the
roughest
day
worthy
macbeth
we
stay
upon
your
leisure
give
me
your
favour
my
dull
brain
was
wrought
with
things
forgotten
kind
gentlemen
your
pains
are
registerd
where
every
day
i
turn
the
leaf
to
read
them
let
us
toward
the
king
think
upon
what
hath
chancd
and
at
more
time
the
interim
having
weighd
it
let
us
speak
our
free
hearts
each
to
other
very
gladly
till
then
enough
come
friends
is
execution
done
on
cawdor
are
not
those
in
commission
yet
returnd
my
liege
they
are
not
yet
come
back
but
i
have
spoke
with
one
that
saw
him
die
who
did
report
that
very
frankly
he
confessd
his
treasons
implord
your
highness
pardon
and
set
forth
a
deep
repentance
nothing
in
his
life
became
him
like
the
leaving
it
he
died
as
one
that
had
been
studied
in
his
death
to
throw
away
the
dearest
thing
he
owd
as
twere
a
careless
trifle
theres
no
art
to
find
the
minds
construction
in
the
face
he
was
a
gentleman
on
whom
i
built
an
absolute
trust
o
worthiest
cousin
the
sin
of
my
ingratitude
even
now
was
heavy
on
me
thou
art
so
far
before
that
swiftest
wing
of
recompense
is
slow
to
overtake
thee
would
thou
hadst
less
deservd
that
the
proportion
both
of
thanks
and
payment
might
have
been
mine
only
i
have
left
to
say
more
is
thy
due
than
more
than
all
can
pay
the
service
and
the
loyalty
i
owe
in
doing
it
pays
itself
your
highness
part
is
to
receive
our
duties
and
our
duties
are
to
your
throne
and
state
children
and
servants
which
do
but
what
they
should
by
doing
everything
safe
toward
your
love
and
honour
welcome
hither
i
have
begun
to
plant
thee
and
will
labour
to
make
thee
full
of
growing
noble
banquo
that
hast
no
less
deservd
nor
must
be
known
no
less
to
have
done
so
let
me
infold
thee
and
hold
thee
to
my
heart
there
if
i
grow
the
harvest
is
your
own
my
plenteous
joys
wanton
in
fulness
seek
to
hide
themselves
in
drops
of
sorrow
sons
kinsmen
thanes
and
you
whose
places
are
the
nearest
know
we
will
establish
our
estate
upon
our
eldest
malcolm
whom
we
name
hereafter
the
prince
of
cumberland
which
honour
must
not
unaccompanied
invest
him
only
but
signs
of
nobleness
like
stars
shall
shine
on
all
deservers
from
hence
to
inverness
and
bind
us
further
to
you
the
rest
is
labour
which
is
not
usd
for
you
ill
be
myself
the
harbinger
and
make
joyful
the
hearing
of
my
wife
with
your
approach
so
humbly
take
my
leave
my
worthy
cawdor
the
prince
of
cumberland
that
is
a
step
on
which
i
must
fall
down
or
else
oerleap
for
in
my
way
it
lies
stars
hide
your
fires
let
not
light
see
my
black
and
deep
desires
the
eye
wink
at
the
hand
yet
let
that
be
which
the
eye
fears
when
it
is
done
to
see
true
worthy
banquo
he
is
full
so
valiant
and
in
his
commendations
i
am
fed
it
is
a
banquet
to
me
lets
after
him
whose
care
is
gone
before
to
bid
us
welcome
it
is
a
peerless
kinsman
they
met
me
in
the
day
of
success
and
i
have
learned
by
the
perfectest
report
they
have
more
in
them
than
mortal
knowledge
when
i
burned
in
desire
to
question
them
further
they
made
themselves
air
into
which
they
vanished
whiles
i
stood
rapt
in
the
wonder
of
it
came
missives
from
the
king
who
allhailed
me
thane
of
cawdor
by
which
title
before
these
weird
sisters
saluted
me
and
referred
me
to
the
coming
on
of
time
with
hail
king
that
shall
be
this
have
i
thought
good
to
deliver
thee
my
dearest
partner
of
greatness

thou
mightest
not
lose
the
dues
of
rejoicing
by
being
ignorant
of
what
greatness
is
promised
thee
lay
it
to
thy
heart
and
farewell
glamis

is
too
full
o
the
milk
of
human
kindness
to
catch
the
nearest
way
thou
wouldst
be
great
art
not
without
ambition
but
without
the
illness
should
attend
it
what
thou
wouldst
highly
that
thou
wouldst
holily
wouldst
not
play
false
and
yet
wouldst
wrongly
win
thoudst
have
great
glamis
that
which
cries
thus
thou
must
do
if
thou
have
it
and
that
which
rather
thou
dost
fear
to
do
than
wishest
should
be
undone
hie
thee
hither
that
i
may
pour
my
spirits
in
thine
ear
and
chastise
with
the
valour
of
my
tongue
all
that
impedes
thee
from
the
golden
round
which
fate
and
metaphysical
aid
doth
seem
to
have
thee
crownd
withal

up
his
message
give
him
tending

brings
great
news

of
direst
cruelty

access
and
passage
to
remorse
that
no
compunctious
visitings
of
nature

my
fell
purpose
nor

peace
between
the
effect
and
it

sovereign
sway
and
masterdom
we
will
speak

only
look
up
clear
to
alter
favour
ever
is
to
fear
leave
all
the
rest
to
me
this
castle
hath
a
pleasant
seat
the
air
nimbly
and
sweetly
recommends
itself
unto
our
gentle
senses
this
guest
of
summer
the
templehaunting
martlet
does
approve
by
his
lovd
mansionry
that
the
heavens
breath
smells
wooingly
here
no
jutty
frieze
buttress
nor
coign
of
vantage
but
this
bird
hath
made
his
pendent
bed
and
procreant
cradle
where
they
most
breed
and
haunt
i
have
observd
the
air
is
delicate
see
see
our
honourd
hostess
the
love
that
follows
us
sometime
is
our
trouble
which
still
we
thank
as
love
herein
i
teach
you
how
you
shall
bid
god
eyld
us
for
your
pains
and
thank
us
for
your
trouble
all
our
service
in
every
point
twice
done
and
then
done
double
were
poor
and
single
business
to
contend
against
those
honours
deep
and
broad
wherewith
your
majesty
loads
our
house
for
those
of
old
and
the
late
dignities
heapd
up
to
them
we
rest
your
hermits
wheres
the
thane
of
cawdor
we
coursd
him
at
the
heels
and
had
a
purpose
to
be
his
purveyor
but
he
rides
well
and
his
great
love
sharp
as
his
spur
hath
holp
him
to
his
home
before
us
fair
and
noble
hostess
we
are
your
guest
tonight
your
servants
ever
have
theirs
themselves
and
what
is
theirs
in
compt
to
make
their
audit
at
your
highness
pleasure
still
to
return
your
own
give
me
your
hand
conduct
me
to
mine
host
we
love
him
highly
and
shall
continue
our
graces
towards
him
by
your
leave
hostess
if
it
were
done
when
tis
done
then
twere
well
it
were
done
quickly
if
the
assassination
could
trammel
up
the
consequence
and
catch
with
his
surcease
success
that
but
this
blow
might
be
the
beall
and
the
endall
here
but
here
upon
this
bank
and
shoal
of
time
wed
jump
the
life
to
come
but
in
these
cases
we
still
have
judgment
here
that
we
but
teach
bloody
instructions
which
being
taught
return
to
plague
the
inventor
this
evenhanded
justice
commends
the
ingredients
of
our
poisond
chalice
to
our
own
lips
hes
here
in
double
trust
first
as
i
am
his
kinsman
and
his
subject
strong
both
against
the
deed
then
as
his
host
who
should
against
his
murderer
shut
the
door
not
bear
the
knife
myself
besides
this
duncan
hath
borne
his
faculties
so
meek
hath
been
so
clear
in
his
great
office
that
his
virtues
will
plead
like
angels
trumpettongud
against
the
deep
damnation
of
his
takingoff
and
pity
like
a
naked
newborn
babe
striding
the
blast
or
heavens
cherubin
horsd
upon
the
sightless
couriers
of
the
air
shall
blow
the
horrid
deed
in
every
eye
that
tears
shall
drown
the
wind
i
have
no
spur
to
prick
the
sides
of
my
intent
but
only
vaulting
ambition
which
oerleaps
itself
and
falls
on
the
other
how
now
what
news
he
has
almost
suppd
why
have
you
left
the
chamber
hath
he
askd
for
me
know
you
not
he
has
we
will
proceed
no
further
in
this
business
he
hath
honourd
me
of
late
and
i
have
bought
golden
opinions
from
all
sorts
of
people
which
would
be
worn
now
in
their
newest
gloss
not
cast
aside
so
soon
was
the
hope
drunk
wherein
you
dressd
yourself
hath
it
slept
since
and
wakes
it
now
to
look
so
green
and
pale
at
what
it
did
so
freely
from
this
time
such
i
account
thy
love
art
thou
afeard
to
be
the
same
in
thine
own
act
and
valour
as
thou
art
in
desire
wouldst
thou
have
that
which
thou
esteemst
the
ornament
of
life
and
live
a
coward
in
thine
own
esteem
letting
i
dare
not
wait
upon
i
would
like
the
poor
cat
i
the
adage
prithee
peace
i
dare
do
all
that
may
become
a
man
who
dares
do
more
is
none
what
beast
wast
then
that
made
you
break
this
enterprise
to
me
when
you
durst
do
it
then
you
were
a
man
and
to
be
more
than
what
you
were
you
would
be
so
much
more
the
man
nor
time
nor
place
did
then
adhere
and
yet
you
would
make
both
they
have
made
themselves
and
that
their
fitness
now
does
unmake
you
i
have
given
suck
and
know
how
tender
tis
to
love
the
babe
that
milks
me
i
would
while
it
was
smiling
in
my
face
have
pluckd
my
nipple
from
his
boneless
gums
and
dashd
the
brains
out
had
i
so
sworn
as
you
have
done
to
this
if
we
should
fail
we
fail
but
screw
your
courage
to
the
stickingplace
and
well
not
fail
when
duncan
is
asleep
whereto
the
rather
shall
his
days
hard
journey
soundly
invite
him
his
two
chamberlains
will
i
with
wine
and
wassail
so
convince
that
memory
the
warder
of
the
brain
shall
be
a
fume
and
the
receipt
of
reason
a
limbeck
only
when
in
swinish
sleep
their
drenched
natures
lie
as
in
a
death
what
cannot
you
and
i
perform
upon
the
unguarded
duncan
what
not
put
upon
his
spongy
officers
who
shall
bear
the
guilt
of
our
great
quell
bring
forth
menchildren
only
for
thy
undaunted
mettle
should
compose
nothing
but
males
will
it
not
be
receivd
when
we
have
markd
with
blood
those
sleepy
two
of
his
own
chamber
and
usd
their
very
daggers
that
they
have
donet
who
dares
receive
it
other
as
we
shall
make
our
griefs
and
clamour
roar
upon
his
death
i
am
settled
and
bend
up
each
corporal
agent
to
this
terrible
feat
away
and
mock
the
time
with
fairest
show
false
face
must
hide
what
the
false
heart
doth
know
how
goes
the
night
boy
the
moon
is
down
i
have
not
heard
the
clock
and
she
goes
down
at
twelve
i
taket
tis
later
sir
hold
take
my
sword
theres
husbandry
in
heaven
their
candles
are
all
out
take
thee
that
too
a
heavy
summons
lies
like
lead
upon
me
and
yet
i
would
not
sleep
merciful
powers
restrain
in
me
the
cursed
thoughts
that
nature
gives
way
to
in
repose
give
me
my
sword
whos
there
a
friend
what
sir
not
yet
at
rest
the
kings
abed
he
hath
been
in
unusual
pleasure
and
sent
forth
great
largess
to
your
offices
this
diamond
he
greets
your
wife
withal
by
the
name
of
most
kind
hostess
and
shut
up
in
measureless
content
being
unprepard
our
will
became
the
servant
to
defect
which
else
should
free
have
wrought
alls
well
i
dreamt
last
night
of
the
three
weird
sisters
to
you
they
have
showd
some
truth
i
think
not
of
them
yet
when
we
can
entreat
an
hour
to
serve
we
would
spend
it
in
some
words
upon
that
business
if
you
would
grant
the
time
at
your
kindst
leisure
if
you
shall
cleave
to
my
consent
when
tis
it
shall
make
honour
for
you
so
i
lose
none
in
seeking
to
augment
it
but
still
keep
my
bosom
franchisd
and
allegiance
clear
i
shall
be
counselld
good
repose
the
while
thanks

like
to
you
go
bid
thy
mistress
when
my
drink
is
ready
she
strike
upon
the
bell

thee
to
bed
is
this
a
dagger
which
i
see
before
me
the
handle
toward
my
hand
come
let
me
clutch
thee
i
have
thee
not
and
yet
i
see
thee
still
art
thou
not
fatal
vision
sensible
to
feeling
as
to
sight
or
art
thou
but
a
dagger
of
the
mind
a
false
creation
proceeding
from
the
heatoppressed
brain
i
see
thee
yet
in
form
as
palpable
as
this
which
now
i
draw
thou
marshallst
me
the
way
that
i
was
going
and
such
an
instrument
i
was
to
use
mine
eyes
are
made
the
fools
o
the
other
senses
or
else
worth
all
the
rest
i
see
thee
still
and
on
thy
blade
and
dudgeon
gouts
of
blood
which
was
not
so
before
theres
no
such
thing
it
is
the
bloody
business
which
informs
thus
to
mine
eyes
now
oer
the
one
halfworld
nature
seems
dead
and
wicked
dreams
abuse
the
curtaind
sleep
witchcraft
celebrates
pale
hecates
offerings
and
witherd
murder
alarumd
by
his
sentinel
the
wolf
whose
howls
his
watch
thus
with
his
stealthy
pace
with
tarquins
ravishing
strides
toward
his
design
moves
like
a
ghost
thou
sure
and
firmset
earth
hear
not
my
steps
which
way
they
walk
for
fear
thy
very
stones
prate
of
my
whereabout
and
take
the
present
horror
from
the
time
which
now
suits
with
it
whiles
i
threat
he
lives
words
to
the
heat
of
deeds
too
cold
breath
gives
i
go
and
it
is
done
the
bell
invites
me
hear
it
not
duncan
for
it
is
a
knell
that
summons
thee
to
heaven
or
to
hell
that
which
hath
made
them
drunk
hath
made
me
bold
what
hath
quenchd
them
hath
given
me
fire
hark
peace
it
was
the
owl
that
shriekd
the
fatal
bellman
which
gives
the
sternst
goodnight
he
is
about
it
the
doors
are
open
and
the
surfeited
grooms
do
mock
their
charge
with
snores
i
have
druggd
their
possets
that
death
and
nature
do
contend
about
them
whether
they
live
or
die
whos
there
what
ho
alack
i
am
afraid
they
have
awakd
and
tis
not
done
the
attempt
and
not
the
deed
confounds
us
hark
i
laid
their
daggers
ready
he
could
not
miss
them
had
he
not
resembled
my
father
as
he
slept
i
had
done
t
my
husband
i
have
done
the
deed
didst
thou
not
hear
a
noise
i
heard
the
owl
scream
and
the
crickets
cry
did
not
you
speak
when
now
as
i
descended
ay
hark
who
lies
i
the
second
chamber
donalbain
this
is
a
sorry
sight
a
foolish
thought
to
say
a
sorry
sight
theres
one
did
laugh
in
s
sleep
and
one
cried
murder
that
they
did
wake
each
other
i
stood
and
heard
them
but
they
did
say
their
prayers
and
addressd
them
again
to
sleep
there
are
two
lodgd
together
one
cried
god
bless
us
and
amen
the
other
as
they
had
seen
me
with
these
hangmans
hands
listening
their
fear
i
could
not
say
amen
when
they
did
say
god
bless
us
consider
it
not
so
deeply
but
wherefore
could
not
i
pronounce
amen
i
had
most
need
of
blessing
and
amen
stuck
in
my
throat
these
deeds
must
not
be
thought
after
these
ways
so
it
will
make
us
mad
methought
i
heard
a
voice
cry
sleep
no
more
macbeth
does
murder
sleep
the
innocent
sleep
sleep
that
knits
up
the
ravelld
sleave
of
care
the
death
of
each
days
life
sore
labours
bath
balm
of
hurt
minds
great
natures
second
course
chief
nourisher
in
lifes
feast
what
do
you
mean

that
thus
cried
why
worthy
thane

do
unbend
your
noble
strength
to
think
so
brainsickly
of
things
go
get
some
water
and
wash
this
filthy
witness
from
your
hand
why
did
you
bring
these
daggers
from
the
place
they
must
lie
there
go
carry
them
and
smear
the
sleepy
grooms
with
blood
ill
go
no
more
i
am
afraid
to
think
what
i
have
done
look
on
t
again
i
dare
not
infirm
of
purpose
give
me
the
daggers
the
sleeping
and
the
dead
are
but
as
pictures
tis
the
eye
of
childhood
that
fears
a
painted
devil
if
he
do
bleed
ill
gild
the
faces
of
the
grooms
withal
for
it
must
seem
their
guilt
whence
is
that
knocking
how
ist
with
me
when
every
noise
appals
me
what
hands
are
here
ha
they
pluck
out
mine
eyes
will
all
great
neptunes
ocean
wash
this
blood
clean
from
my
hand
no
this
my
hand
will
rather
the
multitudinous
seas
incarnadine
making
the
green
one
red
my
hands
are
of
your
colour

i
shame
to
wear
a
heart
so
white
i
hear
a
knocking
at
the
south
entry
retire
we
to
our
chamber
a
little
water
clears
us
of
this
deed
how
easy
is
it
then
your
constancy
hath
left
you
unattended
hark
more
knocking
get
on
your
nightgown
lest
occasion
call
us
and
show
us
to
be
watchers

not
lost
so
poorly
in
your
thoughts
to
know
my
deed

about
you
here
youll
sweat
for
t
knocking

heres
an
equivocator
that
could
swear
in
both
the
scales
against
either
scale
who
committed
treason
enough
for
gods
sake
yet
could
not
equivocate
to
heaven
o
come
in
equivocator
knocking
within
knock
knock
knock
whos
there
faith
heres
an
english
tailor
come
hither
for
stealing

here
you
may
roast
your

knocking

knock
never
at
quiet
what
are
you
but
this
place
is
too
cold
for
hell
ill
devilporter
it
no
further
i
had
thought
to
have

late
faith
sir
we
were
carousing
till
the
second
cock
and
drink
sir
is
a
great
provoker
of
three
things
what
three
things
does
drink
especially
provoke
marry
sir
mosepainting
sleep
and
urine
lechery
sir
it
provokes
and
unprovokes
it
provokes
the
desire
but
it
takes
away
the
performance
therefore
much
drink
may
be
said
to
be
an
equivocator
with
lechery
it
makes
him
and
it
mars
him
it
sets
him
on
and
it
takes
him
off
it
persuades
him
and
disheartens
him
makes
him
stand
to
and
not
stand
to
in
conclusion
equivocates
him
in
a
sleep
and
giving
him
the
lie
leaves
him
i
believe
drink
gave
thee
the
lie
last
night
that
it
did
sir
i
the
very
throat
o
me
but
i
requited
him
for
his
lie
and
i
think
being
too
strong
for
him
though
he
took
up
my
legs
sometime
yet
i
made
a
shift
to
cast
him
is
thy
master

but
died
an
hour
before
this
chance
i
had
livd
a
blessed
time
for
from
this
instant
theres
nothing
serious
in
mortality
all
is
but
toys
renown
and
grace
is
dead
the
wine
of
life
is
drawn
and
the
mere
lees
is
left
this
vault
to
brag
of
what
is
amiss
you
are
and
do
not
know
t
the
spring
the
head
the
fountain
of
your
blood
is
stoppd
the
very
source
of
it
is
stoppd
your
royal
fathers
murderd
o
by
whom
those
of
his
chamber
as
it
seemd
had
done
t
their
hands
and
faces
were
all
badgd
with
blood
so
were
their
daggers
which
unwipd
we
found
upon
their
pillows
they
stard
and
were
distracted
no
mans
life
was
to
be
trusted
with
them
o
yet
i
do
repent
me
of
my
fury
that
i
did
kill
them
wherefore
did
you
so
who
can
be
wise
amazd
temperate
and
furious
loyal
and
neutral
in
a
moment
no
man
the
expedition
of
my
violent
love
outran
the
pauser
reason
here
lay
duncan
his
silver
skin
lacd
with
his
golden
blood
and
his
gashd
stabs
lookd
like
a
breach
in
nature
for
ruins
wasteful
entrance
there
the
murderers
steepd
in
the
colours
of
their
trade
their
daggers
unmannerly
breechd
with
gore
who
could
refrain
that
had
a
heart
to
love
and
in
that
heart
courage
to
make
s
love
known
help
me
hence
ho
look
to
the
lady
why
do
we
hold
our
tongues
that
most
may
claim
this
argument
for
ours
what
should
be
spoken
here
where
our
fate
hid
in
an
augerhole
may
rush
and
seize
us
lets
away
our
tears
are
not
yet
brewd
nor
our
strong
sorrow
upon
the
foot
of
motion
look
to
the
lady
and
when
we
have
our
naked
frailties
hid
that
suffer
in
exposure
let
us
meet
and
question
this
most
bloody
piece
of
work
to
know
it
further
fears
and
scruples
shake
us
in
the
great
hand
of
god
i
stand
and
thence
against
the
undivulgd
pretence
i
fight
of
treasonous
malice
and
so
do
i
so
all
lets
briefly
put
on
manly
readiness
and
meet
i
the
hall
together
well
contented
what
will
you
do
lets
not
consort
with
them
to
show
an
unfelt
sorrow
is
an
office
which
the
false
man
does
easy
ill
to
england
to
ireland
i
our
separated
fortune
shall
keep
us
both
the
safer
where
we
are
theres
daggers
in
mens
smiles
the
near
in
blood
the
nearer
bloody
this
murderous
shaft
thats
shot
hath
not
yet
lighted
and
our
safest
way
is
to
avoid
the
aim
therefore
to
horse
and
let
us
not
be
dainty
of
leavetaking
but
shift
away
theres
warrant
in
that
theft
which
steals
itself
when
theres
no
mercy
left
threescore
and
ten
i
can
remember
well
within
the
volume
of
which
time
i
have
seen
hours
dreadful
and
things
strange
but
this
sore
night
hath
trifled
former
knowings
ah
good
father
thou
seest
the
heavens
as
troubled
with
mans
act
threaten
his
bloody
stage
by
the
clock
tis
day
and
yet
dark
night
strangles
the
travelling
lamp
is
t
nights
predominance
or
the
days
shame
that
darkness
does
the
face
of
earth
entomb
when
living
light
should
kiss
it
tis
unnatural
even
like
the
deed
thats
done
on
tuesday
last
a
falcon
towering
in
her
pride
of
place
was
by
a
mousing
owl
hawkd
at
and
killd
and
duncans
horses
a
thing
most
strange
and
certain
beauteous
and
swift
the
minions
of
their
race
turnd
wild
in
nature
broke
their
stalls
flung
out
contending
gainst
obedience
as
they
would
make
war
with
mankind
tis
said
they
eat
each
other
they
did
so
to
the
amazement
of
mine
eyes
that
lookd
upon
t
here
comes
the
good
macduff
how
goes

bloody
deed

day

good
could
they
pretend
they
were
subornd
malcolm
and
donalbain
the
kings
two
sons
are
stoln
away
and
fled
which
puts
upon
them
suspicion
of
the
deed
gainst
nature
still
thriftless
ambition
that
wilt
ravin
up
thine
own
lifes
means
then
tis
most
like
the
sovereignty
will
fall
upon
macbeth
he
is
already
namd
and
gone
to
scone
to
be
invested
where
is
duncans

father
of
many
kings

the
sisters
when
first
they
put
the
name

prophetlike
they
haild
him
father
to
a
line
of
kings
upon
my
head
they
placd
a
fruitless
crown
and
put
a
barren
sceptre
in
my
gripe

to
be
wrenchd
with
an
unlineal
hand

son
of
mine
succeeding
if

of
my
speeches

that
it
was
he
in
the
times
past
which
held
you
so
under
fortune
which
you
thought
had
been
our
innocent
self
this
i
made
good
to
you
in
our
last
conference
passd
in
probation
with
you
how
you
were
borne
in
hand
how
crossd
the
instruments
who
wrought
with
them
and
all
things
else
that
might
to
half
a
soul
and
to
a
notion
crazd
say
thus
did
banquo
you
made
it
known
to
us
i
did
so
and
went
further
which
is
now
our
point
of
second
meeting
do
you
find
your
patience
so
predominant
in
your
nature
that
you
can
let
this
go
are
you
so
gospelld
to
pray
for
this
good
man
and
for
his
issue
whose
heavy
hand
hath
bowd
you
to
the
grave
and
beggard
yours
for
ever
we
are
men
my
liege
ay
in
the
catalogue
ye
go
for
men
as
hounds
and
greyhounds
mongrels
spaniels
curs
shoughs
waterrugs
and
demiwolves
are
clept
all
by
the
name
of
dogs
the
valud
file
distinguishes
the
swift
the
slow
the
subtle
the
housekeeper
the
hunter
every
one
according
to
the
gift
which
bounteous
nature
hath
in
him
closd
whereby
he
does
receive
particular
addition
from
the
bill
that
writes
them
all
alike
and
so
of
men
now
if
you
have
a
station
in
the
file
not
i
the
worst
rank
of
manhood
say
it
and
i
will
put
that
business
in
your
bosoms
whose
execution
takes
your
enemy
off
grapples
you
to
the
heart
and
love
of
us
who
wear
our
health
but
sickly
in
his
life
which
in
his
death
were
perfect
i
am
one
my
liege
whom
the
vile
blows
and
buffets
of
the
world
have
so
incensd
that
i
am
reckless
what
i
do
to
spite
the
world
and
i
another
so
weary
with
disasters
tuggd
with
fortune
that
i
would
set
my
life
on
any
chance
to
mend
it
or
be
rid
on
t
both
of
you
know
banquo
was
your
enemy
true
my
lord
so
is
he
mine
and
in
such
bloody
distance
that
every
minute
of
his
being
thrusts
against
my
nearst
of
life
and
though
i
could
with
barefacd
power
sweep
him
from
my
sight
and
bid
my
will
avouch
it
yet
i
must
not
for
certain
friends
that
are
both
his
and
mine
whose
loves
i
may
not
drop
but
wail
his
fall
whom
i
myself
struck
down
and
thence
it
is
that
i
to
your
assistance
do
make
love
masking
the
business
from
the
common
eye
for
sundry
weighty
reasons
we
shall
my
lord
perform
what
you
command
us

our
lives
your
spirits

through
you

spent
where
our
desire
is
got
without
content
tis
safer
to
be
that
which
we
destroy
than
by
destruction
dwell
in
doubtful
joy
how
now
my
lord
why
do
you
keep
alone
of
sorriest
fancies
your
companions
making
using
those
thoughts
which
should
indeed
have
died
with
them
they
think
on
things
without
all
remedy
should
be
without
regard
whats
done
is
done
we
have
scotchd
the
snake
not
killd
it
shell
close
and
be
herself
whilst
our
poor
malice
remains
in
danger
of
her
former
tooth
but
let
the
frame
of
things
disjoint
both
the
worlds
suffer
ere
we
will
eat
our
meal
in
fear
and
sleep
in
the
affliction
of
these
terrible
dreams
that
shake
us
nightly
better
be
with
the
dead
whom
we
to
gain
our
peace
have
sent
to
peace
than
on
the
torture
of
the
mind
to
lie
in
restless
ecstasy
duncan
is
in
his
grave
after
lifes
fitful
fever
he
sleeps
well
treason
has
done
his
worst
nor
steel
nor
poison
malice
domestic
foreign
levy
nothing
can
touch
him
further
come
on
gentle
my
lord
sleek
oer
your
rugged
looks
be
bright
and
jovial
among
your
guests
tonight
so
shall
i
love
and
so
i
pray
be
you
let
your
remembrance
apply
to
banquo
present
him
eminence
both
with
eye
and
tongue
unsafe
the
while
that
we
must
lave
our
honours
in
these
flattering
streams
and
make
our
faces
vizards
to
our
hearts
disguising
what
they
are
you
must
leave
this
o
full
of
scorpions
is
my
mind
dear
wife
thou
knowst
that
banquo
and
his
fleance
lives
but
in
them
natures
copys
not
eterne
theres
comfort
yet
they
are
assailable
then
be
thou
jocund
ere
the
bat
hath
flown
his
cloisterd
flight
ere
to
black
hecates
summons
the
shardborne
beetle
with
his
drowsy
hums
hath
rung
nights
yawning
peal
there
shall
be
done
a
deed
of
dreadful
note
whats
to
be
done
be
innocent
of
the
knowledge
dearest
chuck
till
thou
applaud
the
deed
come
seeling
night
scarf
up
the
tender
eye
of
pitiful
day
and
with
thy
bloody
and
invisible
hand
cancel
and
tear
to
pieces
that
great
bond
which
keeps
me
pale
light
thickens
and
the
crow
makes
wing
to
the
rooky
wood
good
things
of
day
begin
to
droop
and
drowse
whiles
nights
black
agents
to
their
preys
do
rouse
thou
marvellst
at
my
words
but
hold
thee
still
things
bad
begun
make
strong
themselves
by
ill
so
prithee
go
with
me
but
who
did
bid
thee

with

our
mistrust

our
offices

momentary
upon
a
thought
he

again
be
well
if
much
you
note

you
shall
offend
him
and
extend
his
passion
feed
and
regard
him
not
are
you
a
man
ay
and
a
bold
one
that
dare
look
on
that
which
might
appal
the
devil
o
proper
stuff
this
is
the
very
painting
of
your
fear
this
is
the
airdrawn
dagger
which
you
said
led
you
to
duncan
o
these
flaws
and
starts
impostors
to
true
fear
would
well
become
a
womans
story
at
a
winters
fire
authorizd
by
her
grandam
shame
itself
why
do
you
make
such
faces
when
alls
done
you
look
but
on
a
stool
prithee
see
there
behold
look
lo
how
say
you
why
what
care
i
if
thou
canst
nod
speak
too
if
charnelhouses
and
our
graves
must
send
those
that
we
bury
back
our
monuments
shall
be
the
maws
of
kites
what
quite
unmannd
in
folly
if
i
stand
here
i
saw
him
fie
for
shame
blood
hath
been
shed
ere
now
i
the
olden
time
ere
human
statute
purgd
the
gentle
weal
ay
and
since
too
murders
have
been
performd
too
terrible
for
the
ear
the
times
have
been
that
when
the
brains
were
out
the
man
would
die
and
there
an
end
but
now
they
rise
again
with
twenty
mortal
murders
on
their
crowns
and
push
us
from
our
stools
this
is
more
strange
than
such
a
murder
is
my
worthy
lord
your
noble
friends
do
lack
you
i
do
forget
do
not
muse
at
me
my
most
worthy
friends
i
have
a
strange
infirmity
which
is
nothing
to
those
that
know
me
come
love
and
health
to
all
then
ill
sit
down
give
me
some
wine
fill
full
i
drink
to
the
general
joy
of
the
whole
table
and
to
our
dear
friend
banquo
whom
we
miss
would
he
were
here
to
all
and
him
we
thirst
and
all
to
all
our
duties
and
the
pledge
avaunt
and
quit
my
sight
let
the
earth
hide
thee
thy
bones
are
marrowless
thy
blood
is
cold
thou
hast
no
speculation
in
those
eyes
which
thou
dost
glare
with
think
of
this
good
peers
but
as
a
thing
of
custom
tis
no
other
only
it
spoils
the
pleasure
of
the
time
what
man
dare
i
dare
approach
thou
like
the
rugged
russian
bear
the
armd
rhinoceros
or
the
hyrcan
tiger
take
any
shape
but
that
and
my
firm
nerves
shall
never
tremble
or
be
alive
again
and
dare
me
to
the
desart
with
thy
sword
if
trembling
i
inhabit
then
protest
me
the
baby
of
a
girl
hence
horrible
shadow
unreal
mockery
hence
why
so
being
gone
i
am
a
man
again
pray
you
sit
still
you
have
displacd
the
mirth
broke
the
good
meeting
with
most
admird
disorder
can
such
things
be
and
overcome
us
like
a
summers
cloud
without
our
special
wonder
you
make
me
strange
even
to
the
disposition
that
i
owe
when
now
i
think
you
can
behold
such
sights
and
keep
the
natural
ruby
of
your
cheeks
when
mine
are
blanchd
with
fear
what
sights
my
lord
i
pray
you
speak
not
he
grows
worse
and
worse
question
enrages
him
at
once
goodnight
stand
not
upon
the
order
of
your
going
but
go
at
once
goodnight
and
better
health

his
majesty

kind
goodnight

by
maggotpies
and
choughs
and
rooks
brought
forth
the
secretst
man
of
blood

the
night
almost
at
odds
with
morning
which

which
how
sayst

in
so
far
that

tedious
as

things

in

must
be
acted
ere
they
may
be
scannd

why
how
now
hecate
you

angerly

i
not
reason

you
are
saucy
and
overbold
how
did
you
dare
to
trade
and
traffic
with
macbeth
in
riddles
and
affairs
of
death
and
i
the
mistress
of
your
charms
the
close
contriver
of
all
harms
was
never
calld
to
bear
my
part
or
show
the
glory
of
our
art
and
which
is
worse
all
you
have
done
hath
been
but
for
a
wayward
son
spiteful
and
wrathful
who
as
others
do
loves
for
his
own
ends
not
for
you
but
make
amends

get
you
gone

dismal
and
a
fatal
end

business

upon
the
corner
of
the
moon
there
hangs
a
vaporous
drop
profound
ill
catch
it
ere
it
come
to
ground
and
that
distilld
by
magic
sleights
shall
raise
such
artificial
sprites
as
by
the
strength
of
their
illusion
shall
draw
him
on
to
his
confusion
he
shall
spurn
fate
scorn
death
and
bear
his
hopes
bove
wisdom
grace
and
fear
and
you
all
know
security
is
mortals
chiefest
enemy

i

been
strangely
borne
the
gracious
duncan
was
pitied
of
macbeth
marry
he
was
dead
and
the
rightvaliant
banquo
walkd
too
late
whom
you
may
say
if
t
please
you
fleance
killd
for
fleance
fled
men
must
not
walk
too
late
who
cannot
want
the
thought
how
monstrous
it
was
for
malcolm
and
for
donalbain
to
kill
their
gracious
father
damned
fact
how
it
did
grieve
macbeth
did
he
not
straight
in
pious
rage
the
two
delinquents
tear
that
were
the
slaves
of
drink
and
thralls
of
sleep
was
not
that
nobly
done
ay
and
wisely
too
for
twould
have
angerd
any
heart
alive
to
hear
the
men
deny
t
so
that
i
say
he
has
borne
all
things
well
and
i
do
think
that
had
he
duncans
sons
under
his
key
as
an
t
please
heaven
he
shall
not
they
should
find
what
twere
to
kill
a
father
so
should
fleance
but
peace
for
from
broad
words
and
cause

faild
his
presence
at
the
tyrants
feast
i
hear
macduff
lives
in
disgrace
sir
can
you
tell
where
he
bestows
himself
the
son
of
duncan
from
whom
this
tyrant
holds
the
due
of
birth
lives
in
the
english
court
and
is
receivd
of
the
most
pious
edward
with
such
grace
that
the
malevolence
of
fortune
nothing
takes
from
his
high
respect
thither
macduff
is
gone
to
pray
the
holy
king
upon
his
aid
to
wake
northumberland
and
warlike
siward
that
by
the
help
of
these
with
him
above
to
ratify
the
work
we
may
again
give
to
our
tables
meat
sleep
to
our
nights
free
from
our
feasts
and
banquets
bloody
knives
do
faithful
homage
and
receive
free
honours
all
which
we
pine
for
now
and
this
report
hath
so
exasperate
the
king
that
he
prepares
for
some
attempt
at
war
sent
he
to
macduff
he
did
and
with
an
absolute
sir
not
i
the
cloudy
messenger
turns
me
his
back
and
hums
as
who
should
say
youll
rue
the
time
that
clogs
me
with
this
answer
and
that
well
might
advise
him
to
a
caution
to
hold
what
distance
his
wisdom
can
provide
some
holy
angel
fly
to
the
court
of
england
and
unfold
his
message
ere
he
come
that
a
swift
blessing
may
soon
return
to
this
our
suffering
country
under
a
hand
accursd

go
with

from
this
moment
the
very
firstlings
of
my
heart
shall

my
thoughts
with
acts
be

thought
and
done
the
castle
of
macduff
i
will
surprise
seize
upon
fife
give
to
the
edge
of
the
sword
his
wife
his
babes
and
all
unfortunate
souls
that
trace
him
in
his
line
no
boasting
like
a
fool
this
deed
ill
do
before
this
purpose
cool
but
no
moresights
where
are
these
gentlemen
come
bring
me
where
they
are
what
had
he
done
to
make
him
fly
the
land
you
must
have
patience
madam
he
had
none
his
flight
was
madness
when
our
actions
do
not
our
fears
do
make
us
traitors
you
know
not
whether
it
was
his
wisdom
or
his
fear
wisdom
to
leave
his
wife
to
leave
his
babes
his
mansion
and
his
titles
in
a
place
from
whence
himself
does
fly
he
loves
us
not
he
wants
the
natural
touch
for
the
poor
wren
the
most
diminutive
of
birds
will
fight
her
young
ones
in
her
nest
against
the
owl
all
is
the
fear
and
nothing
is
the
love
as
little
is
the
wisdom
where
the
flight
so
runs
against
all
reason
my
dearest
coz
i
pray
you
school
yourself
but
for
your
husband
he
is
noble
wise
judicious
and
best
knows
the
fits
o
the
season
i
dare
not
speak
much
further
but
cruel
are
the
times
when
we
are
traitors
and
do
not
know
ourselves
when
we
hold
rumour
from
what
we
fear
yet
know
not
what
we
fear
but
float
upon
a
wild
and
violent
sea
each
way
and
move
i
take
my
leave
of
you
shall
not
be
long
but
ill
be
here
again
things
at
the
worst
will
cease
or
else
climb
upward
to
what
they
were
before
my
pretty
cousin
blessing
upon
you
fatherd
he
is
and
yet
hes
fatherless
i
am
so

be
my
disgrace
and
your
discomfort

my
leave
at
once
sirrah

and
what
will
you
do
now

will
you
live
as

and
flies
with
what
i
get
i
mean
and
so
do
they
poor
bird
thoudst
never
fear
the
net
nor
lime
the
pitfall
nor
the
gin
why
should
i
mother
poor
birds
they
are
not
set
for
my
father
is
not
dead
for
all
your
saying
yes
he
is
dead
how
wilt
thou
do
for
a
father
nay
how
will
you
do
for
a
husband
why
i
can
buy
me
twenty
at
any
market
then
youll
buy
em
to
sell
again
thou
speakst
with
all
thy
wit
and
yet
i
faith
with
wit
enough
for
thee
was
my
father
a
traitor
mother
ay
that
he
was
what
is
a
traitor
why
one
that
swears
and
lies
and
be
all
traitors
that
do
so
every
one
that
does
so
is
a
traitor
and
must
be
hanged
and
must
they
all
be
hanged
that
swear
and
lie
every
one
who
must
hang
them
why
the
honest
men
then
the
liars
and
swearers
are
fools
for
there
are
liars
and
swearers
enow
to
beat
the
honest

now
god
help
thee
poor
monkey
but
how
wilt
thou
do
for
a
father
if
he
were
dead
youd
weep
for
him
if
you
would
not
it
were
a
good
sign
that
i
should
quickly
have
a
new
father
poor
prattler
how
thou
talkst
bless
you
fair
dame
i
am
not
to
you
known
though
in
your
state
of
honour
i
am
perfect
i
doubt
some
danger
does
approach
you
nearly
if
you
will
take
a
homely
mans
advice
be
not
found
here
hence
with
your
little
ones
to
fright
you
thus
methinks
i
am
too
savage
to
do
worse
to
you
were
fell
cruelty
which
is
too
nigh
your
person
heaven
preserve
you
i
dare
abide
no
longer
whither
should
i
fly
i
have
done
no
harm
but
i
remember
now
i
am
in
this
earthly
world
where
to
do
harm
is
often
laudable
to
do
good
sometime
accounted
dangerous
folly
why
then
alas
do
i
put
up
that
womanly
defence
to
say
i
have
done
no
harm
what
are
these
faces
where
is
your
husband
i
hope
in
no
place
so
unsanctified
where
such
as
thou
mayst
find
him
hes
a
traitor
thou
liest
thou
shaghaird
villain
what
you
egg
young
fry
of
treachery
he
has
killed
me
mother
run
away
i
pray
you
let
us
seek
out
some
desolate
shade
and
there
weep
our
sad
bosoms
empty
let
us
rather
hold
fast
the
mortal
sword
and
like
good
men
bestride
our
downfalln
birthdom
each
new
morn
new
widowshowl
new
orphans
cry
new
sorrows
strike
heaven
on
the
face
that
it
resounds
as
if
it
felt
with
scotland
and
yelld
out
like
syllable
of
dolour
what
i
believe
ill
wail
what
know
believe
and
what
i
can
redress
as
i
shall
find
the
time
to
friend
i
will
what
you
have
spoke
it
may
be
so
perchance
this
tyrant
whosesole
name
blisters
our
tongues
was
once
thought
honest
you
have
lovd
him
well
he
hath
not
touchd
you
yet
i
am
young
but
something
you
may
deserve
of
him
through
me
and
wisdom
to
offer
up
a
weak
poor
innocent
lamb
to
appease
an
angry
god
i
am
not
treacherous
but
macbeth
is
a
good
and
virtuous
nature
may
recoil
in
an
imperial
charge
but
i
shall
crave
your
pardon
that
which
you
are
my
thoughts
cannot
transpose
angels
are
bright
still
though
the
brightest
fell
though
all
things
foul
would
wear
the
brows
of
grace
yet
grace
must
still
look
so
i
have
lost
my
hopes
perchance
even
there
where
i
did
find
my
doubts
why
in
that
rawness
left
you
wife
and
child
those
precious
motives
those
strong
knots
of
love
without
leavetaking
i
pray
you
let
not
my
jealousies
be
your
dishonours
but
mine
own
safeties
you
may
be
rightly
just
whatever
i
shall
think
bleed
bleed
poor
country
great
tyranny
lay
thou
thy
basis
sure
for
goodness
dares
not
check
thee
wear
thou
thy
wrongs
the
title
is
affeerd
fare
thee
well
lord
i
would
not
be
the
villain
that
thou
thinkst
for
the
whole
space
thats
in
the
tyrants
grasp
and
the
rich
east
to
boot
be
not
offended
i
speak
not
as
in
absolute
fear
of
you
i
think
our
country
sinks
beneath
the
yoke
it
weeps
it
bleeds
and
each
new
day
a
gash
is
added
to
her
wounds
i
think
withal
there
would
be
hands
uplifted
in
my
right
and
here
from
gracious
england
have
i
offer
of
goodly
thousands
but
for
all
this
when
i
shall
tread
upon
the
tyrants
head
or
wear
it
on
my
sword
yet
my
poor
country
shall
have
more
vices
than
it
had
before
more
suffer
and
more
sundry
ways
than
ever
by
him
that
shall
succeed
what
should
he
be
it
is
myself
i
mean
in
whom
i
know
all
the
particulars
of
vice
so
grafted
that
when
they
shall
be
opend
black
macbeth
will
seem
as
pure
as
snow
and
the
poor
state
esteem
him
as
a
lamb
being
compard
with
my
confineless
harms
not
in
the
legions
of
horrid
hell
can
come
a
devil
more
damnd
in
evils
to
top
macbeth
i
grant
him
bloody
luxurious
avaricious
false
deceitful
sudden
malicious
smacking
of
every
sin
that
has
a
name
but
theres
no
bottom
none
in
my
voluptuousness
your
wives
your
daughters
your
matrons
and
your

could
not
fill
up
the
cistern
of
my
lust
and
my

better
macbeth
than
such
an
one
to

boundless
intemperance
in

a
tyranny
it
hath
been
th
untimely
emptying
of
the

kings
but
fear
not

to
take
upon
you
what
is

you
may

your

in

there
cannot

in
you
to

so
many
as

dedicate
themselves
finding
it
so
inclind
with

there
grows
in
my
most
illcomposd
affection
such
a
stanchless
avarice
that
were

should
cut
off
the
nobles
for
their

and
this

that
i
should
forge

this

devilish
macbeth
by
many
of
these
trains
hath
sought
to
win
me
into
his
power
and
modest
wisdom
plucks
me
from
overcredulous
haste
but
god
above
deal
between
thee
and
me
for
even
now
i
put
myself
to
thy
direction
and
unspeak
mine
own
detraction
here
abjure
the
taints
and
blames
i
laid
upon
myself
for
strangers
to
my
nature
i
am
yet
unknown
to
woman
never
was
forsworn
scarcely
have
coveted
what
was
mine
own
at
no
time
broke
my
faith
would
not
betray
the
devil
to
his
fellow
and
delight
no
less
in
truth
than
life
my
first
false
speaking
was
this
upon
myself
what
i
am
truly
is
thine
and
my
poor
countrys
to
command
whither
indeed
before
thy
hereapproach
old
siward
with
ten
thousand
warlike
men
already
at
a
point
was
setting
forth
now
well
together
and
the
chance
of
goodness
be
like
our
warranted
quarrel
why
are
you
silent
such
welcome
and
unwelcome
things
at
once
tis
hard
to
reconcile
well
more
anon
comes
the
king
forth
i
pray
you
ay
sir
there
are
a
crew
of
wretched
souls
that
stay
his
cure
their
malady
convinces
the
great
assay
of
art
but
at
his
touch
such
sanctity
hath
heaven
given
his
hand
they
presently
amend
i
thank
you
doctor
whats
the
disease
he
means

calld
the
evil
a
most
miraculous
work
in
this
good
king
which
often
since
my
hereremain
in
england
i
have
seen
him
do
how
he
solicits
heaven
himself
best
knows
but
strangelyvisited
people
all
swoln
and
ulcerous
pitiful
to
the
eye
the
mere
despair
of
surgery
he
cures
hanging
a
golden
stamp
about
their
necks
put
on
with
holy
prayers
and
tis
spoken
to
the
succeeding
royalty
he
leaves
the
healing
benediction
with
this
strange
virtue
he
hath
a
heavenly
gift
of
prophecy
and
sundry
blessings
hang
about
his
throne
that
speak
him
full
of
grace

countryman
but
yet
i

amen
stands
scotland
where
it
did
alas
poor
country
almost
afraid
to
know
itself
it
cannot
be
calld
our
mother
but
our
grave
where
nothing
but
who
knows
nothing
is
once
seen
to
smile
where
sighs
and
groans
and
shrieks
that
rent
the
air
are
made
not
markd
where
violent
sorrow
seems
a
modern
ecstasy
the
dead
mans
knell
is
there
scarce
askd
for
who
and
good
mens
lives
expire
before
the
flowers
in
their
caps
dying
or
ere
they
sicken
o
relation
too
nice
and
yet
too
true
whats
the
newest
grief
that
of
an
hours
age
doth
hiss
the
speaker
each
minute
teems
a
new
one
how
does
my
wife
why
well
and
all
my
children
well
too
the
tyrant
has
not
batterd
at
their
peace

were
well
at
peace
when
i
did
leave
em
be
not
a
niggard
of
your
speech
how
goes
t
when
i
came
hither
to
transport
the
tidings
which
i
have
heavily
borne
there
ran
a
rumour
of
many
worthy
fellows
that
were
out
which
was
to
my
belief
witnessd
the
rather
for
that
i
saw
the
tyrants
power
afoot
now
is
the
time
of
help
your
eye
in
scotland
would
create
soldiers
make
our
women
fight
to
doff
their
dire
distresses
be
t
their
comfort
we
are
coming
thither
gracious
england
hath
lent
us
good
siward
and
ten
thousand
men
an
older
and
a
better
soldier
none
that
christendom
gives
out
would
i
could
answer
this
comfort
with
the
like
but
i
have
words
that
would
be
howld
out
in
the
desert
air
where
hearing
should
not
latch
them
what
concern
they
the
general
cause
or
is
it
a
feegrief
due
to
some
single
breast
no
mind
thats
honest
but
in
it
shares
some
woe
though
the
main
part
pertains
to
you
alone
if
it
be
mine
keep
it
not
from
me
quickly
let
me
have
it
let
not
your
ears
despise
my
tongue
for
ever
which
shall
possess
them
with
the
heaviest
sound
that
ever
yet
they
heard
hum
i
guess
at
it
your
castle
is
surprisd
your
wife
and
babes
savagely
slaughterd
to
relate
the
manner
were
on
the
quarry
of
these
murderd
deer
to
add
the
death
of
you
merciful
heaven
what
man
neer
pull
your
hat
upon
your
brows
give
sorrow
words
the
grief
that
does
not
speak
whispers
the
oerfraught
heart
and
bids
it
break
my
children
too
wife
children
servants
all
that
could
be
found
and
i
must
be
from
thence
my
wife
killd
too

make
us
medicine
of
our
great
revenge
to
cure
this
deadly
grief

no
children

my
pretty
ones
did
you
say
all
o
hellkite
all
what
all
my
pretty
chickens
and
their
dam
at
one
fell
swoop
dispute
it
like
a
man
i
shall
do
so
but
i
must
also
feel
it
as
a
man
i
cannot
but
remember
such
things
were
that
were
most
precious
to
me
did
heaven
look
on
and
would
not
take
their
part
sinful
macduff
they
were
all
struck
for
thee
naught
that
i
am
not
for
their
own
demerits
but
for
mine
fell
slaughter
on
their
souls
heaven
rest
them
now
be
this
the
whetstone
of
your
sword
let
grief
convert
to
anger
blunt
not
the
heart
enrage
it
o
i
could
play
the
woman
with
mine
eyes
and
braggart
with
my
tongue
but
gentle
heavens
cut
short
all
intermission
front
to
front
bring
thou
this
fiend
of
scotland
and
myself
within
my
swords
length
set
him
if
he
scape
heaven
forgive
him
too
this
tune
goes
manly
come
go
we
to
the
king
our
power
is
ready
our
lack
is
nothing
but
our
leave
macbeth
is
ripe
for
shaking
and
the
powers
above
put
on
their
instruments
receive
what
cheer
you
may
the
night
is
long
that
never
finds
the
day
i
have
two
nights
watched
with
you
but
can
perceive
no
truth
in
your
report
when
was
it
she
last
walked
since
his
majesty
went
into
the
field
i
have
seen
her
rise
from
her
bed
throw
her
nightgown
upon
her
unlock
her
closet
take
forth
paper
fold
it
write
upon
t
read
it
afterwards
seal
it
and
again
return
to
bed
yet
all
this
while
in
a
most
fast
sleep
a
great
perturbation
in
nature
to
receive
at
once
the
benefit
of
sleep
and
do
the
effects
of
watching
in
this
slumbery
agitation
besides
her
walking
and
other
actual
performances
what
at
any
time
have
you
heard
her
say
that
sir
which
i
will
not
report
after
her
you
may
to
me
and
tis
most
meet
you
should
neither
to
you
nor
any
one
having
no
witness
to
confirm
my
speech
lo
you
here
she
comes
this
is
her
very
guise
and
upon
my
life
fast
asleep
observe
her
stand
close
how
came
she
by
that
light
why
it
stood
by
her
she
has
light
by
her
continually
tis
her
command
you
see
her
eyes
are
open
ay
but
their
sense
is
shut
what
is
it
she
does
now
look
how
she
rubs
her
hands
it
is
an
accustomed
action
with
her
to
seem
thus
washing
her
hands
i
have
known
her
to
continue
in
this
a
quarter
of
an
hour
yet
heres
a
spot
hark
she
speaks
i
will
set
down
what
comes
from
her
to
satisfy
my
remembrance

more
strongly
out
damned
spot

i
say
one
two
why
then
tis
time
to
dot
hell

murky
fie

lord
fie
a
soldier
and
afeard
what
need

fear
who
knows
it
when
none
can
call
our
power
to
account
yet
who
would
have
thought
the
old
man
to
have
had
so
much
blood
in
him
do
you
mark
that
the
thane
of
fife
had
a
wife
where
is
she
now

these
hands
neer
be
clean

she
should
not
i
am
sure
of
that
heaven
knows
what
she
has
known
heres
the
smell
of
the
blood
still
all
the
perfumes
of
arabia
will
not
sweeten
this
little
hand
oh
oh
oh
what
a
sigh
is
there
the
heart
is
sorely
charged
i
would
not
have
such
a
heart
in
my
bosom
for
the
dignity
of
the
whole
body
well

pray
god

be
sir
this
disease
is
beyond
my
practice

good
macduff

he
strongly
fortifies
some

hes
mad
others
that
lesser

cannot
buckle
his
distemperd
cause
within

his
secret
murders
sticking
on
his
hands
now
minutely

faithbreach
those

commands
move
only
in

nothing
in

now
does
he
feel
his
title
hang
loose
about
him
like
a
giants
robe
upon
a
dwarfish
thief
who
then
shall
blame
his
pesterd
senses
to
recoil
and
start
when
all
that

condemn
itself

of
that

out
the

perilous
stuff

disease
and
purge
it
to
a
sound
and
pristine
health
i
would
applaud
thee
to
the
very
echo
that
should
applaud
again
pull
t
off
i
say
what
rhubarb
senna
or
what
purgative
drug
would
scour
these
english
hence
hearst
thou
of
them
ay
my
good
lord
your
royal
preparation
makes
us
hear
something
bring
it
after
me
i
will
not
be
afraid
of
death
and
bane
till
birnam
forest
come
to
dunsinane
were
i
from
dunsinane
away
and
clear
profit
again
should
hardly
draw
me
here
cousins
i
hope
the
days
are
near
at
hand
that
chambers
will
be
safe
we
doubt
it
nothing
what
wood
is
this
before
us
the
wood
of
birnam
let
every
soldier
hew
him
down
a
bough
and
bear
t
before
him
thereby
shall
we
shadow
the
numbers
of
our
host
and
make
discovery
err
in
report
of
us
it
shall
be
done
we
learn
no
other
but
the
confident
tyrant
keeps
still
in
dunsinane
and
will
endure
our
setting
down
before
t
tis
his
main
hope
for
where
there
is
advantage
to
be
given
both
more
and
less
have
given
him
the
revolt
and
none
serve
with
him
but
constrained
things
whose
hearts
are
absent
too
let
our
just
censures
attend
the
true
event
and
put
we
on
industrious
soldiership
the
time
approaches
that
will
with
due
decision
make
us
know
what
we
shall
say
we
have
and
what
we
owe
thoughts
speculative
their
unsure
hopes
relate
but
certain
issue
strokes
must
arbitrate
towards
which
advance
the
war
hang
out
our
banners
on
the
outward
walls
the
cry
is
still
they
come
our
castles
strength
will
laugh
a
siege
to
scorn
here
let
them
lie
till
famine
and
the
ague
eat
them
up
were
they
not
forcd
with
those
that
should
be
ours
we
might
have
met
them
dareful
beard
to
beard
and
beat
them
backward
home
what
is
that
noise
it
is
the
cry
of
women
my
good
lord
i
have
almost
forgot
the
taste
of
fears
the
time
has
been
my
senses
would
have
coold
to
hear
a
nightshriek
and
my
fell
of
hair
would
at
a
dismal
treatise
rouse
and
stir
as
life
were
in
t
i
have
suppd
full
with
horrors
direness
familiar
to
my
slaughterous
thoughts
cannot
once
start
me
wherefore
was
that
cry
the
queen
my
lord
is
dead
she
should
have
died
hereafter
there
would
have
been
a
time
for
such
a
word
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
creeps
in
this
petty
pace
from
day
to
day
to
the
last
syllable
of
recorded
time
and
all
our
yesterdays
have
lighted
fools
the
way
to
dusty
death
out
out
brief
candle
lifes
but
a
walking
shadow
a
poor
player
that
struts
and
frets
his
hour
upon
the
stage
and
then
is
heard
no
more
it
is
a
tale
told
by
an
idiot
full
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
thou
comst
to
use
thy
tongue
thy
story
quickly
gracious
my
lord
i
should
report
that
which
i
say
i
saw
but
know
not
how
to
do
it
well
say
sir
as
i
did
stand
my
watch
upon
the
hill
i
lookd
towards
birnam
and
anon
methought
the
wood
began
to
move
liar
and
slave
let
me
endure
your
wrath
ift
be
not
so
within
this
three
mile
may
you
see
it
coming
i
say
a
moving
grove
if
thou
speakst
false
upon
the
next
tree
shalt
thou
hang
alive
till
famine
cling
thee
if
thy
speech
be
sooth
i
care
not
if
thou
dost
for
me
as
much
i
pull
in
resolution
and
begin
to
doubt
the
equivocation
of
the
fiend
that
lies
like
truth
fear
not
till
birnam
wood
do
come
to
dunsinane
and
now
a
wood
comes
toward
dunsinane
arm
arm
and
out
if
this
which
he
avouches
does
appear
there
is
nor
flying
hence
nor
tarrying
here
i
gin
to
be
aweary
of
the
sun
and
wish
the
estate
o
the
world

here
may
you
see
the
tyrant
i
will
not
yield
to
kiss
the
ground
before
young
malcolms
feet
and
to
be
baited
with
the
rabbles
curse
though

and
thou

and
damnd
be

that
first
cries
hold
enough
i
would
the
friends

were
safe
arrivd
some

paid
a
soldiers
debt

but
till
he
was
a
man
the
which
no
sooner
had
his
prowess
confirmd
in
the
unshrinking
station
where
he
fought
but
like
a
man
he
died
then
he
is
dead
ay
and
brought
off
the
field
your
cause
of
sorrow
must
not
be
measurd
by
his
worth
for
then
it
hath
no
end
had
he
his
hurts
before
ay
on
the
front
why
then
gods
soldier
be
he
had
i
as
many
sons
as
i
have
hairs
i
would
not
wish
them
to
a
fairer
death
and
so
his
knell
is
knolld
hes
worth
more
sorrow
and
that
ill
spend
for
him
hes
worth
no
more
they
say
he
parted
well
and
paid
his
score
and
so
god
be
with
him
here
comes
newer
comfort

aloud
with
mine
hail

scotland
hail

not
spend
a
large
expense
of
time

and
make
us
even
with
you
my
thanes
and
kinsmen
henceforth

first
that
ever
scotland
in
such
an
honour
namd
whats
more
to
do
which
would
be
planted
newly
with
the
time
as
calling
home
our
exild
friends
abroad
that
fled
the
snares
of
watchful
tyranny
producing
forth
the
cruel
ministers
of
this
dead
butcher
and
his
fiendlike
queen
who
as
tis
thought
by
self
and
violent
hands
took
off
her
life
this
and
what
needful
else
that
calls
upon
us
by
the
grace
of
grace
we
will
perform
in
measure
time
and
place
so
thanks
to
all
at
once
and
to
each
one
whom
we
invite
to
see
us
crownd
at
scone
othello
the
moor
of
venice
tush
never
tell
me
i
take
it
much
unkindly
that
thou
iago
who
hast
had
my
purse
as
if
the
strings
were
thine
shouldst
know
of
this
sblood
but
you
will
not
hear
me
if
ever
i
did
dream
of
such
a
matter
abhor
me
thou
toldst
me
thou
didst
hold
him
in
thy
hate
despise
me
if
i
do
not
three
great
ones
of
the
city
in
personal
suit
to
make
me
his
lieutenant
offcappd
to
him
and
by
the
faith
of
man
i
know
my
price
i
am
worth
no
worse
a
place
but
he
as
loving
his
own
pride
and
purposes
evades
them
with
a
bombast
circumstance
horribly
stuffd
with
epithets
of
war
and
in
conclusion
nonsuits
my
mediators
for
certes
says
he
i
have
already
chose
my
officer
and
what
was
he
forsooth
a
great
arithmetician
one
michael
cassio
a
florentine
a
fellow
almost
damnd
in
a
fair
wife
that
never
set
a
squadron
in
the
field
nor
the
division
of
a
battle
knows
more
than
a
spinster
unless
the
bookish
theoric
wherein
the
toged
consuls
can
propose
as
masterly
as
he
mere
prattle
without
practice
is
all
his
soldiership
but
he
sir
had
the
election
and
i
of
whom
his
eyes
had
seen
the
proof
at
rhodes
at
cyprus
and
on
other
grounds
christian
and
heathen
must
be
beleed
and
calmd
by
debitor
and
creditor
this
counter
caster
he
in
good
time
must
his
lieutenant
be
and
i
god
bless
the
mark
his
moorships
ancient
by
heaven
i
rather
would
have
been
his
hangman
why
theres
no
remedy
tis
the
curse
of
the
service
preferment
goes
by
letter
and
affection
not
by
the
old
gradation
where
each
second
stood
heir
to
the
first
now
sir
be
judge
yourself
wher
i
in
any
just
term
am
affind
to
love
the
moor
i
would
not
follow
him
then
o
sir
content
you
i
follow
him
to
serve
my
turn
upon
him
we
cannot
all
be
masters
nor
all
masters
cannot
be
truly
followd
you
shall
mark
many
a
duteous
and
kneecrooking
knave
that
doting
on
his
own
obsequious
bondage
wears
out
his
time
much
like
his
masters
ass
for
nought
but
provender
and
when
hes
old
cashierd
whip
me
such
honest
knaves
others
there
are
who
trimmd
in
forms
and
visages
of
duty
keep
yet
their
hearts
attending
on
themselves
and
throwing
but
shows
of
service
on
their
lords
do
well
thrive
by
them
and
when
they
have
lind
their
coats
do
themselves
homage
these
fellows
have
some
soul
and
such
a
one
do
i
profess
myself
for
sir
it
is
as
sure
as
you
are
roderigo
were
i
the
moor
i
would
not
be
iago
in
following
him
i
follow
but
myself
heaven
is
my
judge
not
i
for
love
and
duty
but
seeming
so
for
my
peculiar
end
for
when
my
outward
action
doth
demonstrate
the
native
act
and
figure
of
my
heart
in
compliment
extern
tis
not
long
after
but
i
will
wear
my
heart
upon
my
sleeve
for
daws
to
peck

though

him
with
flies
though
that
his

yet
throw
such
changes
of
vexation
on

as
it
may
lose
some
colour
here
is
her

one
of
those
that

service
and
you

are
ruffians

with
a
barbary
horse

one
sir
that

to
tell
you
your
daughter
and
the
moor

now
making
the
beast
with
two
backs
thou
art
a
villain
you
are
a
senator
this
thou
shalt
answer
i
know
thee
roderigo
sir
i
will
answer
any
thing
but
i
beseech
you
if
t
be
your
pleasure
and
most
wise
consent
as
partly
i
find
it
is
that
your
fair
daughter
at
this
oddeven
and
dullwatch
o
the
night
transported
with
no
worse
nor
better
guard
but
with
a
knave
of
common
hire
a
gondolier
to
the
gross
clasps
of
a
lascivious
moor
if
this
be
known
to
you
and
your
allowance
we
then
have
done
you
bold
and
saucy
wrongs
but
if
you
know
not
this
my
manners
tell
me
we
have
your
wrong
rebuke
do
not
believe
that
from
the
sense
of
all
civility
i
thus
would
play
and
trifle
with
your
reverence
your
daughter
if
you
have
not
given
her
leave
i
say
again
hath
made
a
gross
revolt
tying
her
duty
beauty
wit
and
fortunes
in
an
extravagant
and
wheeling
stranger
of
here
and
every
where
straight
satisfy
yourself
if
she
be
in
her
chamber
or
your
house
let
loose
on
me
the
justice
of
the
state
for
thus
deluding
you
strike
on
the
tinder
ho
give
me
a
taper
call
up
all
my
people
this
accident
is
not
unlike
my
dream
belief
of
it
oppresses
me
already
light
i
say
light
farewell
for
i
must
leave
you
it
seems
not
meet
nor
wholesome
to
my
place
to
be
producd
as
if
i
stay
i
shall
against
the
moor
for
i
do
know
the
state
however
this
may
gall
him
with
some
check
cannot
with
safety
cast
him
for
hes
embarkd
with
such
loud
reason
to
the
cyprus
wars
which
even
now
stand
in
act
that
for
their
souls
another
of
his
fathom
they
have
none
to
lead
their
business
in
which
regard
though
i
do
hate
him
as
i
do
hellpains
yet
for
necessity
of
present
life
i
must
show
out
a
flag
and
sign
of
love
which
is
indeed
but
sign
that
you
shall
surely
find
him
lead
to
the
sagittary
the
raised
search
and
there
will
i
be
with
him
so
farewell
it
is
too
true
an
evil
gone
she
is
and
whats
to
come
of
my
despised
time
is
nought
but
bitterness
now
roderigo
where
didst
thou
see
her
o
unhappy
girl
with
the
moor
sayst
thou
who
would
be
a
father
how
didst
thou
know
twas
she
o
she
deceives
me
past
thought
what
said
she
to
you
get
more
tapers
raise
all
my
kindred
are
they
married
think
you
truly
i
think
they
are
o
heaven
how
got
she
out
o
treason
of
the
blood
fathers
from
hence
trust
not
your
daughters
minds
by
what
you
see
them
act
are
there
not
charms
by
which
the
property
of
youth
and
maidhood
may
be
abusd
have
you
not
read
roderigo
of
some
such
thing
yes
sir
i
have
indeed
call
up
my
brother
o
that
you
had
had
her
some
one
way
some
another
do
you
know
where
we
may
apprehend
her
and
the
moor
i
think
i
can
discover
him
if
you
please
to
get
good
guard
and
go
along
with
me
pray
you
lead
on
at
every
house
ill
call
i
may
command
at
most
get
weapons
ho
and
raise
some
special
officers
of
night
on
good
roderigo
ill
deserve
your
pains
though
in
the
trade
of
war
i
have
slain
men
yet
do
i
hold
it
very
stuff
o
the
conscience
to
do
no
contrivd
murder
i
lack
iniquity
sometimes
to
do
me
service
nine
or
ten
times
i
had
thought
to
have
yerkd
him
here
under
the
ribs
tis
better
as
it
is
nay
but
he
prated
and
spoke
such
scurvy
and
provoking
terms
against
your
honour
that
with
the
little
godliness
i
have
i
did
full
hard
forbear
him
but
i
pray
sir
are
you
fast
married
be
assurd
of
this
that
the
magnifico
is
much
belovd
and
hath
in
his
effect
a
voice
potential
as
double
as
the
dukes
he
will
divorce
you
or
put
upon
you
what
restraint
and
grievance
the
law
with
all
his
might
to
enforce
it
on
will
give
him
cable
let
him
do
his
spite
my
services
which
i
have
done
the
signiory
shall
outtongue
his
complaints
tis
yet
to
know
which
when
i
know
that
boasting
is
an
honour
i
shall
promulgate
i
fetch
my
life
and
being
from
men
of
royal
siege
and
my
demerits
may
speak
unbonneted
to
as
proud
a

thou
hast
enchanted
her
for
ill
refer
me
to
all
things
of
sense
if

maid
so
tender
fair
and
happy
so
opposite
to
marriage
that
she
shunnd
the
wealthy
curled
darlings
of
our
nation
would
ever
have
to
incur
a
general
mock
run
from
her
guardage
to
the
sooty
bosom
of
such
a
thing
as
thou
to
fear
not
to
delight
judge
me
the
world
if
tis
not
gross
in
sense
that
thou
hast
practisd
on

foul
charms
abusd
her
delicate
youth
with
drugs
or
minerals
that
weaken
motion
ill
have
t
disputed
on
tis
probable
and
palpable
to
thinking
i
therefore
apprehend
and
do
attach
thee
for
an
abuser
of
the
world
a
practiser
of
arts
inhibited
and
out
of
warrant
lay
hold
upon
him
if
he
do
resist
subdue
him
at
his
peril
hold
your
hands
both
you
of
my
inclining
and
the
rest
were
it
my
cue
to
fight
i
should
have
known
it
without
a
prompter
where
will
you
that
i
go
to
answer
this
your
charge
to
prison
till
fit
time
of
law
and
course
of
direct
session
call
thee
to
answer
what
if
i
do
obey
how
may
the
duke
be
therewith
satisfied
whose
messengers
are
here
about
my
side
upon
some
present
business
of
the
state
to
bring
me
to
him
tis
true
most
worthy
signior
the
dukes
in
council
and
your
noble
self
i
am
sure
is
sent
for
how
the
duke
in
council
in
this
time
of
the
night
bring
him
away
mines
not
an
idle
cause
the
duke
himself
or
any
of
my
brothers
of
the
state
cannot
but
feel
this
wrong
as
twere
their
own
for
if
such
actions
may
have
passage
free
bondslaves
and
pagans
shall
our
statesmen
be
there
is
no
composition
in
these
news
that
gives
them
credit
indeed
they
are
disproportiond
my
letters
say
a
hundred
and
seven
galleys
and
mine
a
hundred
and
forty
and
mine
two
hundred
but
though
they
jump
not
on
a
just
account
as
in
these
cases
where
the
aim
reports
tis
oft
with
difference
yet
do
they
all
confirm
a
turkish
fleet
and
bearing
up
to
cyprus
nay
it
is
possible
enough
to
judgment
i
do
not
so
secure
me
in
the
error
but
the
main
article
i
do
approve
in
fearful
sense
what
ho
what
ho
what
ho
a
messenger
from
the
galleys
now
whats
the
business
the
turkish
preparation
makes
for
rhodes
so
was
i
bid
report
here
to
the
state
by
signior
angelo
how
say
you
by
this
change
this
cannot
be
by
no
assay
of
reason
tis
a
pageant
to
keep
us
in
false
gaze
when
we
consider
the
importancy
of
cyprus
to
the
turk
and
let
ourselves
again
but
understand
that
as
it
more
concerns
the
turk
than
rhodes
so
may
he
with
more
facile
question
bear
it
for
that
it
stands
not
in
such
warlike
brace
but
altogether
lacks
the
abilities
that
rhodes
is
dressd
in
if
we
make
thought
of
this
we
must
not
think
the
turk
is
so
unskilful
to
leave
that
latest
which
concerns
him
first
neglecting
an
attempt
of
ease
and
gain
to
wake
and
wage
a
danger
profitless
nay
in
all
confidence
hes
not
for
rhodes
here
is
more
news
the
ottomites
reverend
and
gracious
steering
with
due
course
toward
the
isle
of
rhodes
have
there
injointed
them
with
an
after
fleet
ay
so
i
thought
how
many
as
you
guess
of
thirty
sail
and
now
they
do
restem
their
backward
course
bearing
with
frank
appearance
their
purposes
toward
cyprus
signior
montano
your
trusty
and
most
valiant
servitor
with
his
free
duty
recommends
you
thus
and
prays
you
to
believe
him
tis
certain
then
for
cyprus
marcus
luccicos
is
not

you
against
the
general
enemy
ottoman
i
did
not
see
you
welcome
gentle
signior
we
lackd
your
counsel
and
your
help
tonight
so
did
i
yours
good
your
grace
pardon
me
neither
my
place
nor
aught
i
heard
of
business
hath
raisd
me
from
my
bed
nor
doth
the
general
care
take
hold
of
me
for
my
particular
grief
is
of
so
floodgate
and
oerbearing
nature
that
it
engluts
and
swallows
other
sorrows
and
it
is
still
itself
why
whats
the
matter
my
daughter
o
my
daughter
dead
dead
ay
to
me
she
is
abusd
stoln
from
me
and
corrupted
by
spells
and
medicines
bought
of
mountebanks
for
nature
so
preposterously
to
err
being
not
deficient
blind
or
lame
of
sense
sans
witchcraft
could
not
whoeer
he
be
that
in
this
foul
proceeding
hath
thus
beguild
your
daughter
of
herself
and
you
of
her
the
bloody
book
of
law
you
shall
yourself
read
in
the
bitter
letter
after
your
own
sense
yea
though
our
proper
son
stood
in
your
action
humbly
i
thank
your
grace
here
is
the
man
this
moor
whom
now
it
seems
your
special
mandate
for
the
state
affairs
hath
hither
brought
we
are
very
sorry
for
it
we
are
very
sorry
for
it
what
in
your
own
part
can
you
say
to
this
nothing
but
this
is
so
most
potent
grave
and
reverend
signiors
my
very
noble
and
approvd
good
masters
that
i
have
taen
away
this
old
mans
daughter
it
is
most
true
true
i
have
married
her
the
very
head
and
front
of
my
offending
hath
this
extent
no
more
rude
am
i
in
my
speech
and
little
blessd
with
the
soft
phrase
of
peace
for
since
these
arms
of
mine
had
seven
years
pith
till
now
some
nine
moons
wasted
they
have
usd
their
dearest
action
in
the
tented
field
and
little
of
this
great
world
can
i
speak
more
than
pertains
to
feats
of
broil
and
battle
and
therefore
little
shall
i
grace
my
cause
in
speaking
for
myself
yet
by
your
gracious
patience
i
will
a
round
unvarnishd
tale
deliver
of
my
whole
course
of
love
what
drugs
what
charms
what
conjuration
and
what
mighty
magic
for
such
proceeding
i
am
chargd
withal
i
won
his
daughter
a
maiden
never
bold
of
spirit
so
still
and
quiet
that
her
motion
blushd
at
herself
and
she
in
spite
of
nature
of
years
of
country
credit
every
thing
to
fall
in
love
with
what
she
feard
to
look
on
it
is
a
judgment
maimd
and
most
imperfect
that
will
confess
perfection
so
could
err
against
all
rules
of
nature
and
must
be
driven
to
find
out
practices
of
cunning
hell
why
this
should
be
i
therefore
vouch
again
that
with
some
mixtures
powerful
oer
the
blood
or
with
some
dram
conjurd
to
this
effect
he
wrought
upon
her
to
vouch
this
is
no
proof
without
more
certain
and
more
overt
test
than
these
thin
habits
and
poor
likelihoods
of
modern
seeming
do
prefer
against
him
but
othello
speak
did
you
by
indirect
and
forced
courses
subdue
and
poison
this
young
maids
affections
or
came
it
by
request
and
such
fair
question
as
soul
to
soul
affordeth
i
do
beseech
you
send
for
the
lady
to
the
sagittary
and
let
her
speak
of
me
before
her
father
if
you
do
find
me
foul
in
her
report
the
trust
the
office
i
do
hold
of
you
not
only
take
away
but
let
your
sentence
even
fall
upon
my
life
fetch
desdemona
hither
ancient
conduct
them
you
best
know
the
place
and
till
she
come
as
truly
as
to
heaven
i
do
confess
the
vices
of
my
blood
so
justly
to
your
grave
ears
ill
present
how
i
did
thrive
in
this
fair
ladys
love
and
she
in
mine
say
it
othello
her
father
lovd
me
oft
invited
me
still
questiond
me
the
story
of
my
life
from
year
to
year
the
battles
sieges
fortunes
that
i
have
passd
i
ran
it
through
even
from
my
boyish
days
to
the
very
moment
that
he
bade
me
tell
it
wherein
i
spake
of
most
disastrous
chances
of
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
of
hairbreadth
scapes
i
the
imminent
deadly
breach
of
being
taken
by
the
insolent
foe
and
sold
to
slavery
of
my
redemption
thence
and
portance
in
my
travels
history
wherein
of
antres
vast
and
desarts
idle
rough
quarries
rocks
and
hills
whose
heads
touch
heaven
it
was
my
hint
to
speak
such
was
the
process
and
of
the
cannibals
that
each
other
eat
the
anthropophagi
and
men
whose
heads
do
grow
beneath
their
shoulders
this
to
hear
would
desdemona
seriously
incline
but
still
the
houseaffairs
would
draw
her
thence
which
ever
as
she
could
with
haste
dispatch
shed
come
again
and
with
a
greedy
ear
devour
up
my
discourse
which
i
observing
took
once
a
pliant
hour
and
found
good
means
to
draw
from
her
a
prayer
of
earnest
heart
that
i
would
all
my
pilgrimage
dilate
whereof
by
parcels
she
had
something
heard
but
not
intentively
i
did
consent
and
often
did
beguile
her
of
her
tears
when
i
did
speak
of
some
distressful
stroke
that
my
youth
sufferd
my
story
being
done
she
gave
me
for
my
pains
a
world
of
sighs
she
swore
in
faith
twas
strange
twas
passing
strange
twas
pitiful
twas
wondrous
pitiful
she
wishd
she
had
not
heard
it
yet
she
wishd
that
heaven
had
made
her
such
a
man
she
thankd
me
and
bade
me
if
i
had
a
friend
that
lovd
her
i
should
but
teach
him
how
to
tell
my
story
and
that
would
woo
her
upon
this
hint
i
spake
she
lovd
me
for
the
dangers
i
had
passd
and
i
lovd
her
that
she
did
pity
them
this
only
is
the
witchcraft
i
have
usd
here
comes
the
lady
let
her
witness
it
i
think
this
tale
would
win
my
daughter
too
good
brabantio
take
up
this
mangled
matter
at
the
best
men
do
their
broken
weapons
rather
use
than
their
bare
hands
i
pray
you
hear
her
speak
if
she
confess
that
she
was
half
the
wooer
destruction
on
my
head
if
my
bad
blame
light
on
the
man
come
hither
gentle
mistress
do
you
perceive
in
all
this
noble
company
where
most
you
owe
obedience
my
noble
father
i
do
perceive
here
a
divided
duty
to
you
i
am
bound
for
life
and
education
my
life
and
education
both
do
learn
me
how
to
respect
you
you
are
the
lord
of
duty
i
am
hitherto
your
daughter
but
heres
my
husband
and
so
much
duty
as
my
mother
showd
to
you
preferring
you
before
her
father
so
much
i
challenge
that
i
may
profess
due
to
the
moor
my
lord
god
be
with
you
i
have
done
please
it
your
grace
on
to
the
state
affairs
i
had
rather
to
adopt
a
child
than
get
it
come
hither
moor
i
here
do
give
thee
that
with
all
my
heart
which
but
thou
hast
already
with
all
my
heart
i
would
keep
from
thee
for
your
sake
jewel
i
am
glad
at
soul
i
have
no
other
child
for
thy
escape
would
teach
me
tyranny
to
hang
clogs
on
them
i
have
done
my
lord
let
me
speak
like
yourself
and
lay
a
sentence
which
as
a
grize
or
step
may
help
these
lovers
into
your
favour
when
remedies
are
past
the
griefs
are
ended
by
seeing
the
worst
which
late
on
hopes
depended
to
mourn
a
mischief
that
is
past
and
gone
is
the
next
way
to
draw
new
mischief
on
what
cannot
be
preservd
when
fortune
takes
patience
her
injury
a
mockery
makes
the
robbd
that
smiles
steals
something
from
the
thief
he
robs
himself
that
spends
a
bootless
grief
so
let
the
turk
of
cyprus
us
beguile
we
lose
it
not
so
long
as
we
can
smile
he
bears
the
sentence
well
that
nothing
bears
but
the
free
comfort
which
from
thence
he
hears
but
he
bears
both
the
sentence
and
the
sorrow
that
to
pay
grief
must
of
poor
patience
borrow
these
sentences
to
sugar
or
to
gall
being
strong
on
both
sides
are
equivocal
but
words
are
words
i
never
yet
did
hear
that
the
bruisd
heart
was
pierced
through
the
ear
i
humbly
beseech
you
proceed
to
the
affairs
of
state
the
turk
with
a
most
mighty
preparation
makes
for
cyprus
othello
the
fortitude
of
the
place
is
best
known
to
you
and
though
we
have
there
a
substitute
of
most
allowed
sufficiency
yet
opinion
a
sovereign
mistress
of
effects
throws
a
more
safer
voice
on
you
you
must
therefore
be
content
to
slubber
the
gloss
of
your
new
fortunes
with
this
more
stubborn
and
boisterous
expedition
the
tyrant
custom
most
grave
senators
hath
made
the
flinty
and
steel
couch
of
war
my
thricedriven
bed
of
down
i
do
agnize
a
natural
and
prompt
alacrity
i
find
in
hardness
and
do
undertake
these
present
wars
against
the
ottomites
most
humbly
therefore
bending
to
your
state
i
crave
fit
disposition
for
my
wife
due
reference
of
place
and
exhibition
with
such
accommodation
and
besort
as
levels
with
her
breeding
if
you
please
be
t
at
her
fathers
ill
not
have
it
so
nor
i
nor
i
i
would
not
there
reside
to
put
my
father
in
impatient
thoughts
by
being
in
his
eye
most
gracious
duke
to
my
unfolding
lend
your
gracious
ear
and
let
me
find
a
charter
in
your
voice
to
assist
my
simpleness
what
would
you
desdemona
that
i
did
love
the
moor
to
live
with
him
my
downright
violence
and
storm
of
fortunes
may
trumpet
to
the
world
my
hearts
subdud
even
to
the
very
quality
of
my
lord
i
saw
othellos
visage
in
his
mind
and
to
his
honours
and
his
valiant
parts
did
i
my
soul
and
fortunes
consecrate
so
that
dear
lords
if
i
be
left
behind
a
moth
of
peace
and
he
go
to
the
war
the
rites
for
which
i
love
him
are

adieu
brave
moor
use
desdemona
well
look
to
her
moor
if
thou
hast
eyes
to
see
she
has
deceivd
her
father
and
may
thee
my
life
upon
her
faith
honest
iago
my
desdemona
must
i
leave
to
thee
i
prithee
let
thy
wife
attend
on
her
and
bring
them
after
in
the
best
advantage
come
desdemona
i
have
but
an
hour
of
love
of
worldly
matters
and
direction
to
spend
with
thee
we
must
obey
the
time
iago
what
sayst
thou
noble
heart
what
will
i
do
thinkst
thou
why
go
to
bed
and
sleep
i
will
incontinently
drown
myself
well
if
thou
dost
i
shall
never
love
thee
after
why
thou
silly
gentleman
it
is
silliness
to
live
when
to
live
is
torment
and
then
have
we
a
prescription
to
die
when
death
is
our
physician
o
villanous
i
have
looked
upon
the
world
for
four
times
seven
years
and
since
i
could
distinguish
betwixt
a
benefit
and
an
injury
i
never
found
man
that
knew
how
to
love
himself
ere
i
would
say
i
would
drown
myself
for
the
love
of
a
guineahen
i
would
change
my
humanity
with
a
baboon
what
should
i
do
i
confess
it
is
my
shame
to
be
so
fond
but
it
is
not
in
my
virtue
to
amend
it
virtue
a
fig
tis
in
ourselves
that
we
are
thus
or
thus
our
bodies
are
our
gardens
to
the
which
our
wills
are
gardeners
so
that
if
we
will
plant
nettles
or
sow
lettuce
set
hyssop
and
woed
up
thyme
supply
it
with
one
gender
of
herbs
or
distract
it
with
many
either
to
have
it
sterile
with
idleness
or
manured
with
industry
why
the
power
and
corrigible
authority
of
this
lies
in
our
wills
if
the
balance
of
our
lives
had
not
one
scale
of
reason
to
poise
another
of
sensuality
the
blood
and
baseness
of
our
natures
would
conduct
us
to
most
preposterous
conclusions
but
we
have
reason
to
cool
our
raging
motions
our
carnal
stings
our
unbitted
lusts
whereof
i
take
this
that
you
call
love
to
be
a
sect
or
scion
it
cannot
be
it
is
merely
a
lust
of
the
blood
and
a
permission
of
the
will
come
be
a
man
drown
thyself
drown
cats
and
blind
puppies
i
have
professed
me
thy
friend
and
i
confess
me
knit
to
thy
deserving
with
cables
of
perdurable
toughness
i
could
never
better
stead
thee
than
now
put
money
in
thy
purse
follow
these
wars
defeat
thy
favour
with
a
usurped
beard
i
say
put
money
in
thy
purse
it
cannot
be
that
desdemona
should
long
continue
her
love
to
the
moor
put
money
in
thy
purse
nor
he
his
to
her
it
was
a
violent
commencement
in
her
and
thou
shalt
see
an
answerable
sequestration
put
but
money
in
thy
purse
these
moors
are
changeable
in
their
wills
fill
thy
purse
with
money
the
food
that
to
him
now
is
as
luscious
as
locusts
shall
be
to
him
shortly
as
bitter
as
coloquintida
she
must
change
for
youth
when
she
is
sated
with
his
body
she
will
find
the
error
of
her
choice
she
must
have
change
she
must
therefore
put
money
in
thy
purse
if
thou
wilt
needs
damn
thyself
do
it
a
more
delicate
way
than
drowning
make
all
the
money
thou
canst
if
sanctimony
and
a
frail
vow
betwixt
an
erring
barbarian
and
a
supersubtle
venetian
be
not
too
hard
for
my
wits
and
all
the
tribe
of
hell
thou
shalt
enjoy
her
therefore
make
money
a
pox
of
drowning
thyself
it
is
clean
out
of
the
way
seek
thou
rather
to
be
hanged
in
compassing
thy
joy
than
to
be
drowned
and
go
without
her
wilt
thou
be
fast
to
my
hopes
if
i
depend
on
the
issue
thou
art
sure
of
me
go
make
money
i
have
told
thee
often
and
i
retell
thee
again
and
again
i
hate
the
moor
my
cause
is
hearted
thine
hath
no
less
reason
let
us
be
conjunctive
in
our
revenge
against
him
if
thou
canst
cuckold
him
thou
dost
thyself
a
pleasure
me
a
sport
there
are
many
events
in
the
womb
of
time
which
will
be
delivered
traverse
go
provide
thy
money
we
will
have
more
of
this
tomorrow
adieu
where
shall
we
meet
i
the
morning
at
my
lodging
ill
be
with
thee
betimes
go
to
farewell
do
you
hear
roderigo
what
say
you
no
more
of
drowning
do
you
hear
i
am
changed
ill
sell
all
my
land
go
to
farewell
put
money
enough
in
your
purse
thus
do
i
ever
make
my
fool
my
purse
for
i
mine
own
gaind
knowledge
should
profane
if
i
would
time
expend
with
such
a
snipe
but
for
my
sport
and
profit
i
hate
the
moor
and
it
is
thought
abroad
that
twixt
my
sheets
he
has
done
my
office
i
know
not
if
t
be
true
but
i
for
mere
suspicion
in
that
kind
will
do
as
if
for
surety
he
holds
me
well
the
better
shall
my
purpose
work
on
him
cassios
a
proper
man
let
me
see
now
to
get
his
place
and
to
plume
up
my
will
in
double
knavery
how
how
lets
see
after
some
time
to
abuse
othellos
ear
that
he
is
too
familiar
with
his
wife
he
hath
a
person
and
a
smooth
dispose
to
be
suspected
framed
to
make
women
false
the
moor
is
of
a
free
and
open
nature
that
thinks
men
honest
that
but
seem
to
be
so
and
will
as
tenderly
be
led
by
the
nose
as
asses
are
i
have
t
it
is
engenderd
hell
and
night
must
bring
this
monstrous
birth
to
the
worlds
light
what
from
the
cape
can
you
discern
at
sea
nothing
at
all
it
is
a
highwrought
flood
i
cannot
twixt
the
heaven
and
the
main
descry
a
sail
methinks
the
wind
hath
spoke
aloud
at
land
a
fuller
blast
neer
shook
our
battlements
if
it
hath
ruffiand
so
upon
the
sea
what
ribs
of
oak
when
mountains
melt
on
them
can
hold
the
mortise
what
shall
we
hear
of
this
a
segregation
of
the
turkish
fleet
for
do
but
stand
upon
the
foaming
shore
the
chidden
billow
seems
to
pelt
the
clouds
the
windshakd
surge
with
high
and
monstrous
mane
seems
to
cast
water
on
the
burning
bear
and
quench
the
guards
of
the
everfixed
pole
i
never
did
like
molestation
view
on
the
enchafed
flood
if
that
the
turkish
fleet
be
not
enshelterd
and
embayd
they
are
drownd
it
is
impossible
they
bear
it
out
news
lads
our
wars
are
done
the
desperate
tempest
hath
so
bangd
the
turks
that
their
designment
halts
a
noble
ship
of
venice
hath
seen
a
grievous
wrack
and
sufferance
on
most
part
of
their
fleet
how
is
this
true
the
ship
is
here
put
in
a
veronesa
michael
cassio
lieutenant
to
the
warlike
moor
othello
is
come
on
shore
the
moor
himselfs
at
sea
and
is
in
full
commission
here
for
cyprus
i
am
glad
on
t
tis
a
worthy
governor
but
this
same
cassio
though
he
speak
of
comfort
touching
the
turkish
loss
yet
he
looks
sadly
and
prays
the
moor
be
safe
for
they
were
parted
with
foul
and
violent
tempest
pray
heaven
he
be
for
i
have
servd
him
and
the
man
commands
like
a
full
soldier
lets
to
the
seaside
ho
as
well
to
see
the
vessel
thats
come
in
as
to
throw
out
our
eyes
for
brave
othello
even
till
we
make
the
main
and
the
aerial
blue
an
indistinct
regard
come
lets
do
so
for
every
minute
is
expectancy
of
more
arrivance
thanks
you
the
valiant
of
this
warlike
isle
that
so
approve
the
moor
o
let
the
heavens
give
him
defence
against
the
elements
for
i
have
lost
him
on
a
dangerous
sea
is
he
well
shippd
his
bark
is
stoutly
timberd
and
his
pilot
of
very
expert
and
approvd
allowance
therefore
my
hopes
not
surfeited
to
death
stand
in
bold
cure
what
noise
the
town
is
empty
on
the
brow
o
the
sea
stand
ranks
of
people
and
they
cry
a
sail
my
hopes
do
shape
him
for
the
governor
they
do
discharge
their
shot
of
courtesy
our
friends
at
least
i
pray
you

your
general

fortunately
he
hath
achievd
a
maid
that
paragons
description
and
wild
fame
one
that
excels
the
quirks
of
blazoning
pens
and
in
th
essential
vesture
of
creation
does
tire
the
ingener
how
now
who
has
put
in
tis
one
iago
ancient
to
the
general
he
has
had
most
favourable
and
happy
speed
tempests
themselves
high
seas
and
howling
winds
the
gutterd
rocks
and
congregated
sands
traitors
ensteepd
to
clog
the
guiltless
keel
as
having
sense
of
beauty
do
omit
their
mortal
natures
letting
go
safely
by
the
divine
desdemona
what
is
she
she
that
i
spake
of
our
great
captains

thoughts
a
sennights

and
swell
his

with
thine

tidings

my
lord

is
not

arrivd
nor
know
i
aught
but
that
hes
well
and
will
be
shortly
here
o
but
i
fear
how
lost
you
company
the
great
contention
of
the
sea
and
skies
parted
our
fellowship
but
hark
a
sail
they
give
their
greeting
to
the
citadel

a
friend

for
the
news
good
ancient
you
are
welcome
welcome
mistress
let
it
not
gall
your
patience
good
iago
that
i
extend
my
manners
tis
my
breeding
that
gives
me
this
bold
show
of
courtesy
sir
would
she
give
you
so
much
of
her
lips
as
of
her
tongue
she
oft
bestows
on
me
youd
have
enough
alas
she
has
no
speech
in
faith
too
much
i
find
it
still
when
i
have
list
to
sleep
marry
before
your
ladyship
i
grant
she
puts
her
tongue
a
little
in
her
heart
and
chides
with
thinking
you
have
little
cause
to
say
so
come
on
come
on
you
are
pictures
out
of
doors
bells
in
your
parlours
wild
cats
in
your
kitchens
saints
in
your
injuries
devils
being
offended
players
in
your
housewifery
and
housewives
in
your
beds
o
fie
upon
thee
slanderer
nay
it
is
true
or
else
i
am
a
turk
you
rise
to
play
and
go
to
bed
to
work
you
shall
not
write
my
praise
no
let
me
not
what
wouldst
thou
write
of
me
if
thou
shouldst
praise
me
o
gentle
lady
do
not
put
me
to
t
for
i
am
nothing
if
not
critical
come
on
assay
theres
one
gone
to
the
harbour
ay
madam
i
am
not
merry
but
i
do
beguile
the
thing
i
am
by
seeming
otherwise
come
how
wouldst
thou
praise
me
i
am
about
it
but
indeed
my
invention
comes
from
my
pate
as
birdlime
does
from
frize
it
plucks
out
brains
and
all
but
my
muse
labours
and
thus
she
is
deliverd
if
she
be
fair
and
wise
fairness
and
wit
the
ones
for
use
the
other
useth
it
well
praisd
how
if
she
be
black
and
witty
if
she
be
black
and
thereto
have
a
wit
shell
find
a
white
that
shall
her
blackness
fit
worse
and
worse
how
if
fair
and
foolish
she
never
yet
was
foolish
that
was
fair
for
even
her
folly
helpd
her
to
an
heir
these
are
old
fond
paradoxes
to
make
fools
laugh
i
the
alehouse
what
miserable
praise
hast
thou
for
her
thats
foul
and
foolish
theres
none
so
foul
and
foolish
thereunto
but
does
foul
pranks
which
fair
and
wise
ones
do
o
heavy
ignorance
thou
praisest
the
worst
best
but
what
praise
couldst
thou
bestow
on
a
deserving
woman
indeed
one
that
in
the
authority
of
her
merit
did
justly
put
on
the
vouch
of
very
malice
itself
she
that
was
ever
fair
and
never
proud
had
tongue
at
will
and
yet
was
never
loud
never
lackd
gold
and
yet
went
never
gay
fled
from
her
wish
and
yet
said
now
i
may
she
that
being
angerd
her
revenge
being
nigh
bade
her
wrong
stay
and
her
displeasure
fly
she
that
in
wisdom
never
was
so
frail
to
change
the
cods
head
for
the
salmons
tail
she
that
could
think
and
neer
disclose
her
mind
see
suitors
following
and
not
look
behind
she
was
a
wight
if
ever
such
wight
were
to
do
what
to
suckle
fools
and
chronicle
small
beer
o
most
lame
and
impotent
conclusion
do
not
learn
of
him
emilia
though
he
be
thy
husband
how
say
you
cassio
is
he
not
a
most
profane
and
liberal
counsellor
he
speaks
home
madam
you
may
relish
him
more
in
the
soldier
than
in
the
scholar
he
takes
her
by
the
palm
ay
well
said
whisper
with
as
little
a
web
as
this
will
i
ensnare
as
great
a
fly
as
cassio
ay
smile
upon
her
do
i
will
gyve
thee
in
thine
own
courtship
you
say
true
tis
so
indeed
if
such
tricks
as
these
strip
you
out
of
your
lieutenantry
it
had
been
better
you
had
not
kissed
your
three
fingers
so
oft
which
now
again
you
are
most
apt
to
play
the
sir
in
very
good
well
kissed
an
excellent
courtesy
tis
so
indeed
yet
again
your
fingers
to
your
lips
would
they
were
clysterpipes
for
your
sake
a
trumpet
heard
the
moor
i
know
his
trumpet
tis
truly
so
lets
meet
him
and
receive
him
lo
where
he
comes
o
my
fair
warrior
my
dear
othello
it
gives
me
wonder
great
as
my
content
to
see
you
here
before
me
o
my
souls
joy
if
after
every
tempest
come
such
calms
may
the
winds
blow
till
they
have
wakend
death
and
let
the
labouring
bark
climb
hills
of
seas
olympushigh
and
duck
again
as
low
as
hells
from
heaven
if
it
were
now
to
die
twere
now
to
be
most
happy
for
i
fear
my
soul
hath
her
content
so
absolute
that
not
another
comfort
like
to
this
succeeds
in
unknown
fate
the
heavens
forbid
but
that
our
loves
and
comforts
should
increase
even
as
our
days
do
grow
amen
to
that
sweet
powers
i
cannot
speak
enough
of
this
content
it
stops
me
here
it
is
too
much
of
joy
and
this
and
this
the
greatest
discords
be
that
eer
our
hearts
shall
make
o
you
are
well
tund
now
but
ill
set
down
the
pegs
that
make
this
music
as
honest
as
i
am
come
let
us
to
the
castle
news
friends
our
wars
are
done
the
turks
are
drownd
how
does
my
old
acquaintance
of
this
isle
honey
you
shall
be
well
desird
in
cyprus
i
have
found
great
love
amongst
them
o
my
sweet
i
prattle
out
of
fashion
and
i
dote
in
mine
own
comforts
i
prithee
good
iago
go
to
the
bay
and
disembark
my
coffers
bring
thou
the
master
to
the
citadel
he
is
a
good
one
and
his
worthiness
does
challenge
much
respect
come
desdemona
once
more
well
met
at
cyprus
do
thou
meet
me
presently
at
the
harbour
come
hither
if
thou
best
valiant
as
they
say
base
men
being
in
love
have
then
a
nobility
in
their
natures
more
than
is
native
to
them
list
me
the
lieutenant
tonight
watches
on
the
court
of
guard
first
i
must
tell
thee
this
desdemona
is
directly
in
love
with
him
with
him
why
tis
not
possible
lay
thy
finger
thus
and
let
thy
soul
be
instructed
mark
me
with
what
violence
she
first
loved
the
moor
but
for
bragging
and
telling
her
fantastical
lies
and
will
she
love
him
still
for
prating
let
not
thy
discreet
heart
think
it
her
eye
must
be
fed
and
what
delight
shall
she
have
to
look
on
the
devil
when
the
blood
is
made
dull
with
the
act
of
sport
there
should
be
again
to
inflame
it
and
to
give
satiety
a
fresh
appetite
loveliness
in
favour
sympathy
in
years
manners
and
beauties
all
which
the
moor
is
defective
in
now
for
want
of
these
required
conveniences
her
delicate
tenderness
will
find
itself
abused
begin
to
heave
the
gorge
disrelish
and
abhor
the
moor
very
nature
will
instruct
her
in
it
and
compel
her
to
some
second
choice
now
sir
this
granted
as
it
is
a
most
pregnant
and
unforced
position
who
stands
so
eminently
in
the
degree
of
this
fortune
as
cassio
does
a
knave
very
voluble
no
further
conscionable
than
in
putting
on
the
mere
form
of
civil
and
humane
seeming
for
the
better
compassing
of
his
salt
and
most
hidden
loose
affection
why
none
why
none
a
slipper
and
subtle
knave
a
finderout
of
occasions
that
has
an
eye
can
stamp
and
counterfeit
advantages
though
true
advantage
never
present
itself
a
devilish
knave
besides
the
knave
is
handsome
young
and
hath
all
those
requisites
in
him
that
folly
and
green
minds
look
after
a
pestilent
complete
knave
and
the
woman
hath
found
him
already
i
cannot
believe
that
in
her
she
is
full
of
most
blessed
condition
blessed
figs
end
the
wine
she
drinks
is
made
of
grapes
if
she
had
been
blessed
she
would
never
have
loved
the
moor
blessed
pudding
didst
thou
not
see
her
paddle
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
didst
not
mark
that
yes
that
i
did
but
that
was
but
courtesy
lechery
by
this
hand
an
index
and
obscure
prologue
to
the
history
of
lust
and
foul
thoughts
they
met
so
near
with
their
lips
that
their
breaths
embraced
together
villanous
thoughts
roderigo
when
these
mutualities
so
marshal
the
way
hard
at
hand
comes
the
master
and
main
exercise
the
incorporate
conclusion
pish
but
sir
be
you
ruled
by
me
i
have
brought
you
from
venice
watch
you
tonight
for
the
command
ill
lay
t
upon
you
cassio
knows
you
not
ill
not
be
far
from
you
do
you
find
some
occasion
to
anger
cassio
either
by
speaking
too
loud
or
tainting
his
discipline
or
from
what
other
course
you
please
which
the
time
shall
more
favourably
minister
well
sir
he
is
rash
and
very
sudden
in
choler
and
haply
may
strike
at
you
provoke
him
that
he
may
for
even
out
of
that
will
i
cause
these
of
cyprus
to
mutiny
whose
qualification
shall
come
into
no
true
taste
again
but
by
the
displanting
of
cassio
so
shall
you
have
a
shorter
journey
to
your
desires
by
the
means
i
shall
then
have
to
prefer
them
and
the
impediment
most
profitably
removed
without
the
which
there
were
no
expectation
of
our
prosperity
i
will
do
this
if
i
can
bring
it
to
any
opportunity
i
warrant
thee
meet
me
by
and
by
at
the
citadel
i
must
fetch
his
necessaries
ashore
farewell
adieu
that
cassio
loves
her
i
do
well
believe
it
that
she
loves
him
tis
apt
and
of
great
credit
the
moor
howbeit
that
i
endure
him
not
is
of
a
constant
loving
noble
nature
and
i
dare
think
hell
prove
to
desdemona
a
most
dear
husband
now
i
do
love
her
too
not
out
of
absolute
lust
though
peradventure
i
stand
accountant
for
as
great
a
sin
but
partly
led
to
diet
my
revenge
for
that
i
do
suspect
the
lusty
moor
hath
leapd
into
my
seat
the
thought
whereof
doth
like
a
poisonous
mineral
gnaw
my
inwards
and
nothing
can
or
shall
content
my
soul
till
i
am
evend
with
him
wife
for
wife
or
failing
so
yet
that
i
put
the
moor
at
least
into
a
jealousy
so
strong
that
judgment
cannot
cure
which
thing
to
do
if
this
poor
trash
of
venice
whom
i
trash
for
his
quick
hunting
stand
the
putting
on
ill
have
our
michael
cassio
on
the
hip
abuse
him
to
the
moor
in
the
rank
garb
for
i
fear
cassio
with
my
nightcap
too
make
the
moor
thank
me
love
me
and
reward
me
for
making
him
egregiously
an
ass
and
practising
upon
his
peace
and
quiet
even
to
madness
tis
here
but
yet
confusd
knaverys
plain
face
is
never
seen
till
usd
it
is
othellos
pleasure
our
noble
and
valiant
general
that
upon
certain
tidings
now
arrived
importing
the
mere
perdition
of
the
turkish
fleet
every
man
put
himself
into
triumph
some
to
dance
some
to
make
bonfires
each
man
to
what
sport
and
revels
his
addiction
leads
him
for
besides
these
beneficial
news
it
is
the
celebration
of
his
nuptial
so
much
was
his
pleasure
should
be
proclaimed
all
offices
are
open
and
there
is
full
liberty
of
feasting
from
this
present
hour
of
five
till
the
bell

told

night

her
and
she
is
sport
for
jove
shes
a
most
exquisite
lady
and
ill
warrant
her
full
of
game
indeed
she
is
a
most
fresh
and
delicate
creature
what
an
eye
she
has
methinks
it
sounds
a
parley
of
provocation
an
inviting
eye
and
yet
methinks
right
modest
and
when
she
speaks
is
it
not
an
alarum
to
love
she
is
indeed
perfection
well
happiness
to
their
sheets
come
lieutenant
i
have
a
stoup
of
wine
and
here
without
are
a
brace
of

fain
have
a
measure
to
the
health
of
black
othello
not
tonight
good
iago
i
have
very
poor
and
unhappy
brains
for

they
are
our
friends
but
one
cup
ill
drink
for
you
i
have
drunk
but
one
cup

craftily
qualified
too
and
behold
what
innovation

am
unfortunate
in
the
infirmity
and
dare
not
task
my
weakness
with
any
more
what

a
night

gallants

where

that
which
he
hath
drunk

a
worthy
peer

them
sixpence

too
dear
with
that
he
calld
the
tailor
lown
he
was
a
wight
of
high
renown
and
thou
art
but
of
low
degree
tis
pride
that
pulls
the
country
down
then
take
thine
auld
cloak
about
thee
some
wine
ho
why
this
is
a
more
exquisite
song
than
the
other
will
you
hear
t
again
no
for
i
hold
him
to
be
unworthy
of
his
place
that
does
those
things
well
gods
above
all
and
there
be
souls
must
be
saved
and
there
be
souls
must
not
be
saved
its
true
good
lieutenant
for
mine
own
part
no
offence
to
the
general
nor
any
man
of
quality
i
hope
to
be
saved
and
so
do
i
too
lieutenant
ay
but
by
your
leave
not
before
me
the
lieutenant
is
to
be
saved
before
the
ancient
lets
have
no
more
of
this
lets
to
our
affairs
god
forgive
us
our
sins
gentlemen
lets
look
to
our
business
do
not
think
gentlemen
i
am
drunk
this
is
my
ancient
this
is
my
right
hand
and
this
is
my
left
hand
i
am
not
drunk
now
i
can
stand
well
enough
and
speak
well
enough
excellent
well

very
well
then
you
must
not
think
then
that
i
am
drunk
to
the
platform
masters
come
lets
set
the
watch
you
see
this
fellow
that
is
gone
before
he
is
a
soldier
fit
to
stand
by
c
sar
and
give
direction
and
do
but
see
his
vice
tis
to
his
virtue
a
just
equinox
the
one
as
long
as
the
other
tis
pity
of
him
i
fear
the
trust
othello
puts
him
in
on
some
odd
time
of
his
infirmity
will
shake
this
island
but
is
he
often
thus
tis
evermore
the
prologue
to
his
sleep
hell
watch
the
horologe
a
double
set
if
drink
rock
not
his
cradle
it
were
well
the
general
were
put
in
mind
of
it
perhaps
he
sees
it
not
or
his
good
nature
prizes
the
virtue
that
appears
in
cassio
and
looks
not
on
his
evils
is
not
this
true
how
now
roderigo
i
pray
you
after
the
lieutenant

and
tis
great
pity
that
the
noble
moor
should
hazard
such
a
place
as
his
own
second
with
one
of
an
ingraft
infirmity
it
were
an
honest
action
to
say
so
to
the
moor
not
i
for
this
fair
island

do
love
cassio
well

on
thy
love
i
charge
thee
i
do
not
know
friends
all
but
now
even
now
in
quarter
and
in
terms
like
bride
and
groom
devesting
them
for
bed
and
then
but
now
as
if
some
planet
had
unwitted
men
swords
out
and
tilting
one
at
others
breast
in
opposition
bloody
i
cannot
speak
any
beginning

this
peevish
odds

wont
be
civil
the
gravity
and
stillness
of
your
youth
the
world
hath
noted
and
your
name
is
great
in
mouths
of
wisest
censure
whats
the
matter
that
you
unlace
your
reputation
thus
and
spend
your
rich
opinion
for
the
name
of
a
nightbrawler
give
me
answer
to
it
worthy
othello
i
am
hurt
to
danger
your
officer
iago
can
inform
you
while
i
spare
speech
which
something
now
offends
me
of
all
that
i
do
know
nor
know
i
aught
by
me
thats
said
or
done
amiss
this
night
unless
selfcharity
be
sometimes
a
vice
and
to
defend
ourselves
it
be
a
sin
when
violence
assails
us
now
by
heaven
my
blood
begins
my
safer
guides
to
rule
and
passion
having
my
best
judgment
collied
assays
to
lead
the
way
if
i
once
stir
or
do
but
lift
this
arm
the
best
of
you
shall
sink
in
my
rebuke
give
me
to
know
how
this
foul
rout
began
who
set
it
on
and
he
that
is
approvd
in
this
offence
though
he
had
twinnd
with
me
both
at
a
birth
shall
lose
me
what
in
a
town
of
war
yet
wild
the
peoples
hearts
brimful
of
fear
to
manage
private
and
domestic
quarrel
in
night
and
on
the
court
and
guard
of
safety
tis
monstrous
iago
who
began
t
if
partially
affind
or
leagud
in
office
thou
dost
deliver
more
or
less
than
truth
thou
art
no
soldier
touch
me
not
so
near
i
had
rather
have
this
tongue
cut
from
my
mouth
than
it
should
do
offence
to
michael
cassio
yet
i
persuade
myself
to
speak
the
truth
shall
nothing
wrong
him
thus
it
is
general
montano
and
myself
being
in
speech
there
comes
a
fellow
crying
out
for
hep
and
cassio
following
with
determind
sword
to
execute
upon
him
sir
this
gentleman
steps
in
to
cassio
and
entreats
his
pause
myself
the
crying
fellow
did
pursue
lest
by
his
clamour
as
it
so
fell
out
the
town
might
fall
in
fright
he
swift
of
foot
outran
my
purpose
and
i
returnd
the
rather
for
that
i
heard
the
clink
and
fall
of
swords
and
cassio
high
in
oath
which
till
tonight
i
neer
might
say
before
when
i
came
back
for
this
was
brief
i
found
them
close
together
at
blow
and
thrust
even
as
again
they
were
when
you
yourself
did
part
them
more
of
this
matter
can
i
not
report
but
men
are
men
the
best
sometimes
forget
though
cassio
did
some
little
wrong
to
him
as
men
in
rage
strike
those
that
wish
them
best
yet
surely
cassio
i
believe
receivd
from
him
that
fled
some
strange
indignity
which
patience
could
not
pass
i
know
iago
thy
honesty
and
love
doth
mince
this
matter
making
it
light
to
cassio
cassio
i
love
thee
but
never
more
be
officer
of
mine
look
if
my
gentle
love
be
not
raisd
up
ill
make
thee
an
example
whats
the
matter
alls
well
now
sweeting
come
away
to
bed
sir
for
your
hurts
myself
will
be
your
surgeon
lead
him
off
iago
look
with
care
about
the
town
and
silence
those
whom
this
vile
brawl
distracted
come
desdemona
tis
the
soldiers
life
to
have
their
balmy
slumbers
wakd
with
strife
what
are
you
hurt
lieutenant
ay
past
all
surgery
marry
heaven
forbid
reputation
reputation
reputation
o
i
have
lost
my
reputation
i
have
lost
the
immortal
part
of
myself
and
what
remains
is
bestial
my
reputation
iago
my
reputation
as
i
am
an
honest
man
i
thought
you
had
received
some
bodily
wound
there
is
more
offence
in
that
than
in
reputation
reputation
is
an
idle
and
most
false
imposition
oft
got
without
merit
and
lost
without
deserving
you
have
lost
no
reputation
at
all
unless
you
repute
yourself
such
a
loser
what
man
there
are
ways
to
recover
the
general
again
you
are
but
now
cast
in
his
mood
a
punishment
more
in
policy
than
in
malice
even
so
as
one
would
beat
his
offenceless
dog
to
affright
an
imperious
lion
sue
to
him
again
and
he
is
yours
i
will
rather
sue
to
be
despised
than
to
deceive
so
good
a
commander
with
so
slight
so
drunken
and
so
indiscreet
an
officer
drunk
and
speak
parrot
and
squabble
swagger
swear
and
discourse
fustian
with
ones
own
shadow
o
thou
invisible
spirit
of
wine
if
thou
hast
no
name
to
be
known
by
let
us
call
thee
devil
what
was
he
that
you
followed
with
your
sword
what
had
he
done
to
you
i
know
not
is
t
possible
i
remember
a
mass
of
things
but
nothing
distinctly
a
quarrel
but
nothing
wherefore
o
god
that
men
should
put
an
enemy
in
their
mouths
to
steal
away
their
brains
that
we
should
with
joy
pleasance
revel
and
applause
transform
ourselves
into
beasts
why
but
you
are
now
well
enough
how
came
you
thus
recovered
it
hath
pleased
the
devil
drunkenness
to
give
place
to
the
devil
wrath
one
unperfectness
shows
me
another
to
make
me
frankly
despise
myself
come
you
are
too
severe
a
moraler
as
the
time
the
place
and
the
condition
of
this
country
stands
i
could
heartily
wish
this
had
not
befallen
but
since
it
is
as
it
is
mend
it
for
your
own
good
i
will
ask
him
for
my
place
again
he
shall
tell
me
i
am
a
drunkard
had
i
as
many
mouths
as
hydra
such
an
answer
would
stop
them
all
to
be
now
a
sensible
man
by
and
by
a
fool
and
presently
a
beast
o
strange
every
inordinate
cup
is
unblessed
and
the
ingredient
is
a
devil
come
come
good
wine
is
a
good
familiar
creature
if
it
be
well
used
exclaim
no
more
against
it
and
good
lieutenant
i
think
you
think
i
love
you
i
have
well
approved
it
sir
i
drunk
you
or
any
man
living
may
be
drunk
at
some
time
man
ill
tell
you
what
you
shall
do
our
generals
wife
is
now
the
general
i
may
say
so
in
this
respect
for
that
he
hath
devoted
and
given
up
himself
to
the
contemplation
mark
and
denotement
of
her
parts
and
graces
confess
yourself
freely
to
her
importune
her
shell
help
to
put
you
in
your
place
again
she
is
of
so
free
so
kind
so
apt
so
blessed
a
disposition
that
she
holds
it
a
vice
in
her
goodness
not
to
do
more
than
she
is
requested
this
broken
joint
between
you
and
her
husband
entreat
her
to
splinter
and
my
fortunes
against
any
lay
worth
naming
this
crack
of
your
love
shall
grow
stronger
than
it
was
before
you
advise
me
well
i
protest
in
the
sincerity
of
love
and
honest
kindness
i
think
it
freely
and
betimes
in
the
morning
i
will
beseech
the
virtuous
desdemona
to
undertake
for
me
i
am
desperate
of
my
fortunes
if
they
check
me
here
you
are
in
the
right
good
night
lieutenant
i
must
to
the
watch
good
night
honest
iago
and
whats
he
then
that
says
i
play
the
villain
when
this
advice
is
free
i
give
and
honest
probal
to
thinking
and
indeed
the
course
to
win
the
moor
again
for
tis
most
easy
the
inclining
desdemona
to
subdue
in
any
honest
suit
shes
framd
as
fruitful
as
the
free
elements
and
then
for
her
to
win
the
moor
were
t
to
renounce
his
baptism
all
seals
and
symbols
of
redeemed
sin
his
soul
is
so
enfetterd
to
her
love
that
she
may
make
unmake
do
what
she
list
even
as
her
appetite
shall
play
the
god
with
his
weak
function
how
am
i
then
a
villain
to
counsel
cassio
to
this
parallel
course
directly
to
his
good
divinity
of
hell
when
devils
will
the
blackest
sins
put
on
they
do
suggest
at
first
with
heavenly
shows
as
i
do
now
for
while
this
honest
fool
plies
desdemona
to
repair
his
fortunes
and
she
for
him
pleads
strongly
to
the
moor
ill
pour
this
pestilence
into
his
ear
that
she
repeals
him
for
her
bodys
lust
and
by
how
much
she
strives
to
do
him
good
she
shall
undo
her
credit
with
the
moor
so
will
i
turn
her
virtue
into
pitch
and
out
of
her
own
goodness
make
the
net
that
shall
enmesh
them
all
how
now
roderigo
i
do
follow
here
in
the
chase
not
like
a
hound
that
hunts
but
one
that
fills
up
the
cry
my
money
is
almost
spent
i
have
been
tonight
exceedingly
well
cudgelled
and
i
think
the
issue
will
be
i
shall
have
so
much
experience
for
my
pains
and
so
with
no
money
at
all
and
a
little
more
wit
return
again
to
venice
how
poor
are
they
that
have
not
patience
what
wound
did
ever
heal
but
by
degrees
thou
knowst
we
work
by
wit
and
not
by
witchcraft
and
wit
depends
on
dilatory
time
does
t
not
go
well
cassio
hath
beaten
thee
and
thou
by
that
small
hurt
hast
cashiered
cassio
though
other
things
grow
fair
against
the
sun
yet
fruits
that
blossom
first
will
first
be
ripe
content
thyself
awhile
by
the
mass
tis
morning
pleasure
and
action
make
the
hours
seem
short
retire
thee
go
where
thou
art
billeted
away
i
say
thou
shalt
know
more
hereafter
nay
get
thee
gone

things

to
be
done
my
wife

move
for
cassio
to
her
mistress

her
on

while

wholesome
wisdom
he
might
not

face
i
prithee
call

and
yet
his
trespass
in
our
common
reason
save
that
they
say
the
wars
must
make
examples
out
of
their
best
is
not
almost
a
fault
to
incur
a
private
check

in
my
soul

could
do
much
prithee

more
let
him
come
when

will
i
will
deny

nothing
why

not
a
boon

as
i
should
entreat
you

your
gloves
or
feed
on
nourishing
dishes
or
keep
you
warm
or
sue
to
you
to
do
a
peculiar
profit
to
your
own
person

have
a
suit
wherein

of
poise
and
difficult
weight
and
fearful
to
be
granted
i
will
deny
thee
nothing
whereon
i
do
beseech
thee

me
this
to
leave
me

a
little
to

thought
iago
i
did
not
think
he
had
been
acquainted
with
her
o
yes
and
went
between
us
very
oft
indeed
indeed
ay
indeed
discernst
thou
aught
in
that
is
he
not
honest
honest
my
lord
honest
ay
honest
my
lord
for
aught
i
know
what
dost
thou
think
think
my
lord
think
my
lord
by
heaven
he
echoes
me
as
if
there
were
some
monster
in
his
thought
too
hideous
to
be
shown
thou
dost
mean
something
i
heard
thee
say
but
now
thou
likdst
not
that
when
cassio
left
my
wife
what
didst
not
like
and
when
i
told
thee
he
was
of
my
counsel
in
my
whole
course
of
wooing
thou
criedst
indeed
and
didst
contract
and
purse
thy
brow
together
as
if
thou
then
hadst
shut
up
in
thy
brain
some
horrible
conceit
if
thou
dost
love
me
show
me
thy
thought
my
lord
you
know
i
love
you
i
think
thou
dost
and
for
i
know
thou
art
full
of
love
and
honesty
and
weighst
thy
words
before
thou
givst
them
breath
therefore
these
stops
of
thine
fright
me
the
more
for
such
things
in
a
false
disloyal
knave
are
tricks
of
custom
but
in
a
man
thats
just
they
are
close
delations
working
from
the
heart
that
passion
cannot
rule
for
michael
cassio
i
dare
be
sworn
i
think
that
he
is
honest
i
think
so
too
men
should
be
what
they
seem
or
those
that
be
not
would
they
might
seem
none
certain
men
should
be
what
they
seem
why
then
i
think
cassio
s
an
honest
man
nay
yet
theres
more
in
this
i
pray
thee
speak
to
me
as
to
thy
thinkings
as
thou
dost
ruminate
and
give
thy
worst
of
thoughts
the
worst
of
words
good
my
lord
pardon
me
though
i
am
bound
to
every
act
of
duty
i
am
not
bound
to
that
all
slaves
are
free
to
utter
my
thoughts
why
say
they
are
vile
and
false
as
wheres
that
palace
whereinto
foul
things
sometimes
intrude
not
who
has
a
breast
so
pure
but
some
uncleanly
apprehensions
keep
leets
and
law
days
and
in
session
sit
with
meditations
lawful
thou
dost
conspire
against
thy
friend
iago
if
thou
but
thinkst
him
wrongd
and
makst
his
ear
a
stranger
to
thy
thoughts
i
do
beseech
you
though
i
perchance
am
vicious
in
my
guess
as
i
confess
it
is
my
natures
plague
to
spy
into
abuses
and
oft
my
jealousy
shapes
faults
that
are
not
that
your
wisdom
yet
from
one
that
so
imperfectly
conceits
would
take
no
notice
nor
build
yourself
a
trouble
out
of
his
scattering
and
unsure
observance
it
were
not
for
your
quiet
nor
your
good
nor
for
my
manhood
honesty
or
wisdom
to
let
you
know
my
thoughts
what
dost
thou
mean
good
name
in
man
and
woman
dear
my
lord
is
the
immediate
jewel
of
their
souls
who
steals
my
purse
steals
trash
tis
something
nothing
twas
mine
tis
his
and
has
been
slave
to
thousands
but
he
that
filches
from
me
my
good
name
robs
me
of
that
which
not
enriches
him
and
makes
me
poor
indeed
by
heaven
ill
know
thy
thoughts
you
cannot
if
my
heart
were
in
your
hand
nor
shall
not
whilst
tis
in
my
custody
ha
o
beware
my
lord
of
jealousy
it
is
the
greeneyd
monster
which
doth
mock
the
meat
it
feeds
on
that
cuckold
lives
in
bliss
who
certain
of
his
fate
loves
not
his
wronger
but
o
what
damned
minutes
tells
he
oer
who
dotes
yet
doubts
suspects
yet
soundly
loves
o
misery
poor
and
content
is
rich
and
rich
enough
but
riches
fineless
is
as
poor
as
winter
to
him
that
ever
fears
he
shall
be
poor
good
heaven
the
souls
of
all
my
tribe
defend
from
jealousy
why
why
is
this
thinkst
thou
id
make
a
life
of
jealousy
to
follow
still
the
changes
of
the
moon
with
fresh
suspicions
no
to
be
once
in
doubt
is
once
to
be
resolved
exchange
me
for
a
goat
when
i
shall
turn
the
business
of
my
soul
to
such
exsufflicate
and
blown
surmises
matching
thy
inference
tis
not
to
make
me
jealous
to
say
my
wife
is
fair
feeds
well
loves
company
is
free
of
speech
sings
plays
and
dances
well
where
virtue
is
these
are
more
virtuous
nor
from
mine
own
weak
merits
will
i
draw
the
smallest
fear
or
doubt
of
her
revolt
for
she
had
eyes
and
chose
me
no
iago
ill
see
before
i
doubt
when
i
doubt
prove
and
on
the
proof
there
is
no
more
but
this
away
at
once
with
love
or
jealousy
i
am
glad
of
it
for
now
i
shall
have
reason
to
show
the
love
and
duty
that
i
bear
you
with
franker
spirit
therefore
as
i
am
bound
receive
it
from
me
i
speak
not
yet
of
proof
look
to
your
wife
observe
her
well
with
cassio
wear
your
eye
thus
not
jealous
nor
secure
i
would
not
have
your
free
and
noble
nature
out
of
selfbounty
be
abusd
look
to
t
i
know
our
country
disposition
well
in
venice
they
do
let
heaven
see
the
pranks
they
dare
not
show
their
husbands
their
best
conscience
is
not
to
leave
t
undone
but
keep
t
unknown
dost
thou
say
so
she
did
deceive
her
father
marrying
you
and
when
she
seemd
to
shake
and
fear
your
looks
she
lovd
them
most
and
so
she
did
why
go
to
then
she
that
so
young
could
give
out
such
a
seeming
to
seel
her
fathers
eyes
up
close
as
oak
he
thought
twas
witchcraft
but
i
am
much
to
blame
i
humbly
do
beseech
you
of
your
pardon
for
too
much
loving
you
i
am
bound
to
thee
for
ever
i
see
this
hath
a
little
dashd
your
spirits
not
a
jot
not
a
jot
i
faith
i
fear
it
has
i
hope
you
will
consider
what
is
spoke
comes
from
my
love
but
i
do
see
youre
movd
i
am
to
pray
you
not
to
strain
my
speech
to
grosser
issues
nor
to
larger
reach
than
to
suspicion
i
will
not
should
you
do
so
my
lord
my
speech
should
fall
into
such
vile
success
as
my
thoughts
aim
not
at
cassios
my
worthy
friend
my
lord
i
see
youre
movd
no
not
much
movd
i
do
not
think
but
desdemonas
honest
long
live
she
so
and
long
live
you
to
think
so
and
yet
how
nature
erring
from
itself
ay
theres
the
point
as
to
be
bold
with
you
not
to
affect
many
proposed
matches
of
her
own
clime
complexion
and
degree
whereto
we
see
in
all
things
nature
tends
foh
one
may
smell
in
such
a
will
most
rank
foul
disproportion
thoughts
unnatural
but
pardon
me
i
do
not
in
position
distinctly
speak
of
her
though
i
may
fear
her
will
recoiling
to
her
better
judgment
may
fail
to
match
you
with
her
country
forms
and
happily
repent
farewell
farewell
if
more
thou
dost
perceive
let
me
know
more
set
on
thy
wife
to
observe
leave
me
iago
my
lord
i
take
my
leave
why
did
i
marry
this
honest
creature
doubtless
sees
and
knows
more
much
more
than
he
unfolds
my
lord
i
would
i
might
entreat
your
honour
to
scan
this
thing
no
further
leave
it
to
time
although
tis
fit
that
cassio
have
his
place
for
sure
he
fills
it
up
with
great
ability
yet
if
you
please
to
hold
him
off
awhile
you
shall
by
that
perceive
him
and
his
means
note
if
your
lady
strain
his
entertainment
with
any
strong
or
vehement
importunity
much
will
be
seen
in
that
in
the
mean
time
let
me
be
thought
too
busy
in
my
fears
as
worthy
cause
i
have
to
fear
i
am
and
hold
her
free
i
do
beseech
your
honour
fear
not
my
government
i
once
more
take
my
leave
this
fellows
of
exceeding
honesty
and
knows
all
qualities
with
a
learned
spirit
of
human
dealings
if
i
do
prove
her
haggard
though
that
her
jesses
were
my
dear
heartstrings
id
whistle
her
off
and
let
her
down
the
wind
to
prey
at
fortune
haply
for
i
am
black
and
have
not
those
soft
parts
of
conversation
that
chamberers
have
or
for
i
am
declind
into
the
vale
of
years
yet
thats
not
much
shes
gone
i
am
abusd
and
my
relief
must
be
to
loathe
her
o
curse
of
marriage
that
we
can
call
these
delicate
creatures
ours
and
not
their
appetites
i
had
rather
be
a
toad
and
live
upon
the
vapour
of
a
dungeon
than
keep
a
corner
in
the
thing
i
love
for
others
uses
yet
tis
the
plague
of
great
ones
prerogativd
are
they
less
than
the
base
tis
destiny
unshunnable
like
death
even
then
this
forked
plague
is
fated
to
us
when
we
do
quicken
look
where
she
comes
if
she
be
false
o
then
heaven
mocks
itself
ill
not
believe
it
how
now
my
dear
othello
your
dinner
and
the
generous
islanders

attend
your
presence

to
blame

a
pain
upon
my
forehead

this
hour

too
little

go
in
with
you
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
are
not
well
i
am
glad
i
have
found
this
napkin
this
was
her
first
remembrance
from
the
moor
my
wayward
husband
hath
a
hundred
times
wood
me
to
steal
it
but
she
so
loves
the
token
for
he
conjurd
her
she
should
ever
keep
it
that
she
reserves
it
evermore
about
her
to
kiss
and
talk
to
ill
have
the
work
taen
out
and
give
t
iago
what
he
will
do
with
it
heaven
knows
not
i
i
nothing
but
to
please
his
fantasy
how
now
what
do
you
here
alone
do
not
you
chide
i
have
a
thing
for
you
a
thing
for
me

is
a
common
thing
ha
to
have
a
foolish
wife
o
is
that
all
what
will
you
give
me
now
for
that
same
handkerchief
what
handkerchief
what
handkerchief
why
that
the
moor
first
gave
to
desdemona
that
which
so
often
you
did
bid
me
steal
hast
stoln
it
from
her
no
faith
she
let
it
drop
by
negligence
and
to
the
advantage
i
being
there
tookt
up
look
here
it
is
a
good
wench
give
it

in
cassios
lodging
lose

napkin
and
let
him
find

trifles
light
as
air

to
the
jealous
confirmations
strong
as
proofs
of
holy
writ
this
may
do
something
the
moor
already
changes
with
my
poison
dangerous
conceits
are
in
their
natures
poisons
which
at
the
first
are
scarce
found
to
distaste
but
with
a
little
act
upon
the
blood
burn
like
the
mines
of
sulphur
i
did
say
so
look
where
he
comes
not
poppy
nor
mandragora
nor
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
world
shall
ever
medicine
thee
to
that
sweet
sleep
which
thou
owdst
yesterday
ha
ha
false

gone
thou
hast
set
me
on
the
rack
i
swear
tis
better
to
be
much
abusd
than
but
to
know
t
a
little
how
now
my
lord
what
sense
had
i
of
her
stoln
hours
of
lust
i
saw
t
not
thought
it
not
it
harmd
not
me
i
slept
the
next
night
well
was
free
and
merry

found
not
cassios

i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
i
had
been
happy
if
the
general
camp

and
all
had
tasted
her
sweet
body
so
i
had
nothing
known
o
now
for
ever
farewell

thou
prove
my
love
a
whore
be
sure
of
it
give
me
the
ocular
proof
or
by
the
worth
of
mine
eternal
soul
thou
hadst
been
better
have
been
born
a
dog
than
answer
my
wakd
wrath
is
t
come
to

on
or
woe
upon

my
noble
lord
if

and
torture

never
pray
more
abandon
all
remorse
on
horrors

do
deeds
to
make

amazd
for

canst
thou
to
damnation
add
greater
than
that
o
grace
o
heaven
forgive
me
are
you
a
man
have
you
a
soul
or
sense
god
be
wi
you
take
mine
office
o
wretched
fool
that
livst
to
make
thine
honesty
a
vice
o
monstrous
world
take
note
take
note
o
world
to
be
direct
and
honest
is
not
safe
i
thank
you
for
this
profit
and
from
hence
ill
love
no
friend
sith
love
breeds
such
offence
nay
stay
thou
shouldst
be
honest
i
should
be
wise
for
honestys
a
fool
and
loses
that
it
works
for
by
the
world
i
think
my
wife
be
honest
and
think
she
is
not
i
think
that
thou
art
just
and
think
thou
art
not
ill
have
some
proof
her
name
that
was
as
fresh
as
dians
visage
is
now
begrimd
and
black
as
mine
own
face
if
there
be
cords
or
knives
poison
or
fire
or
suffocating
streams
ill
not
endure
it
would
i
were
satisfied
i
see
sir
you
are
eaten
up
with
passion
i
do
repent
me
that
i
put
it
to
you
you
would
be
satisfied
would
nay
i
will
and
may
but
how
how
satisfied
my
lord
would
you
the
supervisor
grossly
gape
on
behold
her
tuppd
death
and
damnation
o
it
were
a
tedious
difficulty
i
think
to
bring
them
to
that
prospect
damn
them
then
if
ever
mortal
eyes
do
see
them
bolster
more
than
their
own
what
then
how
then
what
shall
i
say
wheres
satisfaction
it
is
impossible
you
should
see
this
were
they
as
prime
as
goats
as
hot
as
monkeys
as
salt
as
wolves
in
pride
and
fools
as
gross
as
ignorance
made
drunk
but
yet
i
say
if
imputation
and
strong
circumstances
which
lead
directly
to
the
door
of
truth
will
give
you
satisfaction
you
may
have
it
give
me
a
living
reason
shes
disloyal
i
do
not
like
the
office
but
sith
i
am
enterd
in
this
cause
so
far
prickd
to
t
by
foolish
honesty
and
love
i
will
go
on
i
lay
with
cassio
lately
and
being
troubled
with
a
raging
tooth
i
could
not
sleep
there
are
a
kind
of
men
so
loose
of
soul
that
in
their
sleeps
will
mutter
their
affairs
one
of
this
kind
is
cassio
in
sleep
i
heard
him
say
sweet
desdemona
let
us
be
wary
let
us
hide
our
loves
and
then
sir
would
he
gripe
and
wring
my
hand
cry
o
sweet
creature
and
then
kiss
me
hard
as
if
he
pluckd
up
kisses
by
the
roots
that
grew
upon
my
lips
then
laid
his
leg
over
my
thigh
and
sighd
and

and
then
cried
cursed
fate
that
gave
thee
to
the
moor
o
monstrous
monstrous
nay
this
was
but
his
dream
but
this
denoted
a
foregone
conclusion
tis
a
shrewd
doubt
though
it
be
but
a
dream
and
this
may
help
to
thicken
other
proofs
that
do
demonstrate
thinly
ill
tear
her
all
to
pieces
nay
but
be
wise
yet
we
see
nothing
done
she
may
be
honest
yet
tell
me
but
this
have
you
not
sometimes
seen
a
handkerchief
spotted
with
strawberries
in
your
wifes
hand
i
gave
her
such
a
one
twas
my
first
gift
i
know
not
that
but
such
a
handkerchief
i
am
sure
it
was
your
wifes
did
i
today
see
cassio
wipe
his
beard
with
if
it
be
that
if
it
be
that
or
any
that
was
hers
it
speaks
against
her
with
the
other
proofs
o
that
the
slave
had
forty
thousand
lives
one
is
too
poor
too
weak
for
my
revenge
now
do
i
see
tis

my
fond
love
thus
do
i
blow
to
heaven

vengeance
from
the
hollow
hell
yield
up
o
love
thy
crown
and
hearted
throne
to
tyrannous
hate

with
thy
fraught
for

of
aspics

content
o

i
say
your

icy
current
and
compulsive
course
neer
feels
retiring
ebb
but
keeps
due
on
to
the

and
the
hellespont
even
so
my
bloody
thoughts
with
violent
pace
shall
neer
look
back

ebb
to
humble
love
till
that
a
capable
and
wide
revenge
swallow

of

be
in
me
remorse
what
bloody
business

thanks
but
with
acceptance
bounteous
and
will
upon
the
instant
put
thee
to

within
these
three
days
let
me
hear
thee
say
that
cassios

minx
o
damn

with
me
apart
i
will
withdraw
to
furnish
me
with
some
swift
means
of
death
for
the
fair
devil
now
art
thou
my
lieutenant
i
am
your
own
for
ever
do
you
know
sirrah
where
lieutenant
cassio
lies
i
dare
not
say
he
lies
any
where
why
man
he
is
a
soldier
and
for
one
to
say
a
soldier
lies
is
stabbing
go
to
where
lodges
he
to
tell
you
where
he
lodges
is
to
tell
you
where
i
lie
can
anything
be
made
of
this
i
know
not
where
he
lodges
and
for
me
to
devise
a
lodging
and
say
he
lies
here
or
he
lies
there
were
to
lie
in
mine
own
throat
can
you
inquire
him
out
and
be
edified
by
report
i
will
catechize
the
world
for
him
that
is
make
questions
and
by
them
answer
seek
him
bid
him
come
hither
tell
him
i
have
moved
my
lord
in
his
behalf
and
hope
all
will
be
well
to
do
this
is
within
the
compass
of
mans
wit
and
therefore
i
will
attempt
the
doing
it
where
should
i
lose
that
handkerchief
emilia
i
know
not
madam
believe
me
i
had
rather
have
lost
my
purse
full
of
cruzadoes
and
but
my
noble
moor
is
true
of
mind
and
made
of
no
such
baseness
as
jealous
creatures
are
it
were
enough
to
put
him
to
ill
thinking
is
he
not
jealous
who
he
i
think
the
sun
where
he
was
born
drew
all
such
humours
from
him
look
where
he
comes
i
will
not
leave
him
now
till
cassio
be
calld
to
him
how
is
t
with
you
my
lord
well
my
good
lady
o
hardness
to
dissemble
how
do
you
desdemona
well
my
good
lord
give
me
your
hand
this
hand
is
moist
my
lady
it
yet
has
felt
no
age
nor
known
no
sorrow
this
argues
fruitfulness
and
liberal
heart
hot
hot
and
moist
this
hand
of
yours
requires
a
sequester
from
liberty
fasting
and
prayer
much
castigation
exercise
devout
for
heres
a
young
and
sweating
devil
here
that
commonly
rebels
tis
a
good
hand
a
frank
one
you
may
indeed
say
so
for
twas
that
hand
that
gave
away
my
heart
a
liberal
hand
the
hearts
of
old
gave
hands
but
our
new
heraldry
is
hands
not
hearts
i
cannot
speak
of
this
come
now
your
promise
what
promise
chuck
i
have
sent
to
bid
cassio
come
speak
with
you
i
have
a
salt
and
sorry
rheum
offends
me
lend
me
thy
handkerchief
here
my
lord
that
which
i
gave
you
i
have
it
not
about
me
not
no
indeed
my
lord
that
is
a
fault
that
handkerchief
did
an
egyptian
to
my
mother
give
she
was
a
charmer
and
could
almost
read
the
thoughts
of
people
she
told
her
while
she
kept
it
twould
make
her
amiable
and
subdue
my
father
entirely
to
her
love
but
if
she
lost
it
or
made
a
gift
of
it
my
fathers
eye
should
hold
her
loathed
and
his
spirits
should
hunt
after
new
fancies
she
dying
gave
it
me
and
bid
me
when
my
fate
would
have
me
wive
to
give
it
her
i
did
so
and
take
heed
on
t
make
it
a
darling
like
your
precious
eye
to
loset
or
givet
away
were
such
perdition
as
nothing
else
could
match
is
t
possible
tis
true
theres
magic
in
the
web
of
it
a
sibyl
that
had
numberd
in
the
world
the
sun
to
course
two
hundred
compasses
in
her
prophetic
fury
sewd
the
work
the
worms
were
hallowd
that
did
breed
the
silk
and
it
was
dyd
in
mummy
which
the
skilful
conservd
of
maidens

tis
not
a
year
or
two
shows

a
man
they

i
do
beseech
you
that
by
your
virtuous
means
i
may
again
exist
and
be
a
member
of
his
love
whom
i
with
all
the
office
of
my
heart
entirely
honour
i
would
not
be
delayd
if
my
offence
be
of
such
mortal
kind
that
nor
my
service
past
nor
present
sorrows
nor
purposd
merit
in
futurity
can
ransom
me
into
his
love
again
but
to
know
so
must
be
my
benefit
so
shall
i
clothe
me
in
a
forcd
content
and
shut
myself
up
in
some
other
course
to
fortunes
alms
alas
thricegentle
cassio
my
advocation
is
not
now
in
tune
my
lord
is
not
my
lord
nor
should
i
know
him
were
he
in
favour
as
in
humour
alterd
so
help
me
every
spirit
sanctified
as
i
have
spoken
for
you
all
my
best
and
stood
within
the
blank
of
his
displeasure
for
my
free
speech
you
must
awhile
be
patient
what
i
can
do
i
will
and
more
i
will
than
for
myself
i
dare
let
that
suffice
you
is
my
lord
angry
he
went
hence
but
now
and
certainly
in
strange
unquietness
can
he
be
angry
i
have
seen
the
cannon
when
it
hath
blown
his
ranks
into
the
air
and
like
the
devil
from
his
very
arm
puffd
his
own
brother
and
can
he
be
angry
something
of
moment
then
i
will
go
meet
him
theres
matter
in
t
indeed
if
he
be
angry
i
prithee
do
so
something
sure
of
state
either
from
venice
or
some
unhatchd
practice
made
demonstrable
here
in
cyprus
to
him
hath
puddled
his
clear
spirit
and
in
such
cases
mens
natures
wrangle
with
inferior
things
though
great
ones
are
their
object
tis
even
so
for
let
our
finger
ache
and
it
indues
our
other
healthful
members
evn
to
that
sense
of
pain
nay
we
must
think
men
are
not
gods
nor
of
them
look
for
such
observancy
as
fits
the
bridal
beshrew
me
much
emilia
i
was
unhandsome
warrior
as
i
am
arraigning
his
unkindness
with
my
soul
but
now
i
find
i
had
subornd
the
witness
and
hes
indicted
falsely
pray
heaven
it
be
statematters
as
you
think
and
no
conception
nor
no
jealous
toy
concerning
you
alas
the
day
i
never
gave
him
cause
but
jealous
souls
will
not
be
answerd
so
they
are
not
ever
jealous
for
the
cause
but
jealous
for
they
are
jealous
tis
a
monster
begot
upon
itself
born
on
itself

that
monster

weary
reckoning
pardon

bianca
i
have
this
while
with
leaden
thoughts
been
pressd
but

more
continuate
time
strike
off
this
score
of
absence
sweet
bianca
take
me
this
work
out
o
cassio
whence
came
this
this
is
some
token
from
a
newer
friend
to

felt
absence
now
i
feel
a
cause
is
t
come
to
this
well
well
go
to
woman
throw
your
vile
guesses
in
the
devils
teeth
from
whence
you
have
them

jealous
now
that
this
is
from
some
mistress
some
remembrance

in
good
troth
bianca
why

is
it
i
know
not
sweet
i
found
it
in
my
chamber

like

work
well
ere

be
demanded

like
enough
it
will
id
have
it
copied
take
it
and
do
t
and
leave
me
for
this
time
leave
you
wherefore
i
do
attend

my
wish
to
have
him

me
womand
why
i
pray
you
not
that
i
love
you

a
little
way
that

can
bring
you

i
attend
here
but
ill
see
you
soon
tis
very
good
i
must
be
circumstancd
will
you
think
so
think
so
iago
what
to
kiss
in
private
an
unauthorizd
kiss
or
to
be
naked
with
her
friend
abed
an
hour
or
more
not
meaning
any
harm
naked
abed
iago
and
not
mean
harm
it
is
hypocrisy
against
the
devil
they
that
mean
virtuously
and
yet
do
so
the
devil
their
virtue
tempts
and
they
tempt
heaven
if
they
do
nothing
tis
a
venial
slip
but
if
i
give
my
wife
a
handkerchief
what
then
why
then
tis
hers
my
lord
and
being
hers
she
may
i
think
bestow
t
on
any
man
she
is
protectress
of
her
honour
too
may
she
give
that
her
honour
is
an
essence
thats
not
seen
they
have
it
very
oft
that
have
it
not
but
for
the
handkerchief
by
heaven
i
would
most
gladly
have
forgot
it
thou
saidst
o
it
comes
oer
my
memory
as
doth
the
raven
oer
the
infected
house
boding
to
all
he
had
my
handkerchief
ay
what
of
that
thats
not
so
good
now
what
if
i
had
said
i
had
seen
him
do
you
wrong
or
heard
him
say
as
knaves
be
such
abroad
who
having
by
their
own
importunate
suit
or
voluntary
dotage
of
some
mistress
convinced
or
supplied
them
cannot
choose
but
they
must
blab
hath
he
said
any
thing
he
hath
my
lord
but
be
you
well
assurd
no
more
than
hell
unswear
what
hath
he
said
faith
that
he
did
i
know
not
what
he
did
what
what
lie
with
her
with
her
on
her
what
you
will
lie
with
her
lie
on
her
we
say
lie
on
her
when
they
belie
her
lie
with
her
thats
fulsome
handkerchief
confessions
handkerchief
to
confess
and
be
hanged
for
his
labour
first
to
be
hanged
and
then
to
confess
i
tremble
at
it
nature
would
not
invest
herself
in
such
shadowing
passion
without
some
instruction
it
is
not
words
that
shake
me
thus
pish
noses
ears
and
lips
is
it
possible
confess
handkerchief
o
devil
work
on
my
medicine
work
thus
credulous
fools
are
caught
and
many
worthy
and
chaste
dames
even
thus
all
guitless
meet
reproach
what
ho
my
lord
my
lord
i
say
othello
how
now
cassio
whats
the
matter
my
lord
is
fallen
into
an
epilepsy
this
is
his
second
fit
he
had
one
yesterday
rub
him
about
the
temples
no
forbear
the
lethargy
must
have
his
quiet
course
if
not
he
foams
at
mouth
and
by
and
by
breaks
out
to
savage
madness
look
he
stirs
do
you
withdraw
yourself
a
little
while
he
will
recover
straight
when
he
is
gone
i
would
on
great
occasion
speak
with
you
how
is
it
general
have
you
not
hurt
your
head
dost
thou
mock
me
i
mock
you
no
by
heaven

bear
your
fortune
like
a
man

horned
mans
a
monster
and
a
beast

a
beast
then
in
a
populous
city
and
many
a
civil
monster

a
man
think
every
bearded
fellow
thats
but
yokd
may
draw
with
you
theres
millions
now
alive
that
nightly
lie
in
those
unproper
beds
which
they
dare
swear
peculiar
your
case
is
better
o
tis
the
spite
of
hell
the
fiends
archmock
to
lip
a
wanton
in
a
secure
couch
and
to
suppose
her
chaste
no
let
me
know
and
knowing
what
i
am
i
know
what
she
shall
be
o
thou
art
wise
tis
certain
stand
you
awhile
apart
confine
yourself
but
in
a
patient
list
whilst
you
were
here
oerwhelmed
with
your
grief
a
passion
most
unsuiting
such
a
man
cassio
came
hither
i
shifted
him
away
and
laid
good
scuse
upon
your
ecstasy
bade
him
anon
return
and
here
speak
with
me
the
which
he
promisd
do
but
encave
yourself
and
mark
the
fleers
the
gibes
and
notable
scorns
that
dwell
in
every
region
of
his
face
for
i
will
make
him
tell
the
tale
anew
where
how
how
oft
how
long
ago
and
when
he
hath
and
is
again

my
utmost
hopes

should
have
found
in

a
drop
of
patience
but
alas
to
make

no
life
the
fountain
from
the
which
my
current
runs
or

dries
up
to

go
to
o
good
iago
what
shall
i
do
to
win
my
lord
again
good
friend
go
to
him
for
by
this
light
of
heaven
i
know
not
how
i
lost
him
here
i
kneel
if
eer
my
will
did
trespass
gainst
his
love
either
in
discourse
of
thought
or
actual
deed
or
that
mine
eyes
mine
ears
or
any
sense
delighted
them
in
any
other
form
or
that
i
do
not
yet
and
ever
did
and
ever
will
though
he
do
shake
me
off
to
beggarly
divorcement
love
him
dearly
comfort
forswear
me
unkindness
may
do
much
and
his
unkindness
may
defeat
my
life
but
never
taint
my
love
i
cannot
say
whore
it
does
abhor
me
now
i
speak
the
word
to
do
the
act
that
might
the
addition
earn
not
the
worlds
mass
of
vanity
could
make
me
i
pray
you
be
content
tis
but
his
humour
the
business
of
the
state
does
him
offence
and
he
does
chide
with
you
if
twere
no
other
tis
but
so
i
warrant
hark
how
these
instruments
summon
to
supper
the
messengers
of
venice
stay
the
meat
go
in
and
weep
not
all
things
shall
be
well
how
now
roderigo
i
do
not
find
that
thou
dealest
justly
with
me
what
in
the
contrary
every
day
thou
daffest
me
with
some
device
iago
and
rather
as
it
seems
to
me
now
keepest
from
me
all
conveniency
than
suppliest
me
with
the
least
advantage
of
hope
i
will
indeed
no
longer
endure
it
nor
am
i
yet
persuaded
to
put
up
in
peace
what
already
i
have
foolishly
suffered
will
you
hear
me
roderigo
faith
i
have
heard
too
much
for
your
words
and
performances
are
no
kin
together
you
charge
me
most
unjustly
with
nought
but
truth
i
have
wasted
myself
out
of
my
means
the
jewels
you
have
had
from
me
to
deliver
to
desdemona
would
half
have
corrupted
a
votarist
you
have
told
me
she
has
received
them
and
returned
me
expectations
and
comforts
of
sudden
respect
and
acquaintance
but
i
find
none
well
go
to
very
well
very
well
go
to
i
cannot
go
to
man
nor
tis
not
very
well
by
this
hand
i
say
it
is
very
scurvy
and
begin
to
find
myself
fobbed
in
it
very
well
i
tell
you
tis
not
very
well
i
will
make
myself
known
to
desdemona
if
she
will
return
me
my
jewels
i
will
give
over
my
suit
and
repent
my
unlawful
solicitation
if
not
assure
yourself
i
will
seek
satisfaction
of
you
you
have
said
now
ay
and
said
nothing
but
what
i
protest
intendment
of
doing
why
now
i
see
theres
mettle
in
thee
and
even
from
this
instant
do
build
on
thee
a
better
opinion
than
ever
before
give
me
thy
hand
roderigo
thou
hast
taken
against
me
a
most
just
exception
but
yet
i
protest
i
have
dealt
most
directly
in
thy
affair
it
hath
not
appeared
i
grant
indeed
it
hath
not
appeared
and
your
suspicion
is
not
without
wit
and
judgment
but
roderigo
if
thou
hast
that
in
thee
indeed
which
i
have
greater
reason
to
believe
now
than
ever
i
mean
purpose
courage
and
valour
this
night
show
it
if
thou
the
next
night
following
enjoy
not
desdemona
take
me
from
this
world
with
treachery
and
devise
engines
for
my
life
well
what
is
it
is
it
within
reason
and
compass
sir
there
is
especial
commission
come
from
venice
to
depute
cassio
in
othellos
place

that
true
why
then
othello

desdemona
return
again
to
venice
o
no
he
goes
into
mauritania
and
takes
away
with
him
the
fair
desdemona
unless
his
abode
be
lingered
here
by
some
accident
wherein
none
can
be
so
determinate
as
the
removing
of
cassio
how
do
you
mean
removing
of
him
why
by
making
him
uncapable
of
othellos
place
knocking
out
his
brains
and
that
you
would
have
me
do
ay
if
you
dare
do
yourself
a
profit
and
a
right

amazed
at
it
but
go
along
with
me
i
will
show
you
such
a
necessity
in
his
death
that
you
shall
think
yourself
bound
to
put
it
on
him
it

now
high
suppertime
and
the
night
grows

good
night
mine
eyes
do
itch
doth
that
bode
weeping
tis
neither
here
nor
there
i
have
heard
it
said
so
o
these
men
these
men
dost
thou
in
conscience
think
tell
me
emilia
that
there
be
women
do
abuse
their
husbands
in
such
gross
kind
there
be
some
such
no
question
wouldst
thou
do
such
a
deed
for
all
the
world
why
would
not
you
no
by
this
heavenly
light
nor
i
neither
by
this
heavenly
light
might
do
t
as
well
i
the
dark
wouldst
thou
do
such
a
deed
for
all
the
world
the
world
is
a
huge
thing
tis
a
great
price
for
a
small
vice
in
troth
i
think
thou
wouldst
not
in
troth
i
think
i
should
and
undo
t
when
i
had
done
marry
i
would
not
do
such
a
thing
for
a
jointring
nor
measures
of
lawn
nor
for
gowns
petticoats
nor
caps
nor
any
petty
exhibition
but
for
the
whole
world
who
would
not
make
her
husband
a
cuckold
to
make
him
a
monarch
i
should
venture
purgatory
for
t
beshrew
me
if
i
would
do
such
a
wrong
for
the
whole
world
why
the
wrong
is
but
a
wrong
i
the
world
and
having
the
world
for
your
labour
tis
a
wrong
in
your
own
world
and
you
might
quickly
make
it
right
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
such
woman
yes
a
dozen
and
as
many
to
the
vantage
as
would
store
the
world
they
played
for
but
i
do
think
it
is
their
husbands
faults
if
wives
do
fall
say
that
they
slack
their
duties
and
pour
our
treasures
into
foreign
laps
or
else
break
out
in
peevish
jealousies
throwing
restraint
upon
us
or
say
they
strike
us
or
scant
our
former
having
in
despite
why
we
have
galls
and
though
we
have
some
grace
yet
have
we
some
revenge
let
husbands
know
their
wives
have
sense
like
them
they
see
and
smell
and
have
their
palates
both
for
sweet
and
sour
as
husbands
have
what
is
it
that
they
do
when
they
change
us
for
others
is
it
sport
i
think
it
is
and
doth
affection
breed
it
i
think
it
doth
is
t
frailty
that
thus
errs
it
is
so
too
and
have
not
we
affections
desires
for
sport
and
frailty
as
men
have
then
let
them
use
us
well
else
let
them
know
the
ills
we
do
their
ills
instruct
us
so
good
night
good
night
heaven
me
such
usage
send
not
to
pick
bad
from
bad
but
by
bad
mend
here
stand
behind

will
he
come
wear
thy
good
rapier
bare
and
put
it
home
quick
quick

thy
elbow

no
great
devotion
to

reasons

no
more
of
that
i
pray
you
in
your
letters
when
you
shall
these
unlucky
deeds
relate
speak
of
me
as
i
am
nothing
extenuate
nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
then
must
you
speak
of
one
that
lovd
not
wisely
but
too
well
of
one
not
easily
jealous
but
being
wrought
perplexd
in
the
extreme
of
one
whose
hand
like
the
base
indian
threw
a
pearl
away
richer
than
all
his
tribe
of
one
whose
subdud
eyes
albeit
unused
to
the
melting
mood
drop
tears
as
fast
as
the
arabian
trees
their
medcinable
gum
set
you
down
this
and
say
besides
that
in
aleppo
once
where
a
malignant
and
a
turband
turk
beat
a
venetian
and
traducd

state
i
took
by
the
throat
the
circumcised
dog

killing
myself
to
die
upon
a
kiss
this

i
fear
but
thought
he
had
no
weapon
for
he
was
great
of

romeo

two

both
alike
in

in

where
we
lay
our
scene
from
ancient
grudge
break
to
new
mutiny
where
civil
blood
makes
civil

unclean
from
forth
the
fatal

of
these
two
foes
a
pair
of
starcrossd
lovers
take
their

whose
misadventurd
piteous
overthrows
do
with

bury
their

and
the
continuance
of
their

rage

three
civil
brawls
bred
of
an
airy
word
by
thee
old
capulet
and
montague
have
thrice
disturbd
the
quiet
of
our
streets
and
made
veronas
ancient
citizens
cast
by
their
grave
beseeming
ornaments
to
wield
old
partisans
in
hands
as
old
cankerd
with
peace
to

your
cankerd
hate
if

time

who
set
this
ancient
quarrel
new
abroach
speak
nephew
were
you
by
when
it
began
here
were
the
servants
of
your
adversary
and
yours
close
fighting
ere
i
did
approach
i
drew
to
part
them
in
the
instant
came
the
fiery
tybalt
with
his
sword
prepard
which
as
he
breathd
defiance
to
my
ears
he
swung
about
his
head
and
cut
the
winds
who
nothing
hurt
withal
hissd
him
in
scorn
while
we
were
interchanging
thrusts
and
blows
came
more
and
more
and
fought
on
part
and
part
till
the
prince
came
who
parted
either
part
o
where
is
romeo
saw
you
him
today
right
glad
i
am
he
was
not
at
this
fray
madam
an
hour
before
the
worshippd
sun
peerd
forth
the
golden
window
of
the
east
a
troubled
mind
drave
me
to
walk
abroad
where
underneath
the
grove
of
sycamore
that
westward
rooteth
from
the
citys
side
so
early
walking
did
i
see
your
son
towards
him
i
made
but
he
was
ware
of
me
and
stole
into
the
covert
of
the
wood
i
measuring
his
affections
by
my
own
that
most
are
busied
when
theyre
most
alone
pursud
my
humour
not
pursuing
his
and
gladly
shunnd
who
gladly
fled
from
me
many
a
morning
hath
he
there
been
seen
with
tears
augmenting
the
fresh
mornings
dew
adding
to
clouds
more
clouds
with
his
deep
sighs
but
all
so
soon
as
the
allcheering
sun
should
in
the
furthest
east
begin
to
draw
the
shady
curtains
from
auroras
bed
away
from
light
steals
home
my
heavy
son
and
private
in
his
chamber
pens
himself
shuts
up
his
windows
locks
fair
daylight
out
and
makes
himself
an
artificial
night
black
and
portentous
must
this
humour
prove
unless
goodcounsel
may
the
cause
remove
my
noble
uncle
do
you
know
the
cause
i
neither
know
it
nor
can
learn
of
him
have
you
importund
him
by
any
means
both
by
myself
and
many
other
friends
but
he
his
own
affections
counsellor
is
to
himself
i
will
not
say
how
true
but
to
himself
so
secret
and
so
close
so
far
from
sounding
and
discovery
as
is
the
bud
bit
with
an
envious
worm
ere
he
can
spread
his
sweet
leaves
to
the
air
or
dedicate
his
beauty
to
the
sun
could
we
but
learn
from
whence
his
sorrows
grow
we
would
as
willingly
give
cure
as
know
see
where
he
comes
so
please
you
step
aside
ill
know
his
grievance
or
be
much
denied
i
would
thou
wert
so
happy
by
thy
stay
to
hear
true
shrift
come

fast

having
that
which
having
makes
them
short
in
love
out
of
love
out
of
her
favour
where
i
am
in
love
alas
that
love
so
gentle
in
his
view
should
be
so
tyrannous
and
rough
in
proof
alas
that
love
whose
view
is
muffled
still
should
without
eyes
see
pathways
to
his
will
where
shall
we
dine
o
me
what
fray
was
here

tell
me
not
for
i
have

strong
proof
of

well
armd
from

weak
childish
bow
she
lives
unharmd
she
will
not
stay
the
siege
of
loving
terms
nor
bide
the
encounter
of
assailing
eyes
nor
ope
her
lap
to
saintseducing
gold
o
she
is
rich
in
beauty
only
poor
that
when
she
dies
with
beauty
dies
her
store
then
she
hath
sworn
that
she
will
still
live
chaste

hath
and
in
that
sparing
makes
huge
waste
for
beauty
starvd
with
her
severity

beauty
off
from

way
to
call
hers
exquisite
in
question
more
these
happy
masks
that

fair
ladies
brows
being
black
put
us
in

the
precious
treasure
of
his
eyesight
lost
show
me
a
mistress
that

what
doth
her
beauty

that
passing
fair
farewell
thou
canst
not
teach
me
to
forget
ill

her
brow

ere

five
wits
and

in

masque
but

why
may
one
ask
i
dreamd
a
dream
tonight
and
so
did
i
well
what
was
yours
that
dreamers
often
lie
in
bed
asleep
while
they
do
dream
things
true
o
then
i
see
queen
mab
hath
been
with
you
queen
mab
whats
she
she
is
the
fairies
midwife
and
she
comes
in
shape
no
bigger
than
an
agatestone
on
the
forefinger
of
an
alderman
drawn
with
a
team
of
little
atomies
athwart
mens
noses
as
they
lie
asleep
her
waggonspokes
made
of
long
spinners
legs
the
cover
of
the
wings
of
grasshoppers
the
traces
of
the
smallest
spiders
web
the
collars
of
the
moonshines
watery
beams
her
whip
of
crickets
bone
the
lash
of
film
her
waggoner
a
small
greycoated
gnat
not
half
so
big
as
a
round
little
worm
prickd
from
the
lazy
finger
of
a
maid
her
chariot
is
an
empty
hazelnut
made
by
the
joiner
squirrel
or
old
grub
time
out
o
mind
the
fairies
coachmakers
and
in
this
state
she
gallops
night
by
night
through
lovers
brains
and
then
they
dream
of
love
oer
courtiers
knees
that
dream
on
curtsies
straight
oer
lawyers
fingers
who
straight
dream
on
fees
oer
ladies
lips
who
straight
on
kisses
dream
which
oft
the
angry
mab
with
blisters
plagues
because
their
breaths
with
sweetmeats
tainted
are
sometimes
she
gallops
oer
a
courtiers
nose
and
then
dreams
he
of
smelling
out
a
suit
and
sometimes
comes
she
with
a
tithe
pigs
tail
tickling
a
parsons
nose
as
a
lies
asleep
then
dreams
he
of
another
benefice
sometime
she
driveth
oer
a
soldiers
neck
and
then
dreams
he
of
cutting
foreign
throats
of
breaches
ambuscadoes
spanish
bladed
of
healths
five
fathom
deep
and
then
anon
drums
in
his
ear
at
which
he
starts
and
wakes
and
being
thus
frighted
swears
a
prayer
or
two
and
sleeps
again
this
is
that
very
mab
that
plats
the
manes
of
horses
in
the
night
and
bakes
the
elflocks
in
foul
sluttish
hairs
which
once
untangled
much
misfortune
bodes
this
is
the
hag
when
maids
lie
on
their
backs
that
presses
them
and
learns
them
first
to
bear
making
them
women
of
good
carriage
this
is
she
peace
peace
mercutio
peace
thou
talkst
of
nothing
true
i
talk
of
dreams
which
are
the
children
of
an
idle
brain
begot
of
nothing
but
vain
fantasy
which
is
as
thin
of
substance
as
the
air
and
more
inconstant
than
the
wind
who
woos
even
now
the
frozen
bosom
of
the
north
and
being
angerd
puffs
away
from
thence
turning
his
face
to
the
dewdropping
south
this
wind
you
talk
of
blows

from
ourselves
supper

come
too
late

fear
too
early

my
mind
misgives
some
consequence

hanging
in
the
stars

bitterly
begin
his
fearful
date
with
this
nights
revels
and
expire
the
term
of
a
despised
life
closd
in
my
breast
by
some
vile
forfeit
of
untimely
death

through
yonder
window

east
and
juliet

the
sun
arise
fair
sun
and
kill
the
envious
moon
who
is
already
sick
and
pale
with
grief
that
thou
her
maid
art
far
more
fair
than
she
be
not
her
maid
since
she
is
envious
her
vestal

sick
and
green
and
none
but
fools

my
lady
o
it

my
love
o
that

yet
she
says
nothing
what
of
that
her
eye
discourses
i
will
answer
it
i
am
too
bold
tis
not
to
me
she
speaks
two
of
the
fairest
stars
in
all
the
heaven
having
some
business
do
entreat
her
eyes
to
twinkle
in
their
spheres
till
they
return
what
if
her
eyes
were
there
they
in
her
head
the
brightness
of
her
cheek
would
shame
those
stars
as
daylight
doth
a
lamp
her
eyes
in
heaven
would
through
the
airy
region
stream
so
bright
that
birds
would
sing
and
think
it
were
not
night
see
how
she
leans
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
o
that
i
were
a
glove
upon
that
hand
that
i
might
touch
that
cheek
ay
me
she
speaks
o
speak
again
bright
angel
for
thou
art
as
glorious
to
this
night
being
oer
my
head
as
is
a
winged
messenger
of
heaven
unto
the
whiteupturned
wondring
eyes
of
mortals
that
fall
back
to
gaze
on
him
when
he
bestrides
the
lazypacing
clouds
and
sails
upon
the
bosom
of
the
air
o
romeo
romeo
wherefore
art
thou
romeo
deny
thy
father
and
refuse
thy
name
or
if
thou
wilt
not
be
but
sworn
my
love
and
ill
no
longer
be
a
capulet
shall
i
hear
more
or
shall
i
speak
at
this
tis
but
thy
name
that
is
my
enemy
thou
art
thyself
though
not
a
montague
whats
montague
it
is
nor
hand
nor
foot
nor
arm
nor
face
nor
any
other
part
belonging
to
a
man
o
be
some
other
name
whats
in
a
name
that
which
we
call
a
rose
by
any
other
name
would
smell
as
sweet
so
romeo
would
were
he
not
romeo
calld
retain
that
dear
perfection
which
he
owes
without
that
title
romeo
doff
thy
name
and
for
that
name
which
is
no
part
of
thee
take
all
myself
i
take
thee
at
thy
word
call
me
but
love
and
ill
be
new
baptizd
henceforth
i
never
will
be
romeo
what
man
art
thou
that
thus
bescreend
in
night
so
stumblest
on
my
counsel
by
a
name
i
know
not
how
to
tall
thee
who
i
am
my
name
dear
saint
is
hateful
to
myself
because
it
is
an
enemy
to
thee
had
i
it
written
i
would
tear
the
word
my
ears
have
not
yet
drunk
a
hundred
words
of
that
tongues
uttering
yet
i
know
the
sound
art
thou
not
romeo
and
a
montague
neither
fair
maid
if
either
thee
dislike
how
camst
thou
hither
tell
me
and
wherefore
the
orchard
walls
are
high
and
hard
to
climb
and
the
place
death
considering
who
thou
art
if
any
of
my
kinsmen
find
thee
here
with
loves
light
wings
did
i
oerperch
these
walls
for
stony
limits
cannot
hold
love
out
and
what
love
can
do
that
dares
love
attempt
therefore
thy
kinsmen
are
no
stop
to
me
if
they
do
see
thee
they
will
murder
thee
alack
there
lies
more
peril
in
thine
eye
than
twenty
of
their
swords
look
thou
but
sweet
and
i
am
proof
against
their
enmity
i
would
not
for
the
world
they
saw
thee
here
i
have
nights
cloak
to
hide
me
from
their
eyes
and
but
thou
love
me
let
them
find
me
here
my
life
were
better
ended
by
their
hate
than
death
prorogued
wanting
of
thy
love
by
whose
direction
foundst
thou
out
this
place
by
love
that
first
did
prompt
me
to
inquire
he
lent
me
counsel
and
i
lent
him
eyes
i
am
no
pilot
yet
wert
thou
as
far
as
that
vast
shore
washd
with
the
furthest
sea
i
would
adventure
for
such
merchandise
thou
knowst
the
mask
of
night
is
on
my
face
else
would
a
maiden
blush
bepaint
my
cheek
for
that
which
thou
hast
heard
me
speak
tonight
fain
would
i
dwell
on
form
fain
fain
deny
what
i
have
spoke
but
farewell
compliment
dost
thou
love
me
i
know
thou
wilt
say
ay
and
i
will
take
thy
word
yet
if
thou
swearst
thou
mayst
prove
false
at
lovers
perjuries
they
say
jove
laughs
o
gentle
romeo
if
thou
dost
love
pronounce
it
faithfully
or
if
thou
thinkst
i
am
too
quickly
won
ill
frown
and
be
perverse
and
say
thee
nay
so
thou
wilt
woo
but
else
not
for
the
world
in
truth
fair
montague
i
am
too
fond
and
therefore
thou
mayst
think
my
haviour
light
but
trust
me
gentleman
ill
prove
more
true
than
those
that
have
more
cunning
to
be
strange
i
should
have
been
more
strange
i
must
confess
but
that
thou
overheardst
ere
i
was
ware
my
true
loves
passion
therefore
pardon
me
and
not
impute
this
yielding
to
light
love
which
the
dark
night
hath
so
discovered
lady
by
yonder
blessed
moon
i
swear
that
tips
with
silver
all
these
fruittree
tops
o
swear
not
by
the
moon
the
inconstant
moon
that
monthly
changes
in
her
circled
orb
lest
that
thy
love
prove
likewise
variable
what
shall
i
swear
by
do
not
swear
at
all
or
if
thou
wilt
swear
by
thy
gracious
self
which
is
the
god
of
my
idolatry
and
ill
believe
thee
if
my
hearts
dear
love
well
do
not
swear
although
i
joy
in
thee
i
have
no
joy
of
this
contract
tonight
it
is
too
rash
too
unadvisd
too
sudden
too
like
the
lightning
which
doth
cease
to
be
ere
one
can
say
it
lightens
sweet
goodnight
this
bud
of
love
by
summers
ripening
breath
may
prove
a
beauteous
flower
when
next
we
meet
goodnight
goodnight
as
sweet
repose
and
rest
come
to
thy
heart
as
that
within
my
breast
o
wilt
thou
leave
me
so
unsatisfied
what
satisfaction
canst
thou
have
tonight
the
exchange
of
thy
loves
faithful
vow
for
mine
i
gave
thee
mine
before
thou
didst
request
it
and
yet
i
would
it
were
to
give
again
wouldst
thou
withdraw
it
for
what
purpose
love
but
to
be
frank
and
give
it
thee
again
and
yet
i
wish
but
for
the
thing
i
have
my
bounty
is
as
boundless
as
the
sea
my
love
as
deep
the
more
i
give
to
thee
the
more
i
have
for
both
are
infinite
i

some
noise
within

a
thousand
times
the
worse
to

thy
light
love

toward

as
schoolboys
from
their
books
but
love
from
love
toward
school
with
heavy
looks
hist
romeo
hist
o
for
a
falconers
voice
to
lure
this
tasselgentle
back
again
bondage
is
hoarse
and
may
not
speak
aloud
else
would
i
tear
the
cave
where
echo
lies
and
make
her
airy
tongue
more
hoarse
than
mine
with
repetition
of
my
romeos
name
it
is
my
soul
that
calls
upon
my
name
how
silversweet
sound
lovers
tongues
by
night
like
softest
music
to
attending
ears
romeo
my
dear
at
what
oclock
tomorrow
shall
i
send
to
thee
at
the
hour
of
nine
i
will
not
fail
tis
twenty
years
till
then
i
have
forgot
why
i
did
call
thee
back
let
me
stand
here
till
thou
remember
it
i
shall
forget
to
have
thee
still
stand
there
remembering
how
i
love
thy
company
and
ill
still
stay
to
have
thee
still
forget
forgetting
any
other
home
but
this
tis
almost
morning
i
would
have
thee
gone
and
yet
no
further
than
a
wantons
bird
who
lets
it
hop
a
little
from
her
hand
like
a
poor
prisoner
in
his
twisted
gyves
and
with
a
silk
thread
plucks
it
back
again
so
lovingjealous
of
his
liberty
i
would
i
were
thy
bird
sweet
so
would
i
yet
i
should
kill
thee
with
much
cherishing
goodnight
goodnight
parting
is
such
sweet
sorrow
that
i
shall
say
goodnight
till
it
be
morrow
sleep
dwell
upon
thine
eyes
peace
in
thy
breast
would
i
were
sleep
and
peace
so
sweet
to
rest
hence
will
i
to
my
ghostly
fathers
cell
his
help
to
crave
and
my
dear
hap
to
tell
the
greyeyd
morn
smiles
on
the
frowning
night
chequering
the
eastern
clouds
with
streaks
of
light
and
flecked
darkness
like
a
drunkard
reels
from
forth
days
path
and
titans
fiery
wheels
now
ere
the
sun
advance
his
burning
eye
the
day
to
cheer
and
nights
dank
dew
to
dry
i
must
upfill
this
osier
cage
of
ours
with
baleful
weeds
and
preciousjuiced
flowers
the
earth
thats

lo
here
upon

romeo
have
you
got
leave
to
go
to
shrift
today
i
have
then
hie
you
hence
to
friar
laurence
cell
there
stays
a
husband
to
make
you
a
wife
now

wanton
blood

in
your
cheeks
theyll
be
in
scarlet
straight
at
any
news
hie
you
to
church
i
must
another
way
to
fetch
a
ladder
by
the
which
your
love
must
climb
a
birds
nest
soon
when
it
is
dark
i
am
the
drudge
and
toil
in
your
delight
but
you
shall
bear
the
burden
soon
at
night
go
ill
to
dinner
hie
you
to
the
cell
hie
to
high
fortune
honest
nurse
farewell
so
smile
the
heaven
upon
this
holy
act
that
after
hours
with
sorrow
chide
us
not
amen
amen
but
come
what
sorrow
can
it
cannot
countervail
the
exchange
of
joy
that
one
short
minute
gives
me
in
her
sight
do
thou
but
close
our
hands
with
holy
words
then
lovedevouring
death
do
what
he
dare
it
is
enough
i
may
but
call
her
mine
these
violent
delights
have
violent
ends
and
in
their
triumph
die
like
fire
and
powder
which
as
they
kiss
consume
the
sweetest
honey
is
loathsome
in
his
own
deliciousness
and
in
the
taste
confounds
the
appetite
therefore
love
moderately
long
love
doth
so
too
swift
arrives
as
tardy
as
too
slow
here
comes
the
lady
o
so
light
a
foot
will
neer
wear
out
the
everlasting
flint
a
lover
may
bestride
the
gossamer
that
idles
in
the
wanton
summer
air
and
yet
not
fall
so
light
is
vanity
good
even
to
my
ghostly
confessor
romeo
shall
thank
thee
daughter
for
us
both
as
much
to
him
else
are
his
thanks
too
much
ah
juliet
if
the
measure
of
thy
joy
be
heapd
like
mine
and
that
thy
skill
be
more
to
blazon
it
then
sweeten
with
thy
breath
this
neighbour
air
and
let
rich
musics
tongue
unfold
the
imagind
happiness
that
both
receive
in
either
by
this
dear
encounter
conceit
more
rich
in
matter
than
in
words
brags
of
his
substance
not
of
ornament
they
are
but
beggars
that
can
count
their
worth
but
my
true
love
is
grown
to
such
excess
i
cannot
sum
up
half
my
sum
of
wealth
come
come
with
me
and
we
will
make
short
work
for
by
your
leaves
you
shall
not
stay
alone
till
holy
church
incorporate
two
in
one
i
pray
thee
good
mercutio
lets
retire
the
day
is
hot
the
capulets
abroad
and
if
we
meet
we
shall
not
scape
a
brawl
for
now
these
hot
days
is
the
mad
blood
stirring
thou
art
like
one
of
those
fellows
that
when
he
enters
the
confines
of
a
tavern
claps
me
his
sword
upon
the
table
and
says
god
send
me
no
need
of
thee
and
by
the
operation
of
the
second
cup
draws
him
on
the
drawer
when
indeed
there
is
no
need
am
i
like
such
a
fellow
come
come
thou
art
as
hot
a
jack
in
thy
mood
as
any
in
italy
and
as
soon
moved
to
be
moody
and
as
soon
moody
to
be
moved
and
what
to
nay
an
there
were
two
such
we
should
have
none
shortly
for
one
would
kill
the
other
thou
why
thou
wilt
quarrel
with
a
man
that
hath
a
hair
more
or
a
hair
less
in
his
beard
than
thou
hast
thou
wilt
quarrel
with
a
man
for
cracking
nuts
having
no
other
reason
but
because
thou
hast
hazel
eyes
what
eye
but
such
an
eye
would
spy
out
such
a
quarrel
thy
head
is
as
full
of
quarrels
as
an
egg
is
full
of
meat
and
yet
thy
head
hath
been
beaten
as
addle
as
an
egg
for
quarrelling
thou
hast
quarrelled
with
a
man
for
coughing
in
the
street
because
he
hath
wakened
thy
dog
that
hath
lain
asleep
in
the
sun
didst
thou
not
fall
out
with
a
tailor
for
wearing
his
new
doublet
before
easter
with
another
for
tying
his
new
shoes
with
old
riband
and
yet
thou
wilt
tutor
me
from
quarrelling

i
were
so
apt
to
quarrel
as
thou
art
any
man

buy
the
feesimple
of
my

where
are
the
vile
beginners
of
this
fray
o
noble
prince
i
can
discover
all
the
unlucky
manage
of
this
fatal
brawl
there
lies
the
man
slain
by
young
romeo
that
slew
thy
kinsman
brave
mercutio
tybalt
my
cousin
o
my
brothers
child
o
prince
o
cousin
husband
o
the
blood
is
spilld
of
my
dear
kinsman
prince
as
thou
art
true
for
blood
of
ours
shed
blood
of
montague
o
cousin
cousin
benvolio
who
began
this
bloody
fray
tybalt
here
slain
whom
romeos
hand
did
slay
romeo
that
spoke
him
fair
bade
him
bethink
how
nice
the
quarrel
was
and
urgd
withal
your
high
displeasure
all
this
uttered
with
gentle
breath
calm
look
knees
humbly
bowd
could
not
take
truce
with
the
unruly
spleen
of
tybalt
deaf
to
peace
but
that
he
tilts
with
piercing
steel
at
bold
mercutios
breast
who
all
as
hot
turns
deadly
point
to
point
and
with
a
martial
scorn
with
one
hand
beats
cold
death
aside
and
with
the
other
sends
it
back
to
tybalt
whose
dexterity
retorts
it
romeo
he
cries
aloud
hold
friends
friends
part
and
swifter
than
his
tongue
his
agile
arm
beats
down
their
fatal
points
and
twixt
them
rushes
underneath
whose
arm
an
envious
thrust
from
tybalt
hit
the
life
of
stout
mercutio
and
then
tybalt
fled
but
by
and
by
comes
back
to
romeo
who
had
but
newly
entertaind
revenge
and
to
t
they
go
like
lightning
for
ere
i
could
draw
to
part
them
was
stout
tybalt
slain
and
as
he
fell
did
romeo
turn
and
fly
this
is
the
truth
or
let
benvolio
die
he
is
a
kinsman
to
the
montague
affection
makes
him
false
he
speaks
not
true
some
twenty
of
them
fought
in
this
black
strife
and
all
those
twenty
could
but
kill
one
life
i
beg
for
justice
which
thou
prince
must
give
romeo
slew
tybalt
romeo
must
not
live
romeo
slew
him
he
slew
mercutio
who
now
the
price
of
his
dear
blood
doth
owe
not
romeo
prince
he
was
mercutios
friend
his
fault
concludes
but
what
the
law
should
end
the
life
of
tybalt
and
for
that
offence
immediately
we
do
exile
him
hence
i
have
an
interest
in
your
hates
proceeding
my
blood
for
your
rude
brawls
doth
lie
ableeding
but
ill
amerce
you
with
so
strong
a
fine
that
you
shall
all
repent
the
loss
of
mine
i
will
be
deaf
to
pleading
and
excuses
nor
tears
nor
prayers
shall
purchase
out
abuses
therefore
use
none
let
romeo
hence
in
haste
else
when
hes
found
that
hour
is
his
last
bear
hence
this
body
and
attend
our

thy
close
curtain

that
runaways
eyes
may

leap
to
these
arms
untalkd
of
and
unseen
lovers

see
to
do
their
amorous
rites
by

thou
hast
vowd
to
cherish
thy
wit
that
ornament
to

and
love
misshapen
in
the
conduct
of
them
both
like
powder
in
a
skilless
soldiers
flask
to
set
afire

thine

it
to
exile
there

a
pack
of
blessings

happiness
courts
thee
in
her
best
array

the
fearful
hollow
of
thine
ear
nightly
she
sings
on
you
pomegranate
tree
believe
me
love
it
was
the
nightingale
it
was
the
lark
the
herald
of
the
morn
no
nightingale
look
love
what
envious
streaks
do
lace
the
severing
clouds
in
yonder
east
nights
candles
are
burnt
out
and
jocund
day
stands
tiptoe
on
the
misty
mountain
tops
i
must
be
gone
and
live
or
stay
and
die
yon
light
is
not
daylight
i
know
it
i
it
is
some
meteor
that
the
sun
exhales
to
be
to
thee
this
night
a
torchbearer
and
light
thee
on
thy
way
to
mantua
therefore
stay
yet
thou
needst
not
to
be
gone
let
me
be
taen
let
me
be
put
to
death
i
am
content
so
thou
wilt
have
it
so
ill
say
yon
grey
is
not
the
mornings
eye
tis
but
the
pale
reflex
of
cynthias
brow
nor
that
is
not
the
lark
whose
notes
do
beat
the
vaulty
heaven
so
high
above
our
heads
i
have
more
care
to
stay
than
will
to
go
come
death
and
welcome
juliet
wills
it
so
how
ist
my
soul
lets
talk
it
is
not
day
it
is
it
is
hie
hence
be
gone
away
it
is
the
lark
that
sings
so
out
of
tune
straining
harsh
discords
and
unpleasing
sharps
some
say
the
lark
makes
sweet
division
this
doth
not
so
for
she
divideth
us
some
say
the
lark
and
loathed
toad
change
eyes
o
now
i
would
they
had
changd
voices
too
since
arm
from
arm
that
voice
doth
us
affray
hunting

hence
with
huntsup
to
the
day
o
now

grows
more
light

well
evermore
weeping
for
your
cousins

what
wilt
thou
wash
him
from
his
grave
with
tears
and
if

couldst
not
make
him
live
therefore
have
done
some
grief

much
of
love

much
of
grief

still
some
want
of
wit

let
me
weep
for
such
a
feeling
loss

shall
you
feel
the
loss

the
loss
i
cannot
choose
but
ever
weep
the
friend

many
miles
asunder

an
unaccustomd
dram
that

be
satisfied
indeed
i
never
shall
be
satisfied
with

is
my
poor
heart
so
for
a
kinsman
vexd

if

temper
it
that

sleep
in
quiet
o
how
my

to
hear

namd
and

which
i
may
call
the
sea
do
ebb
and
flow
with
tears
the
bark
thy
body
is
sailing
in
this
salt
flood
the
winds
thy
sighs
who
raging
with
thy
tears
and
they
with
them
without
a
sudden
calm
will
overset
thy
tempesttossed

banished
and
all
the
world
to
nothing
that
he
dares
neer
come
back
to
challenge
you
or
if
he
do
it
needs
must
be
by
stealth
then
since
the
case
so
stands
as
now
it
doth
i
think
it
best
you
married
with
the
county
o
hes
a
lovely
gentleman
romeos
a
dishclout
to
him
an
eagle
madam
hath
not
so
green
so
quick
so
fair
an
eye
as
paris
hath
beshrew
my
very
heart
i
think
you
are
happy
in
this
second
match
for
it
excels
your
first
or
if
it
did
not
your
first
is
dead
or
twere
as
good
he
were
as
living
here
and
you
no
use
of
him
speakest
thou
from
thy
heart
and
from
my
soul
too
or
else
beshrew
them
both
amen
what
well
thou
hast
comforted
me
marvellous
much
go
in
and
tell
my
lady
i
am
gone
having
displeasd
my
father
to
laurence
cell
to
make
confession
and
to
be
absolvd
marry
i
will
and
this
is
wisely
done
ancient
damnation
o
most
wicked
fiend
is
it
more
sin
to
wish
me
thus
forsworn
or
to
dispraise
my
lord
with
that
same
tongue
which
she
hath
praisd
him
with
above
compare
so
many
thousand
times
go
counsellor
thou

my
bosom
henceforth
shall
be
twain

to
die
on
thursday

the
time

very
short
my
father
capulet

have
it
so
and
i
am
nothing
slow
to
slack
his
haste
you
say
you
do
not
know
the
ladys
mind
uneven
is
the
course
i
like
it
not
immoderately
she
weeps
for
tybalts
death
and
therefore
have
i
little
talkd
of
love
for
venus
smiles
not
in
a
house
of
tears
now
sir
her
father
counts
it
dangerous
that
she
doth
give
her
sorrow
so
much
sway
and
in
his
wisdom
hastes
our
marriage
to
stop
the
inundation
of
her
tears
which
too
much
minded
by
herself
alone
may
be
put
from
her
by
society
now
do
you
know
the
reason
of
this
haste
i
would
i
knew
not
why
it
should
be
slowd
look
sir
here
comes
the
lady
towards
my
cell

love
him

will
ye
i
am
sure
that
you
love
me
if
i
do
so
it
will
be
of
more
price
being
spoke
behind
your
back
than
to
your
face
poor
soul
thy
face
is
much
abusd
with
tears
the
tears
have
got
small
victory
by
that
for
it
was
bad
enough
before
their
spite
thou
wrongst
it
more
than
tears
with
that
report
that
is
no
slander
sir
which
is
a
truth
and
what
i
spake
i
spake
it
to
my
face
thy
face
is
mine
and
thou
hast
slanderd
it
it
may
be
so
for
it
is
not
mine

this
holy
kiss
o
shut
the

when
thou

with
me
past
hope
past
cure
past
help
ah
juliet
i
already
know
thy
grief
it
strains
me
past
the
compass
of
my
wits
i
hear
thou
must
and
nothing
may
prorogue
it
on
thursday
next
be
married
to
this
county
tell
me
not
friar
that
thou
hearst
of
this
unless
thou
tell
me
how
i
may
prevent
it
if
in
thy
wisdom
thou
canst
give
no
help
do
thou
but
call
my
resolution
wise
and
with
this
knife
ill
help
it
presently
god
joind
my
heart
and
romeos
thou
our
hands
and
ere
this
hand
by
thee
to
romeo
seald
shall
be
the
label
to
another
deed
or
my
true
heart
with
treacherous
revolt
turn
to
another
this
shall
slay
them
both
therefore
out
of
thy
longexperiencd
time
give
me
some
present
counsel
or
behold
twixt
my
extremes
and
me
this
bloody
knife
shall
play
the
umpire
arbitrating
that
which
the
commission
of
thy
years
and
art
could
to
no
issue
of
true
honour
bring
be
not
so
long
to
speak
i
long
to
die
if
what
thou
speakst
speak
not
of
remedy
hold
daughter
i
do
spy
a
kind
of
hope
which
craves
as
desperate
an
execution
as
that
is
desperate
which
we
would
prevent
if
rather
than
to
marry
county
paris
thou
hast
the
strength
of
will
to
slay
thyself
then
is
it
likely
thou
wilt
undertake
a
thing
like
death
to
chide
away
this
shame
that
copst
with
death
himself
to
scape
from
it
and
if
thou
darst
ill
give
thee
remedy
o
bid
me
leap
rather
than
marry
paris
from
off
the
battlements
of
yonder
tower
or
walk
in
thievish
ways
or
bid
me
lurk
where
serpents
are
chain
me
with
roaring
bears
or
shut
me
nightly
in
a
charnelhouse
oercoverd
quite
with
dead
mens
rattling
bones
with
reeky
shanks
and
yellow
chapless
skulls
or
bid
me
go
into
a
newmade
grave
and
hide
me
with
a
dead
man
in
his
shroud
things
that
to
hear
them
told
have
made
me
tremble
and
i
will
do
it
without
fear
or
doubt
to
live
an
unstaind
wife
to
my
sweet
love
hold
then
go
home
be
merry
give
consent
to
marry
paris
wednesday
is
tomorrow
tomorrow
night
look
that
thou
lie
alone
let
not
thy
nurse
lie
with
thee
in
thy
chamber
take
thou
this
vial
being
then
in
bed
and
this
distilled
liquor
drink
thou
off
when
presently
through
all
thy
veins
shall
run
a
cold
and
drowsy
humour
for
no
pulse
shall
keep
his
native
progress
but
surcease
no
warmth
no
breath
shall
testify
thou
livst
the
roses
in
thy
lips
and
cheeks
shall
fade
to
paly
ashes
thy
eyes
windows
fall
like
death
when
he
shuts
up
the
day
of
life
each
part
deprivd
of
supple
government
shall
stiff
and
stark
and
cold
appear
like
death
and
in
this
borrowd
likeness
of
shrunk
death
thou
shalt
continue
twoandforty
hours
and
then
awake
as
from
a
pleasant
sleep
now
when
the
bridegroom
in
the
morning
comes
to
rouse
thee
from
thy
bed
there
art
thou
dead
then
as
the
manner
of
our
country
is
in
thy
best
robes
uncoverd
on
the
bier
thou
shalt
be
borne
to
that
same
ancient
vault
where
all
the
kindred
of
the
capulets
lie
in
the
mean
time
against
thou
shalt
awake
shall
romeo
by
my
letters
know
our
drift
and
hither
shall
he
come
and
he
and
i
will
watch
thy
waking
and
that
very
night
shall
romeo
bear
thee
hence
to
mantua
and
this
shall
free
thee
from
this
present
shame
if
no
unconstant
toy
nor
womanish
fear
abate
thy
valour
in
the
acting
it
give
me
give
me
o
tell
me
not
of
fear
hold
get
you
gone
be
strong
and
prosperous
in
this
resolve
ill
send
a
friar
with
speed
to
mantua
with
my
letters
to
thy
lord

give
me
strength
and
strength
shall

god

the
heat
of
life
ill
call

to
comfort
me
nurse
what

my
dismal

work
at

shall
i
be
married
then
tomorrow
morning
no
no
this
shall
forbid
it
lie
thou
there
what
if
it
be
a
poison
which
the
friar
subtly
hath
ministerd
to
have
me
dead
lest
in
this
marriage
he
should
be
dishonourd
because
he
married
me
before
to
romeo
i
fear
it
is
and
yet
methinks
it
should
not
for
he
hath
still
been
tried
a
holy
man
i
will
not
entertain
so
bad
a
thought
how
if
when
i
am
laid
into
the
tomb
i
wake
before
the
time
that
romeo
come
to
redeem
me
theres
a
fearful
point
shall
i
not
then
be
stifled
in
the
vault
to
whose
foul
mouth
no
healthsome
air
breathes
in
and
there
die
strangled
ere
my
romeo
comes
or
if
i
live
is
it
not
very
like
the
horrible
conceit
of
death
and
night
together
with
the
terror
of
the
place
as
in
a
vault
an
ancient
receptacle
where
for
these
many
hundred
years
the
bones
of
all
my
buried
ancestors
are
packd
where
bloody
tybalt
yet
but
green
in
earth
lies
festering
in
his
shroud
where
as
they
say
at
some
hours
in
the
night
spirits
resort
alack
alack
is
it
not
like
that
i
so
early
waking
what
with
loathsome
smells
and
shrieks
like
mandrakes
torn
out
of
the
earth
that
living
mortals
hearing
them
run
mad
o
if
i
wake
shall
i
not
be
distraught
environed
with
all
these
hideous
fears
and
madly
play
with
my
forefathers
joints
and
pluck
the
mangled
tybalt
from
his
shroud
and
in
this
rage
with
some
great
kinsmans
bone
as
with
a
club
dash
out
my
desperate
brains
o
look
methinks
i
see
my
cousins
ghost
seeking
out
romeo
that
did
spit
his
body
upon
a
rapiers
point

stay

apothecary

hereabouts
he
dwells
which
late
i
noted
in
tatterd
weeds
with
overwhelming
brows
culling
of
simples
meagre
were
his
looks
sharp
misery
had
worn
him
to
the
bones
and
in
his
needy
shop
a
tortoise
hung
an
alligator
stuffd
and
other
skins
of
illshapd
fishes
and
about
his
shelves
a
beggarly
account
of
empty
boxes
green
earthen
pots
bladders
and
musty
seeds
remnants
of
packthread
and
old
cakes
of
roses
were
thinly
scatterd
to
make
up
a
show
noting
this
penury
to
myself
i
said
an
if
a
man
did
need
a
poison
now
whose
sale
is
present

caitiff
wretch

thought

my
need

needy
man

sell
it

a
dram
of

soonspeeding
gear

will
disperse
itself
through
all
the
veins
that
the
lifeweary
taker
may
fall
dead
and
that
the
trunk
may
be
dischargd
of
breath
as
violently
as
hasty
powder
fird
doth
hurry
from
the
fatal
cannons
womb
such
mortal
drugs

a
barefoot
brother
out
one
of
our
order
to
associate
me
here
in
this
city
visiting
the
sick
and
finding
him
the
searchers
of
the
town
suspecting
that
we
both
were
in
a
house
where
the
infectious
pestilence
did
reign
seald
up
the
doors
and
would
not
let
us
forth
so
that
my
speed
to
mantua
there
was
stayd
who
bare
my
letter
then
to
romeo
i
could
not
send
it
here
it
is
again
nor
get
a
messenger
to
bring
it
thee
so
fearful
were
they
of
infection
unhappy
fortune
by
my
brotherhood
the
letter
was
not
nice
but
full
of
charge
of
dear
import
and

neglecting
it
may
do
much
danger

iron

i
to
the
monument
alone
within
these
three
hours
will
fair
juliet
wake
she
will
beshrew
me
much
that
romeo
hath
had
no
notice
of
these
accidents

will
write
again
to

keep
her
at
my
cell

corse
closd
in
a
dead
mans
tomb
give
me
thy
torch
boy
hence
and
stand
aloof
yet
put
it
out
for
i
would
not
be
seen
under
yond
yewtrees
lay
thee
all
along
holding
thine
ear
close
to
the
hollow
ground
so
shall
no
foot
upon
the
churchyard
tread
being
loose
unfirm
with
digging
up
of
graves
but
thou
shalt
hear
it
whistle
then
to
me
as
signal
that
thou
hearst
something
approach
give
me
those
flowers
do
as
i
bid
thee
go
i
am
almost
afraid
to
stand
alone
here
in
the
churchyard
yet
i
will
adventure
sweet
flower
with
flowers
thy
bridal
bed
i
strew
o
woe
thy
canopy
is
dust
and
stones
which
with
sweet
water
nightly
i
will
dew
or
wanting
that
with
tears
distilld
by
moans
the
obsequies
that
i
for
thee
will
keep
nightly
shall
be
to
strew
thy
grave
and
weep
the
boy
gives
warning
something
doth
approach
what
cursed
foot
wanders
this
way
tonight
to
cross
my
obsequies
and
true
loves
rite
what
with
a
torch
muffle
me
night
awhile
give
me
that
mattock
and
the
wrenching
iron
hold
take
this
letter
early
in
the
morning
see
thou
deliver
it
to
my
lord
and
father
give
me
the
light
upon
thy
life
i
charge
thee
whateer
thou
hearst
or
seest
stand
all
aloof
and
do
not
interrupt
me
in
my
course
why
i
descend
into
this
bed
of
death
is
partly
to
behold
my
ladys
face
but
chiefly
to
take
thence
from
her
dead
finger
a
precious
ring
a
ring
that
i
must
use
in
dear
employment
therefore
hence
be
gone
but
if
thou
jealous
dost
return
to
pry
in
what
i
further
shall
intend
to
do
by
heaven
i
will
tear
thee
joint
by
joint
and
strew
this
hungry
churchyard
with
thy
limbs
the
time
and
my
intents
are
savagewild
more
fierce
and
more
inexorable
far
than
empty
tigers
or
the
roaring
sea
i
will
be
gone
sir
and
not
trouble
you
so
shalt
thou
show
me
friendship
take
thou
that
live
and
be
prosperous
and
farewell
good
fellow
for
all
this
same
ill
hide
me
here
about
his
looks
i
fear
and
his
intents
i
doubt
thou
detestable
maw
thou
womb
of
death
gorgd
with
the
dearest
morsel
of
the
earth
thus
i
enforce
thy
rotten
jaws
to

and
in
despite
ill
cram
thee
with
more
food
this
is
that
banishd
haughty
montague
that

with
which
grief

how
oft
when

that
the

abhorred
monster

to
be
his
paramour
for
fear
of

still
will
stay

and
new
killd

here
is
a
friar
and
slaughterd
romeos
man
with
instruments
upon
them
fit
to
open
these
dead
mens
tombs
o
heaven
o
wife
look
how
our
daughter
bleeds
this
dagger
hath
mistaen
for
lo
his
house
is
empty
on
the
back
of
montague
and
is
missheathed
in
my
daughters
bosom
o
me
this
sight
of
death
is
as
a
bell
that
warns
my
old
age
to
a
sepulchre
come
montague
for
thou
art
early
up
to
see
thy
son
and
heir
more
early
down
alas
my
liege
my
wife
is
dead
tonight
grief
of
my
sons
exile
hath
stoppd
her
breath
what
further
woe
conspires
against
mine
age
look
and
thou
shalt
see
o
thou
untaught
what
manners
is
in
this
to
press
before
thy
father
to
a
grave
seal
up
the
mouth
of
outrage
for
a
while
till
we
can
clear
these
ambiguities
and
know
their
spring
their
head
their
true
descent
and
then
will
i
be
general
of
your
woes
and
lead
you
even
to
death
meantime
forbear
and
let
mischance
be
slave
to
patience
bring
forth
the
parties
of
suspicion
i
am
the
greatest
able
to
do
least
yet
most
suspected
as
the
time
and
place
doth
make
against
me
of
this
direful
murder
and
here
i
stand
both
to
impeach
and
purge
myself
condemned
and
myself
excusd
then
say
at
once
what
thou
dost
know
in
this
i
will
be
brief
for
my
short
date
of
breath
is
not
so
long
as
is
a
tedious
tale
romeo
there
dead
was
husband
to
that
juliet
and
she
there
dead
that
romeos
faithful
wife
i
married
them
and
their
stolen
marriageday
was
tybalts
doomsday
whose
untimely
death
banishd
the
newmade
bridegroom
from
this
city
for
whom
and
not
for
tybalt
juliet
pind
you
to
remove
that
siege
of
grief
from
her
betrothd
and
would
have
married
her
perforce
to
county
paris
then
comes
she
to
me
and
with
wild
looks
bid
me
devise
some
mean
to
rid
her
from
this
second
marriage
or
in
my
cell
there
would
she
kill
herself
then
gave
i
her
so
tutord
by
my
art
a
sleeping
potion
which
so
took
effect
as
i
intended
for
it
wrought
on
her
the
form
of
death
meantime
i
writ
to
romeo
that
he
should
hither
come
as
this
dire
night
to
help
to
take
her
from
her
borrowd
grave
being
the
time
the
potions
force
should
cease
but
he
which
bore
my
letter
friar
john
was
stayd
by
accident
and
yesternight
returnd
my
letter
back
then
all
alone
at
the
prefixed
hour
of
her
waking
came
i
to
take
her
from
her
kindreds
vault
meaning
to
keep
her
closely
at
my
cell
till
i
conveniently
could
send
to
romeo
but
when
i
came
some
minute
ere
the
time
of
her
awakening
here
untimely
lay
the
noble
paris
and
true
romeo
dead
she
wakes
and
i
entreated
her
come
forth
and
bear
this
work
of
heaven
with
patience
but
then
a
noise
did
scare
me
from
the
tomb
and
she
too
desperate
would
not
go
with
me
but
as
it
seems
did
violence
on
herself
all
this
i
know
and
to
the
marriage
her
nurse
is
privy
and
if
aught
in
this
miscarried
by
my
fault
let
my
old
life
be
sacrificd
some
hour
before
his
time
unto
the
rigour
of
severest
law
we
still
have
known
thee
for
a
holy
man
wheres
romeos
man
what
can
he
say
in
this
i
brought
my
master
news
of
juliets
death
and
then
in
post
he
came
from
mantua
to
this
same
place
to
this
same
monument
this
letter
he
early
bid
me
give
his
father
and
threatend
me
with
death
going
in
the
vault
if
i
departed
not
and
left
him
there
give
me
the
letter

will
look
on
it
where
is
the
countys
page

your
master
in
this
place

well
known
but
what
particular
rarity

strange
which
manifold
record
not
matches
see
magic
of
bounty
all
these
spirits
thy
power
hath
conjurd
to
attend
i
know
the
merchant
i
know
them
both
th
others
a
jeweller
o
tis
a
worthy
lord
nay
thats
most
fixd
a
most
incomparable
man
breathd
as

were
to
an
untirable
and
continuate
goodness
he
passes
i
have
a
jewel
here
o
pray
lets
see
t
for
the
lord
timon
sir
if
he
will
touch
the
estimate
but
for
that
when
we
for
recompense
have
praisd
the
vile
it
stains
the
glory
in
that
happy
verse
which
aptly
sings
the
good
tis
a
good
form
and
rich
here
is
a
water
look
ye
you
are
rapt
sir
in
some
work
some
dedication
to
the
great
lord
a
thing
slippd
idly
from
me
our
poesy
is
as
a
gum
which
oozes
from
whence
tis
nourishd
the
fire
i
the
flint
shows
not
till
it
be
struck
our
gentle
flame
provokes
itself
and
like
the
current
flies
each
bound
it
chafes
what
have
you
there
a
picture
sir
when
comes
your
book
forth
upon
the
heels
of
my
presentment
sir
lets
see
your
piece
tis
a
good
piece
so
tis
this
comes
off
well
and
excellent
indifferent
admirable
how
this
grace
speaks
his
own
standing
what
a
mental
power
this
eye
shoots
forth
how
big
imagination
moves
in
this
lip
to
the
dumbness
of
the
gesture
one
might
interpret
it
is
a
pretty
mocking
of
the
life
here
is
a
touch
is
t
good
ill
say
of
it
it
tutors
nature
artificial
strife
lives
in
these
touches
livelier
than
life
how
this
lord
is
followd
the
senators
of
athens
happy
man
look
more
you
see
this
confluence
this
great
flood
of
visitors
i
have
in
this
rough
work
shapd
out
a
man
whom
this
beneath
world
doth
embrace
and
hug
with
amplest
entertainment
my
free
drift
halts
not
particularly
but
moves
itself
in
a
wide
sea
of
wax
no
levelld
malice
infects
one
comma
in
the
course
i
hold
but
flies
an
eagle
flight
bold
and
forth
on
leaving
no
tract
behind
how
shall
i
understand
you
i
will
unbolt
to
you
you
see
how
all
conditions
how
all
minds
as
well
of
glib
and
slippery
creatures
as
of
grave
and
austere
quality
tender
down
their
services
to
lord
timon
his
large
fortune
upon
his
good
and
gracious
nature
hanging
subdues
and
properties
to
his
love
and
tendance
all
sorts
of
hearts
yea
from
the
glassfacd
flatterer
to
apemantus
that
few
things
loves
better
than
to
abhor
himself
even
he
drops
down
the
knee
before
him
and
returns
in
peace
most
rich
in
timons
nod
i
saw
them
speak
together
sir
i
have
upon
a
high
and
pleasant
hill
feignd
fortune
to
be
thrond
the
base
o
the
mount

rankd
with
all
deserts
all
kind
of
natures
that

on
the

grace
to
present
slaves
and
servants
translates
his
rivals
tis
conceivd
to
scope
this
throne
this
fortune

methinks
with
one
man
beckond
from
the
rest
below
bowing
his
head
against
the
steepy
mount
to
climb
his
happiness
would
be
well
expressd
in
our
condition
nay
sir
but
hear
me
on
all
those
which
were
his
fellows
but
of
late
some
better
than
his
value
on
the
moment
follow
his
strides
his
lobbies
fill
with
tendance
rain
sacrificial
whisperings
in
his
ear
make
sacred
even
his

through
him
drink

of
these
when
fortune
in
her
shift

spurns
down

to
the
mountains

even
on
their
knees
and

let
him
slip
down
not

accompanying
his
declining
foot
tis
common
a
thousand
moral
paintings
i
can
show
that
shall
demonstrate
these
quick
blows
of
fortunes
more
pregnantly
than

to
imitate
them
faults
that

rich
are
fair
a
noble
spirit
nay
my
lords
ceremony
was
but
devisd
at
first
to
set
a
gloss
on
faint
deeds
hollow
welcomes
recanting
goodness
sorry
ere
tis
shown
but
where
there
is
true
friendship
there
needs
none
pray
sit
more
welcome
are
ye
to
my
fortunes
than
my
fortunes
to
me
my
lord
we
always
have
confessd
it
ho
ho
confessd
it
hangd
it
have
you
not
o
apemantus
you
are
welcome
no
you
shall
not
make
me
welcome
i
come
to
have
thee
thrust
me
out
of
doors
fie
thourt
a
churl
yeve
got
a
humour
there
does
not
become
a
man
tis
much
to
blame
they
say
my
lords
ira
furor
brevis
est
but
yond
man
is
ever
angry
go
let
him
have
a
table
by
himself
for
he
does
neither
affect
company
nor
is
he
fit
for
it
indeed
let
me
stay
at
thine
apperil
timon
i
come
to
observe
i
give
thee
warning
ont
i
take
no
heed
of
thee
thourt
an
athenian
therefore
welcome
i
myself
would
have
no
power
prithee
let
my
meat
make
thee
silent
i
scorn
thy
meat
twould
choke
me
for
i
should
neer
flatter
thee
o
you
gods
what
a
number
of
men
eat
timon
and
he
sees
them
not
it
grieves
me
to
see
so
many
dip
their
meat
in
one
mans
blood
and
all
the
madness
is
he
cheers
them
up
too
i
wonder
men
dare
trust
themselves
with
men
methinks
they
should
invite
them
without
knives
good
for
their
meat
and
safer
for
their
lives
theres
much
example
fort
the
fellow
that
sits
next
him
now
parts
bread
with
him
and
pledges
the
breath
of
him
in
a
divided
draught
is
the
readiest
man
to
kill
him
t
has
been
provd
if
i
were
a
huge
man

should
fear
to

at
meals
lest
they
should
spy
my
windpipes
dangerous
notes
great
men
should
drink
with
harness
on
their
throats
my
lord
in

and
let

his
tides

healths

make
thee
and
thy

a
sinner
honest
water

the

this
and
my
food

no

too
proud

give
thanks
to
the

immortal
gods
i
crave
no
pelf
i
pray
for
no
man
but
myself
grant
i
may
never
prove
so
fond
to
trust
man
on
his
oath
or
bond
or
a
harlot
for
her
weeping
or
a
dog
that
seems
asleeping
or
a
keeper
with
my
freedom
or
my
friends
if
i
should
need

amen
so
fall

dich
thy
good
heart
apemantus
captain
alcibiades
your
hearts
in
the
field
now
my
heart
is
ever
at
your
service
my
lord
you
had
rather
be
at
a
breakfast
of
enemies
than
a
dinner
of
friends
so
they
were
bleedingnew
my
lord
theres
no
meat
like
em
i
could
wish
my
best
friend
at
such
a
feast
would
all
those
flatterers
were
thine
enemies
then
that
then
thou
mightst
kill
em
and
bid
me
to
em
might
we
but
have
that
happiness
my
lord
that
you
would
once
use
our
hearts
whereby
we
might
express
some
part
of
our
zeals
we
should
think
ourselves
for
ever
perfect
o
no
doubt
my
good
friends
but
the
gods
themselves
have
provided
that
i
shall
have
much
help
from
you
how
had
you
been
my
friends
else
why
have
you
that
charitable
title
from
thousands
did
not
you
chiefly
belong
to
my
heart
i
have
told
more
of
you
to
myself
than
you
can
with
modesty
speak
in
your
own
behalf
and
thus
far
i
confirm
you
o
you
gods
think
i
what
need
we
have
any
friends
if
we
should
neer
have
need
of
em
they
were
the
most
needless
creatures
living
should
we
neer
have
use
for
em
and
would
most
resemble
sweet
instruments
hung
up
in
cases
that
keep
their
sounds
to
themselves
why
i
have
often
wished
myself
poorer
that
i
might
come
nearer
to
you
we
are
born
to
do
benefits
and
what
better
or
properer
can
we
call
our
own
than
the
riches
of
our
friends
o
what
a
precious
comfort
tis
to
have
so
many
like
brothers
commanding
one
anothers
fortunes
o
joy
een
made
away
ere
it
can
be
born
mine
eyes
cannot
hold
out
water
methinks
to
forget
their
faults
i
drink
to
you
thou
weepest
to
make
them
drink
timon
joy
had
the
like
conception
in
our
eyes
and
at
that
instant
like
a
babe
sprung
up
ho
ho
i
laugh
to
think
that
babe
a
bastard
i
promise
you
my
lord
you
movd
me
much
much
what
means
that
trump
how
now
please
you

lord

desirous

the
glory
of
this
life
as
this
pomp

to
a
little
oil
and
root
we
make
ourselves
fools
to
disport
ourselves
and
spend
our
flatteries
to
drink
those
men
upon
whose
age
we
void
it
up
again
with
poisonous
spite
and
envy
who
lives

not
depraved
or

not
one
spurn
to
their
graves
of

no
power
to

lock
thy

from
thee
o
that

follow
lover
elder
brother
and
woman
sometime
the
philosopher
pray
you
walk
near
ill
speak
with
you
anon
you
make
me
marvel
wherefore
ere
this
time
had
you
not
fully
laid
my
state
before
me
that
i
might
so
have
rated
my
expense
as
i
had
leave
of
means
you
would
not
hear
me
at
many
leisures
i
proposd
go
to
perchance
some
single
vantages
you
took
when
my
indisposition
put
you
back
and
that
unaptness
made
your
minister
thus
to
excuse
yourself
o
my
good
lord
at
many
times
i
brought
in
my
accounts
laid
them
before
you
you
would
throw
them
off
and
say
you
found
them
in
mine
honesty
when
for
some
trifling
present
you
have
bid
me
return
so
much
i
have
shook
my
head
and
wept
yea
gainst
the
authority
of
manners
prayd
you
to
hold
your
hand
more
close
i
did
endure
not
seldom
nor
no
slight
checks
when
i
have
prompted
you
in
the
ebb
of
your
estate
and
your
great
flow
of
debts
my
loved
lord
though
you
hear
now
too
late
yet
nows
a
time
the
greatest
of
your
having
lacks
a
half
to
pay
your
present
debts
let
all
my
land
be
sold

all
engagd
some
forfeited
and
gone
and
what
remains
will
hardly
stop
the
mouth
of
present
dues
the
future
comes
apace

shall
defend
the
interim
and
at
length
how
goes
our
reckoning

laced
mon

me
true
if
you
suspect
my
husbandry
or
falsehood

me
before
the
exactest
auditors
and
set
me
on
the
proof
so
the
gods
bless
me
when
all
our
offices
have
been
oppressd
with
riotous
feeders
when
our
vaults
have
wept
with
drunken
spilth
of
wine
when
every
room
hath
blazd
with
lights
and
brayd
with
minstrelsy
i
have
retird
me
to
a
wasteful
cock
and

bounty
of
this

how
many
prodigal
bits

to
them
to

such
a
faint
and
milky
heart
it
turns
in
less
than
two
nights
o
you
gods
i
feel
my
masters
passion
this
slave
unto
his
honour
has
my
lords
meat
in
him
why
should
it
thrive
and
turn
to
nutriment
when
he
is
turnd
to
poison
o
may
diseases
only
work
upon
t
and
when
hes
sick
to
death
let
not
that
part
of
nature
which
my
lord
paid
for
be
of
any
power
to
expel
sickness
but
prolong
his
hour
who
the
lord
timon
he
is
my
very
good
friend
and
an
honourable
gentleman
we
know
him
for
no
less
though
we
are
but
strangers
to
him
but
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
my
lord
and
which
i
hear
from
common
rumours
now
lord
timons
happy
hours
are
done
and
past
and
his
estate
shrinks
from
him
fie
no
do
not
believe
it
he
cannot
want
for
money
but
believe
you
this
my
lord
that
not
long
ago
one
of
his
men
was
with
the
lord
lucullus
to
borrow
so
many
talents
nay
urged
extremely
for
t
and
showed
what
necessity
belonged
to
t
and
yet
was
denied
how
i
tell
you
denied
my
lord
what
a
strange
case
was
that
now
before
the
gods
i
am
ashamed
on
t
denied
that
honourable
man
there
was
very
little
honour
showed
in
t
for
my
own
part
i
must
needs
confess
i
have
received
some
small
kindnesses
from
him
as
money
plate
jewels
and
such
like
trifles
nothing
comparing
to
his
yet
had
he
mistook
him
and
sent
to
me
i
should
neer
have
denied
his
occasion
so
many
talents
see
by
good
hap
yonders
my
lord
i
have
sweat
to
see
his
honour
my
honoured
lord
servilius
you
are
kindly
met
sir
fare
thee
well
commend
me
to
thy
honourable
virtuous
lord
my
very
exquisite
friend
may
it
please
your
honour
my
lord
hath
sent
ha
what
has
he
sent
i
am
so
much
endeared
to
that
lord
hes
ever
sending
how
shall
i
thank
him
thinkest
thou
and
what
has
he
sent
now
he
has
only
sent
his
present
occasion
now
my
lord
requesting
your
lordship
to
supply
his
instant
use
with
so
many
talents
i
know
his
lordship
is
but
merry
with
me
he
cannot
want
fiftyfive
hundred
talents
but
in
the
mean
time
he
wants
less
my
lord
if
his
occasion
were
not
virtuous
i
should
not
urge
it
half
so
faithfully
dost
thou
speak
seriously
servilius
upon
my
soul
tis
true
sir
what
a
wicked
beast
was
i
to
disfurnish
myself
against
such
a
good
time
when
i
might
ha
shown
myself
honourable
how
unluckily
it
happened
that
i
should
purchase
the
day
before
for
a
little
part
and
undo
a
great
deal
of
honour
servilius
now
before
the
gods
i
am
not
able
to
do
the
more
beast
i
say
i
was
sending
to
use
lord
timon
myself
these
gentlemen
can
witness
but
i
would
not
for
the
wealth
of
athens
i
had
done
it
now
commend
me
bountifully
to
his
good
lordship
and
i
hope
his
honour
will
conceive
the
fairest
of
me
because
i
have
no
power
to
be
kind
and
tell
him
this
from
me
i
count
it
one
of
my
greatest
afflictions
say
that
i
cannot
pleasure
such
an
honourable
gentleman
good
servilius
will
you
befriend
me
so
far
as
to
use
mine
own
words
to
him
yes
sir
i
shall
ill
look
you
out
a
good
turn
servilius
true
as
you
said
timon
is
shrunk
indeed
and
he
thats
once
denied
will
hardly
speed
do
you
observe
this
hostilius
ay
too
well
why
this
is
the
worlds
soul
and
just
of
the
same
piece
is
every
flatterers
spirit
who
can
call
him
his
friend
that
dips
in
the
same
dish
for
in
my
knowing
timon
has
been
this
lords
father
and
kept
his
credit
with
his
purse
supported
his
estate
nay
timons
money
has
paid
his
men
their
wages
he
neer
drinks
but
timons
silver
treads
upon
his
lip
and
yet
o
see
the
monstrousness
of
man
when
he
looks
out
in
an
ungrateful
shape
he
does
deny
him
in
respect
of
his
what
charitable
men
afford
to
beggars
religion
groans
at
it
for
mine
own
part
i
never
tasted
timon
in
my
life
nor
came
any
of
his
bounties
over
me
to
mark
me
for
his
friend
yet
i
protest
for
his
right
noble
mind
illustrious
virtue
and
honourable
carriage
had
his
necessity
made
use
of
me
i
would
have
put
my
wealth
into
donation
and
the
best
half
should
have
returnd
to
him
so
much
i
love
his
heart
but
i
perceive
men
must
learn
now
with
pity
to
dispense
for
policy
sits
above
conscience
must
he
needs
trouble
me
in
t
hum
bove
all
others
he
might
have
tried
lord
lucius
or
lucullus
and
now
ventidius
is
wealthy
too
whom
he
redeemd
from
prison
all
these
owe
their
estates
unto
him
my
lord
they
have
all
been
touchd
and
found
base
metal
for
they
have
all
denied
him
how
have
they
denied
him
have
ventidius
and
lucullus
denied
him
and
does
he
send
to
me
three
hum
it
shows
but
little
love
or
judgment
in
him
must
i
be
his
last
refuge
his
friends
like
physicians
thrice
give
him
over
must
i
take
the
cure
upon
me
he
has
much
disgracd
me
in
t
im
angry
at
him
that
might
have
known
my
place
i
see
no
sense
for
t
but
his
occasions
might
have
wood
me
first
for
in
my
conscience
i
was
the
first
man
that
eer
received
gift
from
him
and
does
he
think
so
backwardly
of
me
now
that
ill
requite
it
last
no
so
it
may
prove
an
argument
of
laughter
to
the
rest
and
i
mongst
lords
be
thought
a
fool
i
had
rather
than
the
worth
of
thrice
the
sum
he
had
sent
to
me
first
but
for
my
minds
sake
id
such
a
courage
to
do
him
good
but
now
return
and
with
their
faint
reply
this
answer
join
who
bates
mine
honour
shall
not
know
my
coin
excellent
your
lordships
a
goodly
villain
the
devil
knew
not
what
he
did
when
he
made
man
politic
he
crossed
himself
by
t
and
i
cannot
think
but
in
the
end
the
villanies
of
man
will
set
him
clear
how
fairly
this
lord
strives
to
appear
foul
takes
virtuous
copies
to
be
wicked
like
those
that
under
hot
ardent
zeal
would
set
whole
realms
on
fire
of
such
a
nature
is
his
politic
love
this
was
my
lords
best
hope
now
all
are
fled
save
only
the
gods
now
his
friends
are
dead
doors
that
were
neer
acquainted
with
their
wards
many
a
bounteous
year
must
be
employd
now
to
guard
sure
their
master
and
this
is
all
a
liberal
course
allows
who
cannot
keep
his
wealth
must
keep
his
house
well
met
good
morrow
titus
and
hortensius
the
like
to
you
kind
varro
lucius
what
do
we
meet
together
ay
and
i
think
one
business
does
command
us
all
for
mine
is
money
so
is
theirs
and
ours
and
sir
philotus
too
good
day
at
once
welcome
good
brother
what
do
you
think
the
hour
labouring
for
nine
so
much
is
not
my
lord
seen
yet
not
yet
i
wonder
on
t
he
was
wont
to
shine
at
seven
ay
but
the
days
are
waxed
shorter
with
him
you
must
consider
that
a
prodigal
course
is
like
the
suns
but
not
like
his
recoverable
i
fear
tis
deepest
winter
in
lord
timons
purse
that
is
one
may
reach
deep
enough
and
yet
find
little
i
am
of
your
fear
for
that
ill
show
you
how
to
observe
a
strange
event
your
lord
sends
now
for
money
most
true
he
does
and
he
wears
jewels
now
of
timons
gift
for
which
i
wait
for
money
it
is
against
my
heart
mark
how
strange
it
shows
timon
in
this
should
pay
more
than
he
owes
and
een
as
if
your
lord
should
wear
rich
jewels

chamber
many
do
keep
their
chambers
are
not
sick
and
if
it
be
so
far
beyond
his
health
methinks
he
should
the
sooner
pay
his
debts
and
make
a
clear
way

ill

my
lord
you
have
my
voice
to
it
the
faults
bloody
tis
necessary
he
should
die
nothing
emboldens
sin
so
much
as
mercy
most
true
the
law
shall
bruise
him
honour
health
and
compassion
to
the
senate
now
captain
i
am
a
humble
suitor
to
your
virtues
for
pity
is
the
virtue
of
the
law
and
none
but
tyrants
use
it
cruelly
it
pleases
time
and
fortune
to
lie
heavy
upon
a
friend
of
mine
who
in
hot
blood
hath
steppd
into
the
law
which
is
past
depth
to
those
that
without
heed
to
plunge
into
t
he
is
a
man
setting
his
fate
aside
of
comely
virtues
nor
did
he
soil
the
fact
with
cowardice
an
honour
in
him
which
buys
out
his
fault
but
with
a
noble
fury
and
fair
spirit
seeing
his
reputation
touchd
to
death
he
did
oppose
his
foe
and
with
such
sober
and
unnoted
passion
he
did
behave
his
anger
ere
twas
spent
as
if
he
had
but
provd
an
argument
you
undergo
too
strict
a
paradox
striving
to
make
an
ugly
deed
look
fair
your
words
have
took
such
pains
as
if
they
labourd
to
bring
manslaughter
into
form
and
set
quarrelling
upon
the
head
of
valour
which
indeed
is
valour
misbegot
and
came
into
the
world
when
sects
and
factions
were
newly
born
hes
truly
valiant
that
can
wisely
suffer
the
worst
that
man
can
breathe
and
make
his
wrongs
his
outsides
to
wear
them
like
his
raiment
carelessly
and
neer
prefer
his
injuries
to
his
heart
to
bring
it
into
danger
if
wrongs
be
evils
and
enforce
us
kill
what
folly
tis
to
hazard
life
for
ill
my
lord
you
cannot
make
gross
sins
look
clear
to
revenge
is
no
valour
but
to
bear
my
lords
then
under
favour
pardon
me
if
i
speak
like
a
captain
why
do
fond
men
expose
themselves
to
battle
and
not
endure
all
threats
sleep
upont
and
let
the
foes
quietly
cut
their
throats
without
repugnancy
if
there
be
such
valour
in
the
bearing
what
make
we
abroad
why
then
women
are
more
valiant
that
stay
at
home
if
bearing
carry
it
and
the
ass
more
captain
than
the
lion
the
felon
loaden
with
irons
wiser
than
the
judge
if
wisdom
be
in
suffering
o
my
lords
as
you
are
great
be
pitifully
good
who
cannot
condemn
rashness
in
cold
blood
to
kill
i
grant
is
sins
extremest
gust
but
in
defence
by
mercy
tis
most
just
to
be
in
anger
is
impiety
but
who
is
man
that
is
not
angry
weigh
but
the
crime
with
this
you
breathe
in
vain
in
vain
his
service
done
at
laced
mon
and
byzantium
were
a
sufficient
briber
for
his
life
whats
that
i
say
my
lords
he
has
done
fair
service
and
slain
in
fight
many
of
your
enemies
how
full
of
valour
did
he
bear
himself
in
the
last
conflict
and
made
plenteous
wounds
he
has
made
too
much
plenty
with
em
hes
a
sworn
rioter
he
has
a
sin
that
often
drowns
him
and
takes
his
valour
prisoner
if
there
were
no
foes
that
were
enough
to
overcome
him
in
that
beastly
fury
he
has
been
known
to
commit
outrages
and
cherish
factions
tis
inferrd
to
us
his
days
are
foul
and
his
drink
dangerous
he
dies
hard
fate
he
might
have
died
in
war
my
lords
if
not
for
any
parts
in
him
though
his
right
arm
might
purchase
his
own
time
and
be
in
debt
to
none
yet
more
to
move
you
take
my
deserts
to
his
and
join
em
both
and
for
i
know
your
reverend
ages
love
security
ill
pawn
my
victories
all
my
honour
to
you
upon
his
good
returns
if
by
this
crime
he
owes
the
law
his
life
why
let
the
war
receivet
in
valiant
gore
for
law
is
strict
and
war
is
nothing
more
we
are
for
law
he
dies
urge
it
no
more
on
height
of
our
displeasure
friend
or
brother
he
forfeits
his
own
blood
that
spills
another
must
it
be
so
it
must
not
be
my
lords
i
do
beseech
you
know
me
how
call
me
to
your
remembrances
what
i
cannot
think
but
your
age
has
forgot
me
it
could
not
else
be
i
should
prove
so
base
to
sue
and
be
denied
such
common
grace
my
wounds
ache
at
you
do
you
dare
our
anger
tis
in
few
words
but
spacious
in
effect
we
banish
thee
for
ever
banish
me
banish
your
dotage
banish
usury
that
makes
the
senate
ugly
if
after
two
days
shine
athens
contain
thee
attend
our
weightier
judgment
and
not
to
swell
our
spirit
he
shall
be
executed
presently
now
the
gods
keep
you
old
enough
that
you
may
live
only
in
bone
that
none
may
look
on
you
i
am
worse
than
mad
i
have
kept
back
their
foes
while
they
have
told
their
money
and
let
out
their
coin
upon
large
interest
i
myself
rich
only
in
large
hurts
all
those
for
this
is
this
the
balsam
that
the
usuring
senate
pours
into
captains
wounds
banishment
it
comes
not
ill
i
hate
not
to
be
banishd
it
is
a
cause
worthy
my
spleen
and
fury
that
i
may
strike
at
athens
ill
cheer
up
my
discontented
troops
and
lay
for
hearts
tis
honour
with
most
lands
to
be
at
odds
soldiers
should
brook
as
little
wrongs
as
gods
the
good
time
of
day
to
you
sir
i
also
wish
it
you
i
think
this
honourable
lord
did
but
try
us
this
other
day
upon
that
were
my
thoughts
tiring
when
we
encountered
i
hope
it
is
not
so
low
with
him
as
he
made
it
seem
in
the
trial
of
his
several
friends
it
should
not
be
by
the
persuasion
of
his
new
feasting
i
should
think
so
he
hath
sent
me
an
earnest
inviting
which
many
my
near
occasions
did
urge
me
to
put
off
but
he
hath
conjured
me
beyond
them
and
i
must
needs
appear
in
like
manner
was
i
in
debt
to
my
importunate
business
but
he
would
not
hear
my
excuse
i
am
sorry
when
he
sent
to
borrow
of
me
that
my
provision
was
out
i
am
sick
of
that
grief
too
as
i
understand
how
all
things
go
every
man
heres
so
what
would
he
have
borrowed
you
a
thousand
pieces
a
thousand
pieces
what
of
you
he
sent
to
me
sir
here
he
comes
with
all
my
heart
gentlemen
both
and
how
fare
you
ever
at
the
best
hearing

of
your
lordship

willing
than
we
your
lordship
nor
more
willingly

such
summerbirds

our
dinner
will
not
recompense
this
long
stay

your
ears
with
the
music
awhile
if
they
will
fare
so
harshly
o
the
trumpets
sound
we
shall
to
t
presently
i
hope
it
remains
not
unkindly
with
your
lordship
that
i
returned
you
an
empty
messenger
o
sir
let
it
not
trouble
you
my
noble
lord
ah

good
friend

most
honourable
lord

am
een
sick
of
shame
that
when
your
lordship

other
day

was
so
unfortunate
a
beggar
think
not
on

not
cumber
your
better
remembrance

your

reserve
still
to
give
lest
your
deities
be
despised
lend
to
each
man
enough
that
one
need
not
lend
to
another
for
were
your
godheads
to
borrow
of
men
men
would
forsake
the
gods
make
the
meat
be
beloved
more
than
the
man
that
gives
it
let
no

of

do
turn
our
backs
from
our
companion
thrown
into
his
grave
so
his
familiars
to
his
buried
fortunes
slink
all
away
leave
their
false
vows
with
him
like
empty
purses
pickd
and
his
poor
self
a
dedicated
beggar
to
the
air
with
his
disease
of
allshunnd
poverty
walks
like
contempt
alone
more
of

obedient
and
knew
my
mind
where
wouldst
thou
send
it
to
sauce
thy
dishes
the
middle
of
humanity
thou
never
knewest
but
the
extremity
of
both
ends
when
thou
wast
in
thy
gilt
and
thy
perfume
they
mocked
thee
for
too
much
curiosity
in
thy
rags
thou
knowest
none
but
art
despised
for
the
contrary
theres
a
medlar
for
thee
eat
it
on
what
i
hate
i

not
dost
hate
a
medlar
ay
though
it
look
like
thee
an
thou
hadst
hated
meddlers
sooner
thou
shouldst
have
loved
thyself
better
now
what
man
didst
thou
ever
know
unthrift
that
was
beloved
after
his
means
who
without
those
means
thou
talkest
of
didst
thou
ever
know
beloved
myself
i
understand
thee
thou
hadst
some
means
to
keep
a
dog
what
things
in
the
world
canst
thou
nearest
compare
to
thy
flatterers
women
nearest
but
men
men
are
the
things
themselves
what
wouldst
thou
do
with
the
world
apemantus
if
it
lay
in
thy
power
give
it
the
beasts
to
be
rid
of
the
men
wouldst
thou
have
thyself
fall
in
the
confusion
of
men
and
remain
a
beast
with
the
beasts
ay
timon
a
beastly
ambition
which
the
gods
grant
thee
to
attain
to
if
thou
wert
the
lion
the
fox
would
beguile
thee
if
thou
wert
the
lamb
the
fox
would
eat
thee
if
thou
wert
the
fox
the
lion
would
suspect
thee
when
peradventure
thou
wert
accused
by
the
ass
if
thou
wert
the
ass
thy
dulness
would
torment
thee
and
still
thou
livedst
but
as
a
breakfast
to
the
wolf
if
thou
wert
the
wolf
thy
greediness
would
afflict
thee
and
oft
thou
shouldst
hazard
thy
life
for
thy
dinner
wert
thou
the
unicorn
pride
and
wrath
would
confound
thee
and
make
thine
own
self
the
conquest
of
thy
fury
wert
thou
a
bear
thou
wouldst
be
killed
by
the
horse
wert
thou
a

thou
wouldst
be
seized
by
the

wert
thou
a

thou
wert
german
to

and
the

of
thy

all
thy

were
remotion

absence
what
beast
couldst
thou
be
that
were
not
subject
to
a
beast
and
what
a

art
thou
already
that
seest
not
thy
loss
in
transformation
if
thou
couldst
please
me
with
speaking
to

thou
mightst
have
hit
upon

he
has
almost
charmed
me
from

profession
by
persuading

to
it
tis
in
the
malice
of
mankind
that
he
thus
advises
us
not
to
have
us
thrive
in
our
mystery
ill
believe
him
as
an

and
give
over

let

first
see
peace
in
athens
there
is
no
time
so
miserable
but
a
man
may
be
true
o
you
gods
is
yond
despised
and
ruinous
man
my
lord
full
of
decay
and
failing
o
monument
and
wonder
of
good
deeds
evilly
bestowd
what
an
alteration
of
honour
has
desperate
want
made
what
viler
thing
upon
the
earth
than
friends
who
can
bring
noblest
minds
to
basest
ends
how
rarely
does
it
meet
with
this
times
guise
when
man
was
wishd
to
love
his
enemies
grant
i
may
ever
love
and
rather
woo
those
that
would
mischief
me
than
those
that
do
he
hath
caught
me
in
his
eye
i
will
present
my
honest
grief
unto
him
and
as
my
lord
still
serve
him
with
my
life
my
dearest
master
away
what
art
thou
have
you
forgot
me
sir
why
dost
ask
that
i
have
forgot
all
men
then
if
thou
grantst
thourt
a
man
i
have
forgot
thee
an
honest
poor
servant
of
yours
then
i
know
thee
not
i
never
had
an
honest
man
about
me
ay
all
i
kept
were
knaves
to
serve
in
meat
to
villains
the
gods
are
witness
neer
did
poor
steward
wear
a
truer
grief
for
his
undone
lord
than
mine
eyes
for
you
what
dost
thou
weep
come
nearer
then
i
love
thee
because
thou
art
a
woman
and
disclaimst
flinty
mankind
whose
eyes
do
never
give
but
thorough
lust
and
laughter
pitys
sleeping
strange
times
that
weep
with
laughing
not
with
weeping
i
beg
of
you
to
know
me
good
my
lord
to
accept
my
grief
and
whilst
this
poor
wealth
lasts
to
entertain
me
as
your
steward
still
had
i
a
steward
so
true
so
just
and
now
so
comfortable
it
almost
turns
my
dangerous
nature
mild
let
me
behold
thy
face
surely
this
man
was
born
of
woman
forgive
my
general
and
exceptless
rashness
you
perpetual
sober
gods
i
do
proclaim
one
honest
man
mistake
me
not
but
one
no
more
i
pray
and
hes
a
steward
how
fain
would
i
have
hated
all
mankind
and
thou
redeemst
thyself
but
all
save
thee
i
fell
with
curses
methinks
thou
art
more
honest
now
than
wise
for
by
oppressing
and
betraying
me
thou
mightst
have
sooner
got
another
service
for
many
so
arrive
at
second
masters
upon
their
first
lords
neck
but
tell
me
true
for
i
must
ever
doubt
though
neer
so
sure
is
not
thy
kindness
subtle
covetous
if
not
a
usuring
kindness
and
as
rich
men
deal
gifts
expecting
in
return
twenty
for
one
no
my
most
worthy
master
in
whose
breast
doubt
and
suspect
alas
are
placd
too
late
you
should
have
feard
false
times
when
you
did
feast
suspect
still
comes
when
an
estate
is
least
that
which
i
show
heaven
knows
is
merely
love
duty
and
zeal
to
your
unmatched
mind
care
of
your
food
and
living
and
believe
it
my
most
honourd
lord
for
any
benefit
that
points
to
me
either
in
hope
or
present
id
exchange
for
this
one
wish
that
you
had
power
and
wealth
to
requite
me
by
making
rich
yourself
look
thee
tis
so
thou
singly
honest
man
here
take
the
gods
out
of
my
misery
have
sent
thee
treasure
go
live
rich
and
happy
but
thus
conditiond
thou
shalt
build
from
men
hate
all
curse
all
show
charity
to
none
but
let
the
famishd
flesh
slide
from
the
bone
ere
thou
relieve
the
beggar
give
to
dogs
what
thou
denyst
to
men
let
prisons
swallow
em
debts
wither
em
to
nothing
be
men
like
blasted
woods
and
may
diseases
lick
up
their
false
bloods
and
so
farewell
and
thrive
o
let
me
stay
and
comfort
you
my
master
if
thou
hatest
curses
stay
not
fly
whilst
thourt
blessd
and
free
neer
see
thou
man
and
let
me
neer
see
thee
as
i
took
note
of
the
place
it
cannot
be
far
where
he
abides
whats
to
be
thought
of
him
does
the
rumour
hold
for
true
that
he
is
so
full
of
gold
certain
alcibiades
reports
it
phrynia
and
timandra
had
gold
of
him
he
likewise
enriched
poor
straggling
soldiers
with
great
quantity
tis
said
he
gave
unto
his
steward
a
mighty
sum
then
this
breaking
of
his
has
been
but
a
try
for
his
friends
nothing
else
you
shall
see
him
a
palm
in
athens
again
and
flourish
with
the
highest
therefore
tis
not
amiss
we
tender
our
loves
to
him
in
this
supposed
distress
of
his
it
will
show
honestly
in
us
and
is
very
likely
to
load
our
purposes
with
what
they
travel
for
if
it
be
a
just
and
true
report
that
goes
of
his
having
what
have
you
now
to
present
unto
him
nothing
at
this
time
but
my
visitation
only
i
will
promise
him
an
excellent
piece
i
must
serve
him
so
too
tell
him
of
an
intent
thats
coming
towards
him
good
as
the
best
promising
is
the
very
air
o
the
time
it
opens
the
eyes
of
expectation
performance
is
ever
the
duller
for
his
act
and
but
in
the
plainer
and
simpler
kind
of
people
the
deed
of
saying
is
quite
out
of
use
to
promise
is
most
courtly
and
fashionable
performance
is
a
kind
of
will
or
testament
which
argues
a
great
sickness
in
his
judgment
that
makes
it
excellent
workman
thou
canst
not
paint
a
man
so
bad
as
is
thyself
i
am
thinking
what
i
shall
say
i
have
provided
for
him
it
must
be
a
personating
of
himself
a
satire
against
the
softness
of
prosperity
with
a
discovery
of
the
infinite
flatteries
that
follow
youth
and
opulency
must
thou
needs
stand
for
a
villain
in
thine
own
work
wilt
thou
whip
thine
own
faults
in
other
men
do
so
i
have
gold
for
thee
nay
lets
seek
him
then
do
we
sin
against
our
own
estate
when
we
may
profit
meet
and
come
too
late
true
when
the
day
serves
before
blackcornerd
night
find
what
thou
wantst
by
free
and
offerd
light
come
ill
meet
you
at
the
turn
what
a
gods
gold
that
he
is
worshippd
in
a
baser
temple
than
where
swine
feed
tis
thou
that
riggst
the
bark
and
ploughst
the
foam
settlest
admired
reverence
in
a
slave
to
thee
be
worship
and
thy
saints
for
aye
be
crownd
with
plagues
that
thee
alone
obey

starlike
nobleness

life
and
influence

rapt

cover
the
monstrous
bulk
of

ingratitude

any
size
of
words

go
naked

the

consent
of
love
entreat
thee
back
to
athens
who
have
thought
on
special
dignities
which
vacant
lie
for
thy
best
use
and
wearing
they
confess
toward
thee
forgetfulness
to
general
gross
which
now
the
public
body
which
doth
seldom
play
the
recanter
feeling
in
itself
a
lack
of
timons
aid
hath
sense
withal
of
its
own
fail
restraining
aid
to
timon
and
send
forth
us
to
make
their
sorrowd
render
together
with
a
recompense
more
fruitful
than
their
offence
can
weigh
down
by
the
dram
ay
even
such
heaps
and
sums
of
love
and
wealth
as
shall
to
thee
block
out
what
wrongs
were
theirs
and
write
in
thee
the
figures
of
their
love
ever
to
read

me
to
the
very
brink
of

lend
me
a
fools
heart
and
a
womans

shalt
be

authority
so
soon
we
shall
drive
back
of
alcibiades
the
approaches
wild
who
like
a
boar
too
savage
doth
root
up
his
countrys
peace
and
shakes
his
threatning
sword
against
the
walls
of
athens
therefore
timon
well
sir
i
will
therefore
i
will
sir
thus
if
alcibiades
kill
my
countrymen
let
alcibiades
know
this
of
timon
that
timon
cares
not
but
if
he
sack
fair
athens
and
take
our
goodly
aged
men
by
the
beards
giving
our
holy
virgins
to
the
stain
of
contumelious
beastly
madbraind
war
then
let
him
know
and
tell
him
timon
speaks
it
in
pity
of
our
aged
and
our
youth
i
cannot
choose
but
tell
him
that
i
care
not
and
let
him
taket
at
worst
for
their
knives
care
not
while
you
have
throats
to
answer
for
myself
theres
not
a
whittle
in
the
unruly
camp
but
i
do
prize
it
at
my
love
before
the
reverendst
throat
in
athens
so
i
leave
you
to
the
protection
of
the
prosperous
gods
as
thieves
to
keepers
stay
not
alls
in
vain
why
i
was
writing
of
my
epitaph
it
will
be
seen
tomorrow
my
long
sickness
of
health
and
living
now
begins
to
mend
and
nothing
brings
me
all
things
go
live
still
be
alcibiades
your
plague
you
his
and
last
so
long
enough
we
speak
in
vain
but
yet
i
love
my
country
and
am
not
one
that
rejoices
in
the
common
wrack
as
common
bruit
doth
put
it
thats
well
spoke
commend
me
to
my
loving
countrymen
these
words
become
your
lips
as
they
pass
through
them
and
enter
in
our
ears
like
great
triumphers
in
their
applauding
gates
commend
me
to
them
and
tell
them
that
to
ease
them
of
their
griefs
their
fears
of
hostile
strokes
their
aches
losses
their
pangs
of
love
with
other
incident
throes
that
natures
fragile
vessel
doth
sustain
in
lifes
uncertain
voyage
i
will
some
kindness
do
them
ill
teach
them
to
prevent
wild
alcibiades
wrath
i
like
this
well
he
will
return
again
i
have
a
tree
which
grows
here
in
my
close
that
mine
own
use
invites
me
to
cut
down
and
shortly
must
i
fell
it
tell
my
friends
tell
athens
in
the
sequence
of
degree
from
high
to
low
throughout
that
whoso
please
to
stop
affliction
let
him
take
his
haste
come
hither
ere
my
tree
hath
felt
the
axe
and
hang
himself
i
pray
you
do
my
greeting
trouble
him
no
further
thus
you
still
shall
find
him
come
not
to
me
again
but
say
to
athans
timon
hath
made
his
everlasting
mansion
upon
the
beached
verge
of
the
salt
flood
who
once
a
day
with
his
embossed
froth
the
turbulent
surge
shall
cover
thither
come
and
let
my
gravestone
be
your
oracle
lips
let
sour
words
go
by
and
language
end
what
is
amiss
plague
and
infection
mend
graves
only
be
mens
works
and
death
their
gain
sun
hide
thy
beams
timon
hath
done
his
reign
his
discontents
are
unremovably
coupled
to
nature
our
hope
in
him
is
dead
let
us
return
and
strain
what
other
means
is
left
unto
us
in
our
dear
peril
it
requires
swift
foot
thou
hast
painfully
discoverd
are
his
files
as
full
as
thy
report
i
have
spoke
the
least
besides
his
expedition
promises
present
approach
we
stand
much
hazard
if
they
bring
not
timon
i
met
a
courier
one
mine
ancient
friend
whom
though
in
general
part
we
were
opposd
yet
our
old
love
made
a
particular
force
and
made
us
speak
like
friends
this
man
was
riding
from
alcibiades
to
timons
cave
with
letters
of
entreaty
which
imported
his
fellowship
i
the
cause
against
your
city
in
part
for
his
sake
movd
here
come
our
brothers
no
talk
of
timon
nothing
of
him
expect
the
enemies
drum
is
heard
and
fearful
scouring
doth
choke
the
air
with
dust
in
and
prepare
ours
is
the
fall
i
fear
our
foes
the
snare
by
all
description
this
should
be
the
place
whos
here
speak
ho
no
answer
what
is
this
timon
is
dead
who
hath
outstretchd
his
span
some
beast
reard
this
here
does
not
live
a
man
dead
sure
and
this
his
grave
whats
on
this
tomb
i
cannot
read
the
character
ill
take
with
wax
our
captain
hath
in
every
figure
skill
an
agd
interpreter
though
young
in
days
before
proud
athens
hes
set
down
by
this
whose
fall
the
mark
of
his
ambition
is
sound
to
this
coward
and
lascivious
town
our
terrible
approach
till
now
you
have
gone
on
and
filld
the
time
with
all
licentious
measure
making
your
wills
the
scope
of
justice
till
now
myself
and
such
as
slept
within
the
shadow
of
your
power
have
wanderd
with
our
traversd
arms
and
breathd
our
sufferance
vainly
now
the
time
is
flush
when
crouching
marrow
in
the
bearer
strong
cries
of
itself
no
more
now
breathless
wrong
shall
sit
and
pant
in
your
great
chairs
of
ease
and
pursy
insolence
shall
break
his
wind
with
fear
and
horrid
flight
noble
and
young
when
thy
first
griefs
were
but
a
mere
conceit
ere
thou
hadst
power
or
we
had
cause
of
fear
we
sent
to
thee
to
give
thy
rages
balm
to
wipe
out
our
ingratitude
with
loves
above
their
quantity
so
did
we
woo
transformed
timon
to
our
citys
love
by
humble
message
and
by
promisd
means
we
were
not
all
unkind
nor
all
deserve
the
common
stroke
of
war
these
walls
of
ours
were
not
erected
by
their
hands
from
whom
you
have
receivd
your
grief
nor
are
they
such
that
these
great
towers
trophies
and
schools
should
fall
for
private
faults
in
them
nor
are
they
living
who
were
the
motives
that
you
first
went
out
shame
that
they
wanted
cunning
in
excess
hath
broke
their
hearts
march
noble
lord
into
our
city
with
thy
banners
spread
by
decimation
and
a
tithed
death
if
thy
revenges
hunger
for
that
food
which
nature
loathes
take
thou
the
destind
tenth
and
by
the
hazard
of
the
spotted
die
let
die
the
spotted
all
have
not
offended
for
those
that
were
it
is
not
square
to
take
on
those
that
are
revenges
crimes
like
lands
are
not
inherited
then
dear
countryman
bring
in
thy
ranks
but
leave
without
thy
rage
spare
thyathenian
cradle
and
those
kin
which
in
the
bluster
of
thy
wrath
must
fall
with
those
that
have
offended
like
a
shepherd
approach
the
fold
and
cull
th

forth
but
kill
not
all
together
what
thou
wilt
thou
rather
shalt
enforce
it
with
thy
smile
thank

thy

and
they

that
thou

all
thy

noble
meaning
not

shall
pass
his

my

is
dead
entombd
upon
the
very
hem
o
the

and
on
his
gravestone
this
insculpture
which
with
wax
i
brought
away

our

so
desperate
grown
to

how
now
lords
so
near

palace
dare
you
draw
and
maintain
such
a
quarrel
openly
full
well
i
wot
the
ground
of
all
this
grudge
i
would
not
for
a
million
of
gold
the

were
known
to

be
so
dishonourd
in

for

put
up
not
i
till

and
withal
thrust
those
reproachful
speeches
down

that
he
hath

here
for
that
i

i
say
now
by
the

that
warlike
goths

this
petty
brabble

undo

all
why
lords
and
think
you
not
how
dangerous
it
is
to
jet
upon
a
princes
right
what
is
lavinia
then
become
so
loose
or
bassianus
so
degenerate
that
for
her
love
such
quarrels
may
be
broachd
without
controlment
justice
or
revenge
young
lords
beware
an
should
the
empress
know
this
discords
ground
the
music
would
not
please
i
care
not
i
knew
she
and
all
the
world
i
love
lavinia
more
than
all
the
world
youngling
learn
thou
to
make
some
meaner
choice
lavinia
is
thine
elder
brothers
hope
why
are
ye
mad
or
know
ye
not
in
rome
how
furious
and
impatient
they
be
and
cannot
brook
competitors
in
love
i
tell
you
lords
you
do
but
plot
your
deaths
by
this
device
aaron
a
thousand
deaths
would
i
propose
to
achieve
her
whom
i
love
to
achieve
her
how
why
makst
thou
it
so
strange
she
is
a
woman
therefore
may
be
wood
she
is
a
woman
therefore
may
be
won
she
is
lavinia
therefore
must
be
lovd
what
man
more
water
glideth
by
the
mill
than
wots
the
miller
of
and
easy
it
is
of
a
cut
loaf
to
steal
a
shive
we
know
though
bassianus
be
the
emperors
brother
better
than
he
have
worn
vulcans
badge
ay
and
as
good
as
saturninus
may
then
why
should
he
despair
that
knows
to
court
it
with
words
fair
looks
and
liberality
what
hast
thou
not
full
often
struck
a
doe
and
borne
her
cleanly
by
the
keepers
nose
why
then
it
seems
some
certain
snatch
or
so
would
serve
your
turns
ay
so
the
turn
were
servd
aaron
thou
hast
hit
it
would
you
had
hit
it
too
then
should
not
we
be
tird
with
this
ado
why
hark
ye
hark
ye
and
are
you
such
fools
to
square
for
this
would
it
offend
you
then
that
both
should
speed
faith
not
me
nor
me
so
i
were
one
for
shame
be
friends
and
join
for
that
you
jar
tis
policy
and
stratagem
must
do
that
you
affect
and
so
must
you
resolve
that
what
you
cannot
as
you
would
achieve
you
must
perforce
accomplish
as
you
may
take
this
of
me
lucrece
was
not
more
chaste
than
this
lavinia
bassianus
love
a
speedier
course
than
lingering
languishment
must
we
pursue
and
i
have
found
the
path
my
lords
a
solemn
hunting
is
in
hand
there
will
the
lovely
roman
ladies
troop
the
forest
walks
are
wide
and
spacious
and
many
unfrequented
plots

are
fitted
by
kind
for
rape
and
villany

this
dainty
doe
and

home
by
force

you
in

come
come
our

with
her
sacred
wit
to
villany
and
vengeance
consecrate
will
we
acquaint
with
all
that
we
intend
and
she
shall
file
our
engines
with
advice
that
will
not
suffer
you
to
square
yourselves
but
to
your
wishes
height
advance
you
both
the
emperors
court
is
like
the
house
of
fame
the
palace
full
of
tongues
of
eyes
and
ears
the
woods
are
ruthless
dreadful
deaf
and
dull
there
speak
and
strike
brave
boys
and
take
your
turns
there

make
a
bay
and
wake
the
emperor
and
his
lovely
bride
and
rouse
the
prince
and
ring
a
hunters
peal
that
all
the
court
may
echo
with
the
noise
sons
let
it
be
your
charge
as
it
is
ours
to
attend
the
emperors
person
carefully
i
have
been
troubled
in
my
sleep
this
night
but
dawning
day
new
comfort
hath
inspird
many
good
morrows
to
your
majesty
madam
to
you
as
many
and
as
good
i
promised
your
grace
a
hunters
peal
and
you
have
rung
it
lustily
my
lord
somewhat
too
early
for
newmarried
ladies
lavinia
how
say
you
i
say
no
i
have
been
broad
awake
two
hours
and
more
come

have

our
sport

now
shall
ye
see
our
roman
hunting
i
have
dogs
my
lord
will
rouse
the
proudest
panther
in
the
chase
and
climb
the
highest
promontory
top
and
i
have
horse
will
follow
where
the
game
makes
way
and
run
like
swallows
oer
the
plain
chiron
we
hunt
not
we
with
horse
nor
hound
but
hope
to
pluck
a
dainty
doe
to
ground
he
that
had
wit
would
think
that
i
had
none
to
bury
so
much
gold
under
a
tree
and
never
after
to
inherit
it
let
him
that
thinks
of
me
so
abjectly
know
that
this
gold
must
coin
a
stratagem
which
cunningly
effected
will
beget
a
very
excellent
piece
of
villany
and
so
repose
sweet
gold
for
their
unrest
that
have
their
alms
out
of
the
empress
chest
my
lovely
aaron
wherefore
lookst
thou
sad
when
every
thing
doth
make
a
gleeful
boast
the
birds
chant
melody
on
every
bush
the
snake
lies
rolled
in
the
cheerful
sun
the
green
leaves
quiver
with
the
cooling
wind
and
make
a
chequerd
shadow
on
the
ground
under
their
sweet
shade
aaron
let
us
sit
and
whilst
the
babbling
echo
mocks
the
hounds
replying
shrilly
to
the
welltund
horns
as
if
a
double
hunt
were
heard
at
once
let
us
sit
down
and
mark
their
yelping
noise
and
after
conflict
such
as
was
supposd
the
wandering
prince
and
dido
once
enjoyd
when
with
a
happy
storm
they
were
surprisd
and
curtaind
with
a
counselkeeping
cave
we
may
each
wreathed
in
the
others
arms
our
pastimes
done
possess
a
golden
slumber
whiles
hounds
and
horns
and
sweet
melodious
birds
be
unto
us
as
is
a
nurses
song
of

and
the

should
drive
upon
thy

limbs
unmannerly
intruder
as
thou
art
under
your
patience
gentle
empress
tis
thought
you
have
a
goodly
gift
in
horning
and
to
be
doubted
that
your
moor
and
you
are
singled
forth
to
try
experiments
jove
shield
your
husband
from
his
hounds
today
tis
pity
they
should
take
him
for
a
stag
believe
me
queen
your
swarth
cimmerian
doth
make
your
honour
of
his
bodys
hue
spotted
detested
and
abominable
why
are
you
sequesterd
from
all
your
train
dismounted
from
your
snowwhite
goodly
steed
and
wanderd
hither
to
an
obscure
plot
accompanied
but
with
a
barbarous
moor
if
foul
desire
had
not
conducted
you
and
being
intercepted
in
your
sport
great
reason
that
my
noble
lord
be
rated
for
sauciness
i
pray
you
let
us
hence
and
let
her
joy
her
ravencolourd
love
this
valley
fits
the
purpose
passing
well
the
king
my
brother
shall
have
note
of
this
ay
for
these
slips
have
made
him
noted
long
good
king
to
be
so
mightily
abusd
why
have
i
patience
to
endure
all
this
how
now
dear
sovereign
and
our
gracious
mother
why
doth
your
highness
look
so
pale
and
wan
have
i
not
reason
think
you
to
look
pale
these
two
have
ticd
me
hither
to
this
place
a
barren
detested
vale
you
see
it
is
the
trees
though
summer
yet
forlorn
and
lean
oercome
with
moss
and
baleful
mistletoe
here
never
shines
the
sun
here
nothing
breeds
unless
the
nightly
owl
or
fatal
raven
and
when
they
showd
me
this
abhorred
pit
they
told
me
here
at
dead
time
of
the
night
a
thousand
fiends
a
thousand
hissing
snakes
ten
thousand
swelling
toads
as
many
urchins
would
make
such
fearful
and
confused
cries
as
any
mortal
body
hearing
it
should
straight
fall
mad
or
else
die
suddenly
no
sooner
had
they
told
this
hellish
tale
but
straight
they
told
me
they
would
bind
me
here
unto
the
body
of
a
dismal
yew
and
leave
me
to
this
miserable
death
and
then
they
called
me
foul
adulteress
lascivious
goth
and
all
the
bitterest
terms
that
ever
ear
did
hear
to
such
effect
and
had
you
not
by
wondrous
fortune
come
this
vengeance
on
me
had
they
executed
revenge
it
as
you
love
your
mothers
life
or
be
ye
not
henceforth
calld
my
children
this
is
a
witness
that
i
am
thy
son
and
this
for
me
struck
home
to
show
my
strength
ay
come
semiramis
nay
barbarous
tamora
for
no
name
fits
thy
nature
but
thy
own
give
me
thy
poniard
you
shall
know
my
boys
your
mothers

with
rudegrowing
briers
upon
whose
leaves
are
drops
of
newshed
blood
as
fresh
as
mornings
dew
distilld
on
flowers
a
very
fatal
place

seems
to
me
speak
brother

thou
hurt
thee
with
the
fall

dismallst
object

likely
guess

his
brother

comfort
me
and
help
me
out
from
this
unhallowd
and
bloodstained
hole
i
am
surprised
with
an
uncouth
fear
a
chilling
sweat
oerruns
my
trembling
joints
my
heart
suspects
more
than
mine
eye
can
see
to
prove
thou
hast
a
truedivining
heart
aaron
and
thou
look
down
into
this
den
and

fearful
sight
of
blood
and
death
aaron
is
gone
and
my
compassionate
heart
will
not
permit
mine
eyes
once
to
behold

how
it
is
for

i
a
child
to

i
know
not
what
lord

embrewed
here
all
on
a
heap
like
to
a
slaughterd
lamb
in
this
detested
dark
blooddrinking
pit
if
it
be
dark
how
dost
thou
know
tis
he
upon
his
bloody
finger
he
doth
wear
a
precious
ring
that
lightens
all
the
hole
which
like
a
taper
in
some
monument
doth
shine
upon
the
dead
mans
earthy
cheeks
and
shows
the
ragged
entrails
of
the
pit
so
pale
did
shine
the
moon
on
pyramus
when
he
by
night
lay
bathd
in
maiden
blood
o
brother
help
me
with
thy
fainting
hand
if
fear
hath
made
thee
faint
as
me
it
hath

of
this
fell
devouring
receptacle
as
hateful
as
cocytus
misty
mouth
reach
me
thy
hand
that
i
may
help
thee
out
or
wanting
strength
to
do
thee
so
much
good
i
may
be
pluckd
into
the
swallowing
womb
of
this
deep
pit
poor
bassianus
grave
i
have
no
strength
to
pluck
thee
to
the
brink
nor
i
no
strength
to
climb
without
thy
help
thy
hand
once
more
i
will
not
loose
again
till
thou
art
here
aloft
or
i
below
thou
canst
not
come
to
me
i
come
to
thee
along
with
me
ill
see
what
hole
is
here
and
what
he
is
that
now
is
leapd
into
it
say
who
art
thou
that
lately
didst
descend
into
this
gaping
hollow
of
the
earth
the
unhappy
son
of
old
andronicus
brought
hither
in
a
most
unlucky
hour
to
find
thy
brother
bassianus
dead
my
brother
dead
i
know
thou
dost
but
jest
he
and
his
lady
both
are
at
the
lodge
upon
the
north
side
of
this
pleasant
chase
tis
not
an
hour
since
i
left
him
there
we
know
not
where
you
left
him
all
alive
but
out
alas
here
have
we
found
him
dead
where
is
my
lord
the
king
here
tamora
though
grievd
with
killing
grief
where
is
thy
brother
bassianus
now
to
the
bottom
dost
thou
search
my
wound
poor
bassianus
here
lies
murdered
then
all
too
late
i
bring
this
fatal
writ
the
complot
of
this
timeless
tragedy
and
wonder
greatly
that
mans
face
can
fold
in
pleasing
smiles
such
murderous
tyranny
and
if
we
miss
to
meet
him
handsomely
sweet
huntsman
bassianus
tis
we
mean
do
thou
so
much
as
dig
the
grave
for
him
thou
knowst
our
meaning
look
for
thy
reward
among
the
nettles
at
the
eldertree
which
overshades
the
mouth
of
that
same
pit
where
we
decreed
to
bury
bassianus
do
this
and
purchase
us
thy
lasting
friends
o
tamora
was
ever
heard
the
like
this
is
the
pit
and
this
the
eldertree
look
sirs
if
you
can
find
the
huntsman
out
that
should
have
murderd
bassianus
here
my
gracious
lord

is
the
bag
of
gold
two
of
thy
whelps

of
bloody
kind

here
bereft
my
brother
of
his
life
sirs
drag
them
from
the
pit
unto
the
prison
there
let
them
bide
until
we
have
devisd
some
neverheardof
torturing
pain
for
them
what
are
they
in
this
pit
o
wondrous
thing
how
easily
murder
is
discovered
high
emperor
upon
my
feeble
knee
i
beg
this
boon
with
tears
not
lightly
shed
that
this
fell
fault
of
my
accursed
sons
accursed
if
the
fault
be
provd
in
them
if
it
be
provd
you
see
it
is
apparent
who
found
this
letter
tamora
was
it
you
andronicus
himself
did
take
it
up
i
did
my
lord
yet
let
me
be
their
bail
for
by
my
fathers
reverend
tomb
i
vow
they
shall
be
ready
at
your
highness
will
to
answer
their
suspicion
with
their
lives
thou
shalt
not
bail
them
see
thou
follow
me
some
bring
the
murderd
body
some
the
murderers
let
them
not
speak
a
word
the
guilt
is
plain
for
by
my
soul
were
there
worse
end
than
death
that
end
upon
them
should
be
executed
andronicus
i
will
entreat
the
king
fear
not
thy
sons
they
shall
do
well
enough
come
lucius
come
stay
not
to
talk
with
them
so
now
go
tell
an
if
thy
tongue
can
speak
who
twas
that
cut
thy
tongue
and
ravishd
thee
write
down
thy
mind
bewray
thy
meaning
so
an
if
thy
stumps
will
let
thee
play
the
scribe
see
how
with
signs
and
tokens
she
can
scrowl
go
home
call
for
sweet
water
wash
thy
hands
she
hath
no
tongue
to
call
nor
hands
to
wash
and
so
lets
leave
her
to
her
silent
walks
an
twere
my
case
i
should
go
hang
myself
if
thou
hadst
hands
to
help
thee
knit
the
cord
whos
this
my
niece
that
flies
away
so
fast
cousin
a
word
where
is
your
husband
if
i
do
dream
would
all
my
wealth
would
wake
me
if
i
do
wake
some
planet
strike
me
down
that
i
may
slumber
in
eternal
sleep
speak
gentle
niece
what
stern
ungentle
hands
have
loppd
and
hewd
and
made
thy
body
bare
of
her
two
branches
those
sweet
ornaments
whose
circling
shadows
kings
have
sought
to
sleep
in
and
might
not
gain
so
great
a
happiness
as
have
thy
love
why
dost
not
speak
to
me
alas
a
crimson
river
of
warm
blood
like
to
a
bubbling
fountain
stirrd
with
wind
doth
rise
and
fall
between
thy
rosed
lips
coming
and
going
with
thy
honey
breath
but
sure
some
tereus
hath
deflowerd
thee
and
lest
thou
shouldst
detect
him
cut
thy
tongue
ah
now
thou
turnst
away
thy
face
for
shame
and
notwithstanding
all
this
loss
of
blood
as
from
a
conduit
with
three
issuing
spouts
yet
do
thy
cheeks
look
red
as
titans
face
blushing
to
be
encounterd
with
a
cloud
shall
i
speak
for
thee
shall
i
say
tis
so
o
that
i
knew
thy
heart
and
knew
the
beast
that
i
might
rail
at
him
to
ease
my
mind
sorrow
concealed
like
to
an
oven
stoppd
doth
burn
the
heart
to
cinders
where
it
is
fair
philomela
she
but
lost
her
tongue
and
in
a
tedious
sampler
sewd
her
mind
but
lovely
niece
that
mean
is
cut
from
thee
a
craftier
tereus
hast
thou
met
withal
and
he
hath
cut
those
pretty
fingers
off
that
could
have
better
sewd
than
philomel
o
had
the
monster
seen
those
lily
hands
tremble
like
aspenleaves
upon
a
lute
and
make
the
silken
strings
delight
to
kiss
them
he
would
not
then
have
touchd
them
for
his
life
or
had
he
heard
the
heavenly
harmony
which
that
sweet
tongue
hath
made
he
would
have
droppd
his
knife
and
fell
asleep
as
cerberus
at
the
thracian
poets
feet
come
let
us
go
and
make
thy
father
blind
for
such
a
sight
will
blind
a
fathers
eye
one
hours
storm
will
drown
the
fragrant
meads
what
will
whole
months
of
tears
thy
fathers
eyes
do
not
draw
back
for
we
will
mourn
with
thee
o
could
our
mourning
ease
thy
misery
hear
me
grave
fathers
noble
tribunes
stay
for
pity
of
mine
age
whose
youth
was
spent
in
dangerous
wars
whilst
you
securely
slept
for
all
my
blood
in
romes
great
quarrel
shed
for
all
the
frosty
nights
that
i
have
watchd
and
for
these
bitter
tears
which
now
you
see
filling
the
aged
wrinkles
in
my
cheeks
be
pitiful
to
my
condemned
sons
whose
souls
are
not
corrupted
as
tis
thought
for
two
and
twenty
sons
i
never
wept
because
they
died
in
honours
lofty
bed
for
these
these
tribunes
in
the
dust
i
write
my
hearts
deep
languor
and
my
souls
sad
tears
let
my
tears
stanch
the
earths
dry
appetite
my
sons
sweet
blood
will
make
it
shame
and
blush
o
earth
i
will
befriend
thee
more
with
rain
that
shall
distil
from
these
two
ancient
urns
than
youthful
april
shall
with
all
his
showers
in
summers
drought
ill
drop
upon
thee
still
in
winter
with
warm
tears
ill
melt
the
snow
and
keep
eternal
springtime
on
thy
face
so
thou
refuse
to
drink
my
dear
sons
blood
o
reverend
tribunes
o
gentle
aged
men
unbind
my
sons
reverse
the
doom
of
death
and
let
me
say
that
never
wept
before
my
tears
are
now
prevailing
orators
o
noble
father
you
lament
in
vain
the
tribunes
hear
you
not
no
man
is
by
and
you
recount
your
sorrows
to
a
stone
ah
lucius
for
thy
brothers
let
me
plead
grave
tribunes
once
more
i
entreat
of
you
my
gracious
lord
no
tribune
hears
you
speak
why
tis
no
matter
man
if
they
did
hear
they
would
not
mark
me
or
if
they
did
mark
they
would
not
pity
me
yet
plead
i
must
all
bootless
unto
them
therefore
i
tell
my
sorrows
to
the
stones
who
though
they
cannot
answer
my
distress
yet
in
some
sort
they
are
better
than
the
tribunes
for
that
they
will
not
intercept
my
tale
when
i
do
weep
they
humbly
at
my
feet
receive
my
tears
and
seem
to
weep
with
me
and
were
they
but
attired
in
grave
weeds
rome
could
afford
no
tribune
like
to
these
a
stone
is
soft
as
wax
tribunes
more
hard
than
stones
a
stone
is
silent
and
offendeth
not
and
tribunes
with
their
tongues
doom
men
to
death
but
wherefore
standst
thou
with
thy
weapon
drawn
to
rescue
my
two
brothers
from
their
death
for
which
attempt
the
judges
have
pronouncd
my
everlasting
doom
of
banishment
o
happy
man
they
have
befriended
thee
why
foolish
lucius
dost
thou
not
perceive
that
rome
is
but
a
wilderness
of
tigers
tigers
must
prey
and
rome
affords
no
prey
but
me
and
mine
how
happy
art
thou
then
from
these
devourers
to
be
banished
but
who
comes
with
our
brother
marcus
here
titus
prepare
thy
aged
eyes
to
weep
or
if
not
so
thy
noble
heart
to
break
i
bring
consuming
sorrow
to
thine
age
will
it
consume
me
let
me
see
it
then
this
was
thy
daughter
why
marcus
so
she
is
ay
me
this
object
kills
me
fainthearted
boy
arise
and
look
upon
her
speak
lavinia
what
accursed
hand
hath
made
thee
handless
in
thy
fathers
sight
what
fool
hath
added
water
to
the
sea
or
brought
a
faggot
to
brightburning
troy
my
grief
was
at
the
height
before
thou
camst
and
now
like
nilus
it
disdaineth
bounds
give
me
a
sword
ill
chop
off
my
hands
too
for
they
have
fought
for
rome
and
all
in
vain
and
they
have
nursd
this
woe
in
feeding
life
in
bootless
prayer
have
they
been
held
up
and
they
have
servd
me
to
effectless
use
now
all
the
service
i
require
of
them
is
that
the
one
will
help
to
cut
the
other
tis
well
lavinia
that
thou
hast
no
hands
for
hands
to
do
rome
service
are
but
vain
speak
gentle
sister
who
hath
martyrd
thee
o
that
delightful
engine
of
her
thoughts
that
blabbd
them
with
such
pleasing
eloquence
is
torn
from
forth
that
pretty
hollow
cage
where
like
a
sweet
melodious
bird
it
sung
sweet
varied
notes
enchanting
every
ear
o
say
thou
for
her
who
hath
done
this
deed
o
thus
i
found
her
straying
in
the
park
seeking
to
hide
herself
as
doth
the
deer
that
hath
receivd
some
unrecuring
wound
it
was
my
dear
and
he
that
wounded
her
hath
hurt
me
more
than
had
he
killd
me
dead
for
now
i
stand
as
one
upon
a
rock
environd
with
a
wilderness
of
sea
who
marks
the
waxing
tide
grow
wave
by
wave
expecting
ever
when
some
envious
surge
will
in
his
brinish
bowels
swallow
him
this
way
to
death
my
wretched
sons
are
gone
here
stands
my
other
son
a
banishd
man
and
here
my
brother
weeping
at
my
woes
but
that
which
gives
my
soul
the
greatest
spurn
is
dear
lavinia
dearer
than
my
soul
had
i
but
seen
thy
picture
in
this
plight
it
would
have
madded
me
what
shall
i
do
now
i
behold
thy
lively
body
so
thou
hast
no
hands
to
wipe
away
thy
tears
nor
tongue
to
tell
me
who
hath
martyrd
thee
thy
husband
he
is
dead
and
for
his
death
thy
brothers
are
condemnd
and
dead
by
this
look
marcus
ah
son
lucius
look
on
her
when
i
did
name
her
brothers
then
fresh
tears
stood
on
her
cheeks
as
doth
the
honeydew
upon
a
gatherd
lily
almost
witherd
perchance
she
weeps
because
they
killd
her
husband
perchance
because
she
knows
them
innocent
if
they
did
kill
thy
husband
then
be
joyful
because
the
law
hath
taen
revenge
on
them
no
no
they
would
not
do
so
foul
a
deed
witness
the
sorrow
that
their
sister
makes
gentle
lavinia
let
me
kiss
thy
lips
or
make
some
sign
how
i
may
do
thee
ease
shall
thy
good
uncle
and
thy
brother
lucius
and
thou
and
i
sit
round
about
some
fountain
looking
all
downwards
to
behold
our
cheeks
how
they
are
staind
like
meadows
yet
not
dry
with
miry
alime
left
on
them
by
a
flood
and
in
the
fountain
shall
we
gaze
so
long
till
the
fresh
taste
be
taken
from
that
clearness
and
made
a
brinepit
with
our
bitter
tears
or
shall
we
cut
away
our
hands
like
thine
or
shall
we
bite
our
tongues
and
in
dumb
shows
pass
the
remainder
of
our
hateful
days
what
shall
we
do
let
us
that
have
our
tongues
plot
some
device
of
further
misery
to
make
us
wonderd
at
in
time
to
come
sweet
father
cease
your
tears
for
at
your
grief

how
my
wretched
sister

and
weeps

his
true
tears

service
on
her
sorrowful
cheeks
o
what
a
sympathy
of
woe
is
this
as
far
from

as
limbo

from
bliss
titus
andronicus
my
lord
the
emperor
sends
thee
this
word

merited
that
let
it

as
for
my
sons
say
i
account
of
them
as
jewels
purchasd
at
an
easy
price
and
yet
dear
too
because
i
bought
mine
own
i
go
andronicus
and
for
thy
hand
look
by
and
by
to
have
thy
sons
with
thee
their
heads
i
mean
o
how
this
villany
doth
fat
me
with
the
very
thoughts
of
it
let
fools
do
good
and
fair
men
call
for
grace
aaron
will
have
his
soul
black
like
his
face
o
here
i
lift
this
one
hand
up
to
heaven
and
how
this
feeble
ruin
to
the
earth
if
any
power
pities
wretched
tears
to
that
i
call
what
wilt
thou
kneel
with
me
do
then
dear
heart
for
heaven
shall
hear
our
prayers
or
with
our
sighs
well
breathe
the
welkin
dim
and
stain
the
sun
with
fog
as
sometime
clouds
when
they
do
hug
him
in
their
melting
bosoms
o
brother
speak
with
possibilities
and
do
not
break
into
these
deep
extremes
is
not
my
sorrow
deep
having
no
bottom
then
be
my
passions
bottomless
with
them
but
yet
let
reason
govern
thy
lament
if
there
were
reason
for
these
miseries
then
into
limits
could
i
bind
my
woes
when
heaven
doth
weep
doth
not
the
earth
oerflow
if
the
winds
rage
doth
not
the
sea
wax
mad
threatning
the
welkin
with
his
bigswoln
face
and
wilt
thou
have
a
reason
for
this
coil
i
am
the
sea
hark
how
her
sighs
do
blow
she
is
the
weeping
welkin
i
the
earth
then
must
my
sea
be
moved
with
her
sighs
then
must
my
earth
with
her
continual
tears
become
a
deluge
overflowd
and
drownd
for
why
my
bowels
cannot
hide
her
woes
but
like
a
drunkard
must
i
vomit
them
then
give
me
leave
for
losers
will
have
leave
to
ease
their
stomachs
with
their
bitter
tongues
worthy
andronicus
ill
art
thou
repaid
for
that
good
hand
thou
sentst
the
emperor
here
are
the
heads
of
thy
two
noble
sons
and
heres
thy
hand
in
scorn
to
thee
sent
back
thy
griefs
their
sports
thy
resolution
mockd
that
woe
is
me
to
think
upon
thy
woes
more
than
remembrance
of
my
fathers
death
now
let
hot
tna
cool
in
sicily
and
be
my
heart
an
ever
burning
hell
these
miseries
are
more
than
may
be
borne
to
weep
with
them
that
weep
doth
ease
some
deal
but
sorrow
flouted
at
is
double
death
ah
that
this
sight
should
make
so
deep
a
wound
and
yet
detested
life
not
shrink
thereat
that
ever
death
should
let
life
bear
his
name
where
life
hath
no
more
interest
but
to
breathe
alas
poor
heart
that
kiss
is
comfortless
as
frozen
water
to
a
starved
snake
when
will
this
fearful
slumber
have
an
end
now
farewell
flattery
die
andronicus
thou
dost
not
slumber
see
thy
two
sons
heads
thy
warlike
hand
thy
mangled
daughter
here
thy
other
banishd
son
with
this
dear
sight
struck
pale
and
bloodless
and
thy
brother
i
even
like
a
stony
image
cold
and
numb
ah
now
no
more
will
i
control
thy
griefs
rent
off
thy
silver
hair
thy
other
hand
gnawing
with
thy
teeth
and
be
this
dismal
sight
the
closing
up
of
our
most
wretched
eyes
now
is
a
time
to
storm
why
art
thou
still
ha
ha
ha
why
dost
thou
laugh
it
fits
not
with
this
hour
why
i
have
not
another
tear
to
shed
besides
this
sorrow
is
an
enemy
and
would
usurp
upon
my
watery
eyes
and
make
them
blind
with
tributary
tears
then
which
way
shall
i
find
revenges
cave
for
these
two
heads
do
seem
to
speak
to
me
and
threat
me
i
shall
never
come
to
bliss
till
all
these
mischiefs
be
returnd
again
even
in
their
throats
that
have
committed
them
come
let
me
see
what
task
i
have
to
do

heavy
people

me
about
that
i
may
turn
me
to
each
one
of
you
and
swear
unto
my
soul
to
right
your
wrongs
the
vow
is
made
come

left
to
tyrannize
upon
my
breast
and
when
my
heart
all
mad
with
misery
beats
in
this
hollow
prison
of
my
flesh

dost
talk
in
signs
when

with
outrageous
beating

not
strike
it
thus
to
make
it

with
sighing
girl
kill
it
with
groans
or
get
some
little
knife
between
thy
teeth
and
just
against
thy
heart
make
thou
a
hole
that
all
the
tears
that
thy
poor

no
man
should
be
mad
but
i
what
violent

on
her
life

thy
stumps
to

noble
aunt

me
as
dear
as
eer
my
mother

goths
have
gatherd

and
with
a
power
of
highresolved
men
bent
to
the
spoil
they
hither
march
amain
under
conduct
of
lucius
son
to
old
andronicus
who
threats
in
course
of
this
revenge
to
do
as
much
as
ever
coriolanus
did
is
warlike
lucius
general
of
the
goths
these
tidings
nip
me
and
i
hang
the
head
as

with
frost
or
grass
beat
down
with
storms
ay
now
begin
our
sorrows
to
approach
tis
he
the
common
people
love
so
much
myself
hath
often
heard
them
say
when
i
have
walked
like
a
private
man
that
lucius
banishment
was
wrongfully
and
they
have
wishd
that
lucius
were
their
emperor
why
should
you
fear
is
not
your
city
strong
ay
but
the
citizens
favour
lucius
and
will
revolt
from
me
to
succour
him
king
be
thy
thoughts
imperious
like
thy
name
is
the
sun
dimmd
that
gnats
do
fly
in
it
the
eagle
suffers
little
birds
to
sing
and
is
not
careful
what
they
mean
thereby
knowing
that
with
the
shadow
of
his
wings
he
can
at
pleasure
stint
their
melody
even
so
mayst
thou
the
giddy
men
of
rome
then
cheer
thy
spirit
for
know
thou
emperor
i
will
enchant
the
old
andronicus
with
words
more
sweet
and
yet
more
dangerous
than
baits
to
fish
or
honeystalks
to
sheep
whenas
the
one
is
wounded
with
the
bait
the
other
rotted
with
delicious
feed
but
he
will
not
entreat
his
son
for
us
if
tamora
entreat
him
then
he
will
for
i
can
smooth
and
fill
his
aged
ear
with
golden
promises
that
were
his
heart
almost
impregnable
his
old
ears
deaf
yet
should
both
ear
and
heart
obey
my
tongue
go
thou
before
be
our
ambassador
say
that
the
emperor
requests
a
parley
of
warlike
lucius
and
appoint
the
meeting
even
at
his
fathers
house
the
old
andronicus
milius
do
this
message
honourably
and
if
he
stand
on
hostage
for
his
safety
bid
him
demand
what
pledge
will
please
him
best
your
bidding
shall
i
do
effectually
now
will
i
to
that
old
andronicus
and
temper
him
with
all
the
art
i
have
to
pluck
proud
lucius
from
the
warlike
goths
and
now
sweet
emperor
be
blithe
again
and
bury
all
thy
fear
in
my
devices
then
go
successantly
and
plead
to
him
approved
warriors
and
my
faithful
friends
i
have
received
letters
from
great
rome
which
signify
what
hate
they
bear
their
emperor
and
how
desirous
of
our
sight
they
are
therefore
great
lords
be
as
your
titles
witness
imperious
and
impatient
of
your
wrongs
and
wherein
rome
hath
done
you
any
scath
let
him
make
treble
satisfaction
brave
slip
sprung
from
the
great
andronicus
whose
name
was
once
our
terror
now
our
comfort
whose
high
exploits
and
honourable
deeds
ingrateful
rome
requites
with
foul
contempt
be
bold
in
us
well
follow
where
thou
leadst
like
stinging
bees
in
hottest
summers
day
led
by
their
master
to
the
flowerd
fields
and
be
avengd
on
cursed
tamora
and
as
he
saith
so
say
we
all
with
him
i
humbly
thank
him
and
i
thank
you
all
but
who
comes
here
led
by
a
lusty
goth
renowned
lucius
from
our
troops
i
strayd
to
gaze
upon
a
ruinous
monastery
and
as
i
earnestly
did
fix
mine
eye
upon
the
wasted
building
suddenly
i
heard
a
child
cry
underneath
a
wall
i
made
unto
the
noise
when
soon
i
heard
the
crying
babe
controlld
with
this
discourse
peace
tawny
slave
half
me
and
half
thy
dam
did
not
thy
hue
bewray
whose
brat
thou
art
had
nature
lent
thee
but
thy
mothers
look
villain
thou
mightst
have
been
an
emperor
but
where
the
bull
and
cow
are
both
milkwhite
they
never
do
beget
a
coalblack
calf
peace
villain
peace
even
thus
he
rates
the
babe
for
i
must
bear
thee
to
a
trusty
goth
who
when
he
knows
thou
art
the
empress
babe
will
hold
thee
dearly
for
thy
mothers
sake
with
this
my
weapon
drawn
i
rushd
upon
him
surprisd
him
suddenly
and
brought
him
hither
to
use
as
you
think
needful
of
the
man
o
worthy
goth
this
is
the
incarnate
devil
that
robbd
andronicus
of
his
good
hand
this
is
the
pearl
that
pleasd
your
empress
eye
and
heres
the
base
fruit
of
his
burning
lust
say
walleyd
slave
whither
wouldst
thou
convey
this
growing
image
of
thy
fiendlike
face
why
dost
not
speak
what
deaf
not
a
word
a
halter
soldiers
hang
him
on
this
tree
and
by
his
side
his
fruit
of
bastardy
touch
not
the
boy
he
is
of
royal
blood
too
like
the
sire
for
ever
being
good
first
hang
the
child
that
he
may
see
it
sprawl
a
sight
to
vex
the
fathers
soul
withal
get
me
a
ladder
lucius
save
the
child
and
bear
it
from
me
to
the
empress
if
thou
do
this
ill
show
thee
wondrous
things
that
highly
may
advantage
thee
to
hear
if
thou
wilt
not
befall
what
may
befall
ill
speak
no
more
but
vengeance
rot
you
all
say
on
and
if
it
please
me
which
thou
speakst
thy
child
shall
live
and
i
will
see
it
nourishd
an
if
it
please
thee
why
assure
thee
lucius
twill
vexthy
soul
to
hear
what
i
shall
speak
for
i
must
talk
of
murders
rapes
and
massacres
acts
of
black
night
abominable
deeds
complots
of
mischief
treason
villanies
ruthful
to
hear
yet
piteously
performd
and
this
shall
all
be
buried
by
my
death
unless
thou
swear
to
me
my
child
shall
live
tell
on
thy
mind
i
say
thy
child
shall
live
swear
that
he
shall
and
then
i
will
begin
who
should
i
swear
by
thou
believst
no
god
that
granted
how
canst
thou
believe
an
oath
what
if
i
do
not
as
indeed
i
do
not
yet
for
i
know
thou
art
religious
and
hast
a
thing
within
thee
called
conscience
with
twenty
popish
tricks
and
ceremonies
which
i
have
seen
thee
careful
to
observe
therefore
i
urge
thy
oath
for
that
i
know
an
idiot
holds
his
bauble
for
a
god
and
keeps
the
oath
which
by
that
god
he
swears
to
that
ill
urge
him
therefore
thou
shalt
vow
by
that
same
god
what
god
soeer
it
be
that
thou
adorst
and
hast
in
reverence
to
save
my
boy
to
nourish
and
bring
him
up
or
else
i
will
discover
nought
to
thee
even
by
my
god
i
swear
to
thee
i
will
first
know
thou
i
begot
him
on
the
empress
o
most
insatiate
and
luxurious
woman
tut
lucius
this
was
but
a
deed
of
charity
to
that
which
thou
shalt
hear
of
me
anon
twas
her
two
sons
that
murderd
bassianus
they
cut
thy
sisters
tongue
and
ravishd
her
and
cut
her
hands
and
trimmd
her
as
thou
sawst
o
detestable
villain
callst
thou
that
trimming
why
she
was
washd
and
cut
and
trimmd
and
twas
trim
sport
for
them
that
had
the
doing
of
it
o
barbarous
beastly
villains
like
thyself
indeed
i
was
their
tutor
to
instruct
them
that
codding
spirit
had
they
from
their
mother
as
sure
a
card
as
ever
won
the
set
that
bloody
mind
i
think
they
learnd
of
me
as
true
a
dog
as
ever
fought
at
head
well
let
my
deeds
be
witness
of
my
worth
i
traind
thy
brethren
to
that
guileful
hole
where
the
dead
corpse
of
bassianus
lay
i
wrote
the
letter
that
thy
father
found
and
hid
the
gold
within
the
letter
mentiond
confederate
with
the
queen
and
her
two
sons
and
what
not
done
that
thou
hast
cause
to
rue
wherein
i
had
no
stroke
of
mischief
in
it
i
playd
the
cheater
for
thy
fathers
hand
and
when
i
had
it
drew
myself
apart
and
almost
broke
my
heart
with
extreme
laughter
i
pryd
me
through
the
crevice
of
a
wall
when
for
his
hand
he
had
his
two
sons
heads
beheld
his
tears
and
laughd
so
heartily
that
both
mine
eyes
were
rainy
like
to
his
and
when
i
told
the
empress
of
this
sport
she
swounded
almost
at
my
pleasing
tale
and
for
my
tidings
gave
me
twenty
kisses
what
canst
thou
say
all
this
and
never
blush
ay
like
a
black
dog
as
the
saying
is
art
thou
not
sorry
for
these
heinous
deeds
ay
that
i
had
not
done
a
thousand
more
even
now
i
curse
the
day
and
yet
i
think
few
come
within
the
compass
of
my
curse
wherein
i
did
not
some
notorious
ill
as
kill
a
man
or
else
devise
his
death
ravish
a
maid
or
plot
the
way
to
do
it
accuse
some
innocent
and
forswear
myself
set
deadly
enmity
between
two
friends
make
poor
mens
cattle
break
their
necks
set
fire
on
barns
and
haystacks
in
the
night
and
bid
the
owners
quench
them
with
their
tears
oft
have
i
diggd
up
dead
men
from
their
graves
and
set
them
upright
at
their
dear
friends
doors
even
when
their
sorrows
almost
were
forgot
and
on
their
skins
as
on
the
bark
of
trees
have
with
my
knife
carved
in
roman
letters
let
not
your
sorrow
die
though
i
am
dead
tut
i
have
done
a
thousand
dreadful
things
as
willingly
as
one
would
kill
a
fly
and
nothing
grieves
me
heartily
indeed
but
that
i
cannot
do
ten
thousand
more
bring
down
the
devil
for
he
must
not
die
so
sweet
a
death
as
hanging
presently
if
there
be
devils
would
i
were
a
devil
to
live
and
burn
in
everlasting
fire
so
i
might
have
your
company
in
hell
but
to
torment
you
with
my
bitter
tongue
sirs
stop
his
mouth
and
let
him
speak
no
more

lord

rome

romes
dear
friend
as
erst
our
ancestor
when
with
his
solemn
tongue
he
did
discourse
to
lovesick
didos
sad
attending

the
story
of
that
baleful
burning
night
when
subtle
greeks
surprisd
king
priams
troy
tell
us
what
sinon
hath
bewitchd
our
ears
or
who
hath
brought
the
fatal
engine
in
that
gives
our
troy
our
rome
the
civil
wound
my
heart
is
not
compact
of
flint
nor
steel
nor
can
i
utter
all
our
bitter
grief
but
floods
of
tears
will
drown
my
oratory
and
break
my
very
utterance
even
in
the
time
when
it
should
move
you
to
attend
me
most
lending
your
kind
commiseration
here
is
a
captain

him
tell
the
tale

throb
and

to
hear
him
speak

noble
auditory

it
known
to
you
that
cursed
chiron
and
demetrius
were
they
that
murdered
our
emperors
brother

they
it
was
that
ravished
our
sister
for
their
fell
faults
our
brothers
were
beheaded

despisd
and
basely
cozend
of
that
true
hand
that
fought
romes
quarrel
out
and
sent
her
enemies
unto
the
grave
lastly
myself
unkindly
banished
the
gates
shut
on
me
and
turnd
weeping
out
to
beg
relief
among
romes
enemies
who
drownd
their
enmity
in
my
true
tears
and
opd
their
arms
to
embrace
me
as
a
friend
and
i
am
the
turnd
forth
be

known
to
you
that
have
preservd
her
welfare
in
my
blood
and
from
her
bosom
took
the
enemys
point
sheathing
the
steel
in
my
adventurous
body
alas
you
know
i
am
no
vaunter
i
my
scars
can
witness
dumb
although
they
are
that
my
report
is
just
and
full
of
truth
but
soft
methinks
i
do
digress
too
much
citing
my
worthless
praise
o
pardon
me
for
when
no
friends
are
by
men
praise
themselves
now
is
my
turn
to
speak
behold
this
child
of
this
was
tamora
delivered

issue
of
an
irreligious
moor
chief
architect
and
plotter

these
woes

thee
on
his
knee
sung
thee
asleep
his
loving
breast
thy
pillow
many
a
matter
hath
he
told
to
thee
meet
and
agreeing
with
thine
infancy
in
that
respect
then
like
a
loving
child
shed
yet
some
small
drops
from
thy
tender
spring

tears

choke
me
if

mouth
you
sad
andronici
have
done
with
woes
give
sentence
on
this
execrable
wretch
that

dire
events
set
him
breastdeep
in
earth
and
famish
him
there
let
him
stand
and
rave
and
cry
for
food
if
any
one
relieves
or
pities
him
for
the
offence
he
dies
this
is
our
doom
some
stay
to
see
him
fastend
in
the
earth
o
why
should
wrath
be
mute
and
fury
dumb
i
am
no
baby
i
that
with
base
prayers
i
should
repent
the
evils
i
have
done
ten
thousand
worse
than
ever
yet
i
did
would
i
perform
if
i
might
have
my
will
if
one
good
deed
in
all
my
life
i
did
i
do
repent
it
from
my
very
soul
some
loving
friends
convey
the
emperor
hence
and
give
him
burial
in
his
fathers
grave
my
father
and
lavinia
shall
forthwith
be
closed
in
our

monument
as
for
that
heinous
tiger
tamora
no
funeral
rite
nor

mournful
weeds
no
mournful
bell
shall
ring
her
burial
but
throw
her
forth
to
beasts
and
birds
of
prey
her
life
was
beastlike
and
devoid
of
pity
and
being
so
shall
have
like
want
of
pity
see
justice
done
on
aaron
that
damnd
moor
by
whom
our
heavy
haps
had
their
beginning
then
afterwards
to
order
well
the
state
that
like
events
may
neer
it
ruinate
